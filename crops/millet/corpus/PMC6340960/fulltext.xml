An assumption underlying the literature on maximizing is that the tendency to strive to make the best choice spans domains. The current research provides a direct test of this assumption by examining the association between trait maximizing and domain-specific maximizing, consisting of maximizing measures in a wide range of decisions (consumer goods, services and experiences, and life decisions). Study 1 tested this association at two different time points in order to minimize common method bias. Study 2 was a high-powered pre-registered cross-sectional replication. Results of both studies showed that trait maximizing was associated with higher maximizing tendencies across all three decision domains. However, in line with prior research suggesting that people generally maximize less in experiential than in material domains, trait maximizing was associated with maximizing in services and experiences significantly less than with maximizing in consumer goods or in life decisions. These results provide empirical support for a central tenet of maximizing theory and suggest useful directions for future research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>maximizing</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>decision domains</kwd><kwd>consumer goods</kwd><kwd>experiences</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The construct of maximizing describes individual differences in the tendency to strive to make the best choice (for reviews, see <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Cheek and Schwartz, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Misuraca and Fasolo, 2018</xref>). Implicit in the research on maximizing is the assumption that this tendency is expressed across decision domains (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Misuraca et al., 2015</xref>). Although this assumption seems to be a central tenet of the maximizing theory, not much research has put this explicitly into test.</p><p>Initial supportive evidence has been provided by <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Misuraca et al. (2015)</xref>, but only in a limited number of decision domains (car purchase, shopping for clothes, job search, housing search, graduate school offers; consumer and professional/career domain, respectively). Evidence across many more decision domains (e.g., clothes, cars, movies, sex life, job offers, friends, school grades, or yearly income) has been provided by <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al. (2015)</xref>. However, a limitation of this study is that it used the Maximization Scale (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>), which has been criticized for not adequately measuring maximizing (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lai, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Rim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Weinhardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Dalal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Misuraca et al., 2015</xref>). For example, this scale might be confounding maximizing (having high standards when choosing) with decision difficulty (experiencing difficulty in choosing) and alternative search (searching extensively before choosing), which may be correlates of the maximizing construct but not parts of its definition. Other weaknesses of the Maximization Scale include poor psychometric properties and outdated items (e.g., about video rental). These limitations have led the authors of this scale to later revise it (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Nenkov et al., 2008</xref>) and more recently even recommend other scales as better alternatives (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Cheek and Schwartz, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The current study constitutes the first systematic attempt to directly test the assumption that maximizers maximize across a wide range of decision domains by overcoming the shortcomings of prior studies that either tested this assumption in a limited number of domains or used problematic measures of maximizing. In line with prior theorizing, maximizing was conceptualized as a global decision-making tendency that is reflected in various decision tasks. The present article examined whether trait maximizing is associated with maximizing in decisions concerning consumer goods, decisions concerning experiences and services, and important life decisions. Decisions related to consumer goods have been extensively studied in the maximizing literature (e.g., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kokkoris, 2018</xref>). Decisions related to experiences and services have been studied in the maximizing literature to a lesser degree. It has been suggested that people are generally less likely to maximize in the experiential domain, mainly because decision outcomes in this domain are harder to compare and thus one can never know what the best choice really is (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Gilovich, 2010</xref>). For example, whereas one can strive to choose the best smartphone (consumer good) based on some objective criteria, this is harder to do for a holiday (experience). Finally, life decisions have also been examined in the context of maximizing. A general maximizing tendency has been associated with maximizing in romantic relationships (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Mikkelson and Pauley, 2013</xref>), friendships (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Newman et al., 2018</xref>), or academic and professional decisions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Iyengar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Dahling and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Leach and Patall, 2013</xref>). However, conclusions drawn from these studies are again limited due to the use of the Maximization Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1</title><p>Study 1 examined the associations (assessed in two separate time points to minimize common method bias) between trait maximizing and maximizing tendencies across a variety of decision domains.</p><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>One-hundred thirty-two United States residents recruited on Prolific Academic participated in the first survey.

In the second survey, participants were presented with a list of 29 decision domains: consumer goods (bottled water; food; detergent; clothes; shoes; sunglasses; perfume; furniture; smartphone; laptop; car); experiences and services (gym; film; book; concert; TV series; restaurant; meal in a restaurant; caf&#x000e9;/bar; drink in a bar; hotel room; holiday destination); and life decisions (area of residence; apartment; job; employer; studies; friends; partner). For each domain, participants had to indicate on a 6-point scale to what extent they want to make the best choice in the respective domain (6) or it is enough for them to choose an option that is satisfactory and good enough (1). The presentation order of the domains was randomized for every participant.

The current research goes beyond prior research in the following ways. First, although some previous studies have provided evidence that maximizing is expressed in various domains (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Iyengar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Dahling and Thompson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Leach and Patall, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Mikkelson and Pauley, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Newman et al., 2018</xref>), all of these studies used a rather inadequate measure of maximizing (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 2002</xref>). The present research, using a much more appropriate measure of maximizing (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al., 2008</xref>), was able to provide more valid evidence in support of this association. Second, even the studies that used more sound measures of maximizing often provided evidence in only a few domains (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diab et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Misuraca et al., 2015</xref>). The current research encompasses a much wider range of domains in a more systematic way. Third, unlike prior research that relied mostly on cross-sectional designs, the current research used a two-stage design that assessed the main variables in different time points (Study 1). Another contribution of this article is that it extends research on people&#x02019;s tendency to maximize less in experiential than material purchases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Gilovich, 2010</xref>) by showing that maximizers follow this pattern, too. Future research could employ behavioral tasks as a more direct measure of domain-specific maximizing beyond the self-report measures used here, as well as expand decision domains to medical or financial decision making.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Full review and approval by an ethics committee was not required according to the local and national guidelines.
