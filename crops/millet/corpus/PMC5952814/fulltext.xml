The study setting comprised two remote mountain villages from a mid-western mountain district of Nepal that ranks lowest on the Human Development Index (0.304), and is reported as having the lowest child survival rates in the country.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The findings are taken from a larger study of perinatal survival in remote mountain villages of Nepal, conducted through a qualitative methodological approach within a framework of social constructionist and critical theoretical perspectives. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 42 women and their families, plus a range of healthcare providers (nurses/auxiliary nurses, female health volunteers, support staff, Auxiliary Health Worker and a traditional healer) and other stakeholders from February to June, 2015. Data were analysed with a comprehensive coding process utilising the thematic analysis technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The social construction of gender is one of the key factors influencing poor perinatal survival in the villages in this study. The key emerging themes from the qualitative data are: (1) Gendered social construct and vulnerability for poor perinatal survival: child marriages, son preference and repeated child bearing; (2) Pregnancy and childbirth in intra-familial dynamics of relationships and power; and (3) Perception of birth as a polluted event: birth in <italic>Gotha</italic> (cowshed) and giving birth alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Motherhood among women of a low social position is central to women and their babies experiencing vulnerabilities related to perinatal survival in the mountain villages. Gendered constructions along the continuum from pre-pregnancy to postnatal (girl settlement, a daughter-in-law, ritual pollution about mother and child) create challenges to ensuring perinatal survival in these villages. It is imperative that policies and programmes consider such a context to develop effective working strategies for sustained reduction of future perinatal deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12884-018-1776-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Motherhood</kwd><kwd>Perinatal survival</kwd><kwd>Mountain</kwd><kwd>Childbirth</kwd><kwd>Gender</kwd><kwd>Nepal</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001785</institution-id><institution>Flinders University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Not Applicable</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paudel</surname><given-names>Mohan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">The perinatal period is considered critical in terms of saving the lives of mothers, preventing stillbirths and neonatal deaths as well as in ensuring a healthy future generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Perinatal deaths include pregnancy losses after 22&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation (stillbirths) and neonatal deaths within the first seven days (week) after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Measurement of perinatal mortality within this window is commonly used for international comparisons of mortality rates. An extended perinatal period that includes stillbirths plus neonatal deaths within the first 28&#x000a0;days (month) after birth, is also in use, such as that reported in US and Australian studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The extended perinatal period is useful to monitor and examine deaths across the gestation age spectrum, and this is applied in the present paper unless otherwise specified separately as stillbirth or neonatal death.</p><p id="Par11">Prevention of perinatal deaths is a global public health priority. In 2015, the global stillbirth rate was 19 per 1000 births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and the neonatal mortality rate was 21 per 1000 livebirths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Worldwide, more than 14,500 perinatal deaths are reported daily, comprising both stillbirths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2015 neonatal deaths comprised almost half (45%) of global under-five deaths and 75% of all infant deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Of the total neonatal deaths, more than two-thirds occur within the first week of life (early neonatal deaths). It is also known that almost all perinatal deaths (98%) occur in developing countries; 75% in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With current rates of reduction, it is estimated to take more than 100&#x000a0;years for women living in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa to achieve a perinatal survival rate similar to that of women in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Poor perinatal survival is one of the major public health problems in Nepal. Although Nepal is one of the few developing countries to have achieved the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of reducing under five mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], its perinatal mortality rate is still very high compared to infant and under-five mortality rates. Nepal records more than 30,000 perinatal deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most recent data on child mortality at the time this study commenced are from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS 2012), which show the perinatal mortality rate for Nepal was 37 per 1000 total births (stillbirths and early neonatal deaths within 7&#x000a0;days after birth combined) while the neonatal mortality rate was 33 per 1000 livebirths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These rates are unequally distributed with Nepal&#x02019;s mountainous region having one of the highest such rates in the world - a neonatal mortality rate of 46/1000 livebirths and a perinatal mortality rate of more than 40 per 1000 total births (stillbirths and early neonatal deaths ie within the first week after birth), which are equivalent to the highest rates in Sub Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nepal&#x02019;s demographic survey report does not currently include an extended perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths plus neonatal deaths within the first month after birth), and with these missing deaths incorporated Nepal would likely have a significantly high extended perinatal mortality rate.</p><p id="Par13">Globally, there is abundant literature on the epidemiology of perinatal deaths: the &#x0201c;when, where and why&#x0201d;, with a list of proven interventions to improve perinatal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, these studies explain perinatal survival predominantly from a bio-medical standpoint, identifying prematurity, asphyxia and infection as the main causes of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The influence of gender and social determinants, which are widely discussed in relation to maternal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and under-five child mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], have been scarcely discussed in relation to poor perinatal survival.</p><p id="Par14">Gender is one of the major social determinants of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], influencing reproductive behaviour, healthcare access and perinatal survival. Gender includes socially and culturally constructed roles that men and women play, and the relations that arise from such roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. An examination of gendered contexts comprises studies of different behaviour, roles, responsibilities and expectations of men and women and their influence on health and sickness responses. Gendered roles and responsibilities shape access/resources, which in turn are shaped by gender based norms and values. Gendered perspectives have been discussed mostly in relation to the survival of older children and pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, male children have a 20% higher chance of survival during the first and the fourth years of life in Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A range of studies from South Asia discusses gender as an important factor impacting maternal and child survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, few studies describe gendered constructions and their influences, particularly on perinatal survival.</p><p id="Par15">Perinatal survival is often considered technically as requiring improvements predominantly in the medical aspects of perinatal deaths. The <italic>Lancet</italic> papers attempted to demystify the myth that only highly technical medical solutions can reduce perinatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; however, the suggested interventions still remain medically based. The impact of the gendered cultural context of pregnancy and childbirth, which this paper aims to examine, has not been well considered in remote Nepal other than the mere statement of an aim for gender equality in Nepal&#x02019;s policy related documents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The literature about perinatal survival discusses mainly sex-specific differentials of stillbirths and neonatal mortality, often concluding higher survival chances of female babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While discussing perinatal survival, the above mentioned studies lack consideration of how gendered aspects before and during pregnancy and childbirth impact perinatal survival outcomes in pregnancy and after birth. Some studies report female foeticide in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the impact of differential care seeking for newborn girls in Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and greater risk for baby girls during the late neonatal period in the southern plains region of Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Still, an in-depth examination of the gender and cultural contexts of perinatal deaths has not been a focus in any of these studies.</p><p id="Par16">After the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994, the gendered position of woman was acknowledged as crucial in personal health and overall reproductive health including in decisions regarding when to marry, and whether, when and how many babies to have [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, women and children have continued to suffer from biased gender norms and relations in many ways. The child&#x02019;s sex is found to intersect with fertility behaviour; there are closely spaced pregnancies in places where there is a strong preference for male children. It is estimated that family planning (spacing, limiting births and delaying) alone could avert 60% of maternal and 57% of child deaths worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Unintended pregnancies and pregnancies at young age produce significant risks of maternal as well as neonatal and child death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In many developing countries, women&#x02019;s access to care during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period is influenced by the decisions of their mother-in-law and husband [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. A previous study in Nepal&#x02019;s capital Kathmandu found that men&#x02019;s and women&#x02019;s cultural positions impeded the uptake of biomedical birthing care, while two other studies found that mothers-in-law play significant roles: in Kathmandu Valley they negatively influence access to pregnancy care, but in the remote areas positively influence birth preparedness and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Although information about the patterns and distribution of perinatal mortality is available from various studies in both the hills and plains regions of Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], studies from the mountainous regions are rare. The available studies either describe medical causes of perinatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] or merely report the pattern of health service utilisation and mortality outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. These studies are mostly cross-sectional surveys or further analysis of reports of national demographic and health surveys. In general, in-depth, qualitative studies examining poor perinatal survival are lacking in Nepal. Moreover, although it is known that the mountainous region has the highest death rates and the lowest utilisation of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal services by women, a socio-cultural explanation is lacking behind these high perinatal mortality rates and low service uptake in the mountainous region. In this regard, the present in-depth qualitative study adds to the literature by investigating the gendered contexts of poor perinatal survival in Nepal&#x02019;s mountain villages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par18">We conducted a qualitative study utilising social constructionist and critical theoretical approaches to examine the gendered cultural contexts of poor perinatal survival in the mountain villages. Social constructionism and critical theoretical perspectives fit with the study&#x02019;s socio-cultural approach and guided the choice of research method&#x02014;policy review and qualitative interviews, analytical technique&#x02014;the inductive thematic analysis, and discussion that revolves around gender, which is seen as a structural force underlying the ongoing poor perinatal survival rates in the mountain villages. A qualitative approach allowed the first author to listen to the voices of unheard, silenced and marginalised groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], ie of the vulnerable ethnic women losing their babies. This also allowed an understanding of the participants&#x02019; experience in a much more considerate way than the structured positivist approach of quantitative surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The study&#x02019;s methodological approach also fits the objective of examining the gendered cultural construction of poor perinatal survival by soliciting the experiences of women and their families about why they think they experienced perinatal deaths, their beliefs and their care seeking behaviour for mother and baby. The study was conducted in Mugu district, one of the remote mountain districts with the lowest Human Development Index (0.304) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and reportedly the lowest child survival rates in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection and participant recruitment</title><p id="Par19">The interviews were conducted by the first author<bold>&#x02014;</bold>a Nepali national with seven years&#x02019; experience of working in the health field in Nepal.

These primary data were supplemented by a review of six key Nepalese policy documents related to perinatal survival and field notes taken during the fieldwork (February to June 2015). The in-depth interviews <bold>(see</bold> Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref><bold>)</bold> were considered crucial to explore in detail the phenomenon of perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Participant recruitment started by purposively selecting the district, and selection of two study villages after consultations with the District Health Office. The religio-cultural composition, relatively larger population size and availability of childbirth service in the chosen villages provided a community lab to study the socio-cultural contexts of poor perinatal survival. The first village had approximately 4000 people following Hindu religious beliefs, and the second village about 3000 people of Hindu faith as well as those <italic>(Lama)</italic> following Buddhist beliefs. Both villages had access to local health facilities, and birthing units within one&#x000a0;hour walk. The first village had also an access to district level hospital within one&#x000a0;hour walk, while the hospital was at about seven hours&#x02019; walking distance from the second village. The villagers live in densely populated small settlement areas, in mud and stone huts shared together with cattle on the ground floor, locally described as <italic>Gotha</italic>. These huts/households are often adjoining with each other.</p><p id="Par21">Participants were recruited via female health volunteers, a social mobiliser and a health worker as gate keepers. Women and families were informed via these gate keepers to contact them if they had recently experienced a perinatal death (in the previous four years), and wished to be part of this study. The gate keepers were locally trusted individuals who had opportunities to inform women and families during their everyday contacts in the neighbourhood, such as while fetching water or walking to and from the forest. The gate keepers provided a list of women willing to participate in the study, which was reviewed by the first author, who made further contact with eligible participants to confirm their participation. Recruitment continued until saturation, ie participants ideas started repeating and no specific new idea emerged, which was decided based on the first author&#x02019;s repeated listening to interview records and field notes. Local health workers, nurses/auxiliary nurses, female health volunteers and local stakeholders were interviewed to supplement women&#x02019;s interviews to include their rich day to day experiences related to childbirth and perinatal survival. As Devers and Frankel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] have described, utilising the gate keepers as recruiters created trust in the villagers. Some participants were also recruited via other participants&#x02019; contacts (snowballing). All interviews were digitally recorded with the permission of the participants, and before the start of each interview, written informed consent was sought from each participant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par22">The interview records were simultaneously translated into and transcribed in English by the first author. Six random transcripts were checked by five bilinguals (Nepali and English) experts who were current and past PhD students of Flinders University. During the fieldwork, the first author immersed himself in the recordings, noted key local terms and any queries, and verified these with participants. The data were analysed using thematic analysis techniques proposed by Braun and Clarke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and organised using the qualitative data analysis software NVivo Version 10:00, that also facilitated the coding process. The themes are the key concepts emerging from the data, which in this study relate to gender and cultural contexts and perinatal survival in the mountain villages. The analysis followed Braun and Clarke&#x02019;s six phases: familiarisation with the data including transcribing; coding; searching for themes; reviewing themes; defining and naming themes; and reporting findings. The process from coding to theme generation was closely scrutinized by the three supervisors and any inconsistencies in code generation and theme development were settled by discussion in monthly meetings during the larger Ph.D. project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] on which this paper is based.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par23">This study went through ethics approval as per Australia&#x02019;s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), and followed the NHMRC&#x02019;s universal standards of research ethics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

However, it is common practice, especially in remote areas, to continue the tradition of getting daughters married well below this age. As such, they become child brides and child mothers. In these villages early marriage, early childbirth and subsequent perinatal deaths were common among the majority of participants. A majority of the women (38 out of 42) were married and had their first birth before age 18, with 10 of the 42 having been married at or before age 14. Early marriage was not considered a matter for concern, with most participants not expressing any negative feelings about this. A 16&#x000a0;year-old mother who gave birth last year and lost her first newborn considered it normal and common in the village:<disp-quote><p id="Par27">

A formal cultural ceremony then occurred at about 11&#x000a0;years old, when the girl was perceived to be ready to leave her parents&#x02019; home. Over the last few years such practice has changed from early age cultural contracts to <italic>Bhagi Bibaha</italic>, a growing culture of marriage at early and mid-teenage years, held usually without a cultural ceremony and often kept secret from the police and local political activists, as these marriages contravene the legal minimum marriage age of 20&#x000a0;years. The boy and girl meet each other briefly, and the girl goes to stay at the boy&#x02019;s house. They are then accepted as a formally married couple. One of the local community health workers said:<disp-quote><p id="Par33">
<italic>The national government introduced the Child Marriage Act. According to this, no one should marry before [age] 20. However, this doesn't work here.

To settle a home, young girls get pregnant and bear children frequently, particularly those who experience baby losses.

Within five years of marriage, she is now pregnant with her fourth child.<disp-quote><p id="Par40">

It takes as long as three to six hours to return home after collecting firewood, fodder or grass from the forest, which are routine jobs for women without exemption, even during the last weeks of pregnancy.

Such a perception of pollution and giving birth in <italic>Gotha</italic> is considered culturally safe in the villages at a time when policies discuss the need for skilled attendance and institutional births as strategies to address poor quality of care and high perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. <italic>Gotha</italic> refers to the ground floor of a house where the family keeps cattle, goats, sheep and chicken. If the Gotha has any spare space, they also store firewood, grass and fodder. Women give birth in a corner of the <italic>Gotha</italic>, usually a short distance from the cattle. Some houses have a separate room on the ground floor, which they normally use for storing grass and firewood for the rainy season. It normally has only one entrance, little ventilation, and often no doors. The floor is usually damp and rough, and very cold in winter. Women give birth on old and worn-out dirty rugs, or they use dry straw on the floor.</p><p id="Par88">In the study villages, a birthing woman is traditionally considered untouchable <italic>(Chhuhi)</italic> and left to give birth alone. Attendants, including family members, feel hesitant to touch a birthing woman and her baby. A mother who lost two babies soon after birth, described:<disp-quote><p id="Par89">
<italic>Both times, I gave birth alone [in Gotha]. The first time, my sister-in-law witnessed, but she didn't touch me. She is a faith healer (Dhami); she worships Dewata (God).

In the study communities a woman who bears a boy is considered less polluted and can enter the home as early as the sixth day to perform <italic>Chhaith</italic> &#x02013; a ritual performed usually on the sixth day after birth. It is a common belief among the Hindus that the Goddess Saraswati (Goddess of wisdom) will visit the baby on this auspicious day and will create a destiny (a life script) for the baby&#x02019;s future. The ritual is observed by lighting an earthen lamp, putting a pen and paper at the baby&#x02019;s side and singing (traditional songs &#x02013; <italic>Bhajan</italic>) and dancing throughout the evening and the night of the sixth day. However, the pollution period for a newborn girl <italic>(Chhoriko chhuhhi)</italic> is longer. In the study villages, <italic>Chhaith</italic> is celebrated only for a newborn boy and was considered to bring good luck to the baby. This is not performed for girls because families do not consider it worth spending money on observing <italic>Chhaith</italic> for girls. The naming ceremony is also performed only for the boys, varying between the ninth and eleventh day after birth; girls are simply named informally by the parents because a formal ceremony is not considered worthwhile for a girl.</p><p id="Par98">In addition to gendered constructions as discussed above, it was observed during the fieldwork that there exists a potential for negotiating the space for birthing outside the house (for example, in the community birthing centre) if the house is very small with no spare rooms for birthing and if even the <italic>Gotha</italic> is too small. Confinement in the <italic>Gotha</italic> was also influenced by the easier access of basic amenities such as water supply and toilets, which are located on the ground floor and women do not have to climb difficult (and unsafe) ladders if the basic amenities were located inside the house on the first floor. Such amenities are not necessarily available in the formal birthing centres.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par99">Gendered constructions of motherhood emerged as major factors which contribute to perpetuating the pattern of high perinatal death rates in these mountain villages.

Child marriages and son preference are common in many developing countries and a range of studies describe a high prevalence of child marriages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and son preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] in South Asia as socio-cultural factors contributing to poor maternal and child survival. In discussing son preference, other studies have described sex-selective abortions, neglect of women and girls, and discrimination against females by withholding care from newborn girls due to son preference, as commonly practised in South Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. In the villages in this study, similar beliefs and practices exist but in addition the construct of <italic>Gharbar</italic> &#x02018;settling a daughter down&#x02019; is a major driving factor which perpetuates a vicious cycle of early marriage, and early and repeated childbearing (often closely spaced) with the strong desire for a surviving baby boy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Vicious loop of repeated pregnancy and baby loss in the study villages</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2018_1776_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par101">The tradition of <italic>Gharbar</italic> described in this study is consistent with practices reported in India in studies describing the socio-cultural context of marriage survival and parenthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Having a child (motherhood) is compulsory in Indian societies, which is seen as a factor enhancing a woman&#x02019;s status, and cementing the bonds of marriage between spouses. Patel (2006) described how a childless woman feels anxious, has low self-esteem, becomes powerless and in most cases faces neglect and divorce. In this study, the drive towards adolescent girls&#x02019; settlement is also linked to similar pressures for early motherhood and bearing babies at a young age, and further pressures for immediate child bearing when a woman loses a baby and has no baby boy yet. Rather than just counting the babies&#x02019; deaths, it is more about repeated childbearing in the hope of having a surviving baby, and thereby settling in a <italic>Gharbar</italic> to secure the marriage and feel secure in the in-laws&#x02019; family.</p><p id="Par102">Likewise, the context of girl settlement in this study resembles the description by Ware [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] of the life cycle of a typical woman in many traditional societies. Ware described the importance of the adolescent stage of a girl in developing countries with respect to protecting virginity, entering the boy&#x02019;s family (through early marriage) to contribute to agriculture and household duties, and to bear children, preferably boys (sons) early so that she can feel secure in her present life and in older age. More than 35&#x000a0;years later, Ware&#x02019;s findings still hold true in the remote mountain villages of Nepal, and although Ware&#x02019;s description pertains to the quality of women&#x02019;s reproductive life in general, the present study from Nepal adds that it is crucial to bring about changes in the components of <italic>Gharbar</italic> if we are to address the continuing high levels of perinatal mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Pregnancy and childbirth in the intra-familial dynamics of relationships and power</title><p id="Par103">The study identified a gendered intra-familial context as a crucial factor shaping access to healthcare during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period for a daughter-in-law and her baby. The villages follow the extended family system with typically two generations comprising the father, mother and their married sons. In such families, the position of a daughter-in-law is part of a hierarchy-based complex triad of intra-familial relationship dynamics: the daughter-in-law herself, her husband and her mother-in-law (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Daughter-in-law in family dynamics of relationships and power</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2018_1776_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par104">In this study, the intra-familial gendered role construction is particularly responsible for not seeing pregnancy and childbirth as special events worthy of providing additional care. Firstly, these are viewed as a woman&#x02019;s duty, which should require no special exemption from work&#x02013; even heavy physical work, and secondly, a daughter in-law is at a double disadvantage (a woman suffering from another woman) due to the negative controlling role of the mother-in-law, often preventing access to even basic healthcare. All of these make young girls and their babies vulnerable to sickness and death. Birth preparedness, although discussed in policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], is practically non-existent in such a context. Besides finding ways to change the attitudes of mothers-in-law to be more supportive of their daughters, as has been achieved in some Indigenous cultures elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], finding socially acceptable ways for the community to encourage men&#x02019;s interest and involvement in pregnancy and childbirth should be given a strong priority for improving maternal and perinatal health; both of these have been achieved for Indigenous cultures elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><p id="Par105">In many South Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries, mothers-in-law are the power bearers in families to decide access to healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and this was no different in the present study. Previous studies from Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] described the crucial role of mothers-in-law in their daughters-in-laws&#x02019; pregnancy and childbirth. Kaphle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] described mostly positive roles of mothers-in-law in care and support during pregnancy and childbirth. It appears that Kaphle et al. did not identify tension between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law regarding accessing healthcare, as was found this in this study. Similar to Simkhada et al. (2010) and Shrestha et al. (2012), the present study noted that mothers-in-law are often seen in negative controller roles, often imposing their own experiences of pregnancy and childbirth on their daughters-in-law, however difficult those experiences might have been. It may be that in these communities, becoming a mother-in-law is the only chance a woman has to show her pride, status and power, and she does this also by reinforcing the status quo of how she has experienced her own pregnancies, births, and losses. At the same time, the prominent role of mothers-in-law in maintaining this hierarchy is perhaps not surprising among women who themselves were never treated equal to men or anyone in their family until they became a mother-in-law.</p><p id="Par106">None of the previous studies from Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] specifically has discussed men&#x02019;s role in pregnancy and childbirth. The present study confirms that husbands were rarely involved in matters related to pregnancy and childbirth, even though national and international policies such as ICPD recommend male participation in reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is known that in many developed countries, men&#x02019;s engagement in pregnancy and childbirth has been enhanced through parents&#x02019; group classes, and encouragement to stay together and support their partners during labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. As evident in WHO (2007), 95% of prospective fathers in England and Denmark in the mid-1990s were by the side of their wives during labour at the hospital. Developing countries, particularly their low socioeconomic areas are far behind developed countries in terms of male participation in supporting their pregnant and postnatal wives. In the study villages pregnancy and birth are strongly maintained as only women&#x02019;s business, and men who wanted to help were dissuaded from doing so for fears of social stigmatisation. Men in the study villages are not expected to stay at home during a woman&#x02019;s childbirth; neither are they allowed to stay with their wives if they deliver at a health facility, thus clearly distancing them from childbirth related matters. Men who listen to their wives are not considered &#x02018;good sons&#x02019; in their mother&#x02019;s eyes, and those providing care and support to their wives are often criticised in the communities as weak, or a &#x0201c;womanly man&#x0201d; <italic>(Joitingre).</italic> Therefore, such gendered status of men proves to be a barrier to engage them in pregnancy and childbirth related matters.</p><p id="Par107">On the other hand, in Asia and Africa, men&#x02019;s involvement in maternal and child health should be considered crucial for reducing maternal and infant mortality by adopting family planning practices and increasing women&#x02019;s access to healthcare during obstetric emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. However, in the present study, family planning would be seen to work counter to the cultural desire for a woman to bear a surviving child, preferably a son as quickly as possible. Besides a general reluctance to use contraceptives due to high infant mortality and desire for sons, it is speculated that the stronger aversion to vasectomy is also related to male identity <italic>(Purushatwa)</italic> which is mainly about proving a man&#x02019;s ability to father children. Men are considered to lose their male identity and become weak after having had a vasectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Childbirth as a polluted event: Birth in <italic>Gotha</italic> (cowshed), and giving birth alone</title><p id="Par108">Segregation or confinement during the postnatal period and considering childbirth as a form of pollution is noted in previous studies from India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], and in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Bandyopadhyay described that the confinement of mother and baby after childbirth is a cultural tradition in India, followed due to a belief that the placental/postnatal blood is impure. The birthing woman herself is believed to be in danger&#x02014;in an inauspicious period, and can infect/pollute others. Another reason for confinement is believed to be to isolate the baby from visitors to protect from infection. Confinement during menstruation and childbirth/postnatal period is considered as a form of temporary pollution, whereas the belief that lower caste people are not pure, particularly for holy rituals and should not touch a person belonging to an upper caste is described as a permanent form of pollution. Studies from Bangladesh describe the locals keeping both mother and baby strictly confined, generally for up to 9&#x000a0;days (which can sometimes go up to 40&#x000a0;days) in the place of birth is to protect the mother and baby from malicious spirits. Previous studies in Nepal describe childbirth pollution as ritual tradition followed by the locals that makes them feel culturally safe during and after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and a period during which the locals consider that it is essential to confine women to heal themselves, as they are perceived to have become weak after childbirth. These studies have ignored to look into the fact that such practices at the same time deny a woman and her baby access to even basic healthcare. The present study highlights the fact that due to the perception of birth as a polluted event, the occurrence of childbirth in the <italic>Gotha</italic> (cowshed) in the study villages is nowhere near the common international debate about &#x02018;home versus health facility births&#x02019; or &#x02018;unskilled (lay attendants) versus skilled attendants&#x02019;. The present study reveals that the practice of ritual pollution not only confines a woman and her baby in the <italic>Gotha</italic>, but also compels women to give birth unaided and isolated without letting others touch the delivering mother (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), both to protect others from pollution but also as a sign of strength for the woman to give birth alone. Perinatal deaths during this period of isolation are matters of low concern, and often rationalised as <italic>Lekhanta</italic> (destiny) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] The context created by the above beliefs and practices in these villages is therefore likely to be a social barrier to seeking healthcare and help maintain the high vulnerability of newborn babies to poor perinatal survival.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Perception of childbirth as a polluted event</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2018_1776_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par109">Medical evidence shows that the time around birth is the most critical time to save the lives of a large number of mothers and babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Nepal&#x02019;s health policies and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] encourage women to deliver in health facilities to avoid potential risks of infection and death, especially during obstetric emergencies. A skilled attendant at childbirth is considered essential even if it is a homebirth. Far from delivering in a health facility (birthing centre) with skilled birth attendants which the national health policies aim for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], the present study found that women end up delivering, not even in a clean place at their home, but they deliver alone and unaided in <italic>Gotha</italic> (cowshed), which for most purposes is hardly clean, safe and comfortable. Seeking healthcare at health facilities and being attended at delivery by skilled birth attendants are completely compromised during this &#x0201c;polluting&#x0201d; period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Implications of the study</title><p id="Par110">Findings of the present study show that recommending quick-fix medical solutions alone will not be sufficient to reduce stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates in remote Nepal. The context of poor perinatal survival is rather complex, and therefore, it is not enough just to introduce policies to get rid of adverse behaviours which have a very strong social and cultural basis. Policy makers and programme implementers must acknowledge and understand the power of this intra-familial context which has shaped women&#x02019;s pregnancy and childbirth experiences in the villages for ages. Understanding the intra-familial context is vital to leveraging the effectiveness of family and community based interventions. Engagement with family members, particularly mothers-in-law and husbands is an important part of community engagement strategies. Community based maternal and child health programmes should not just target pregnant women (the daughters-in-law). In addition, they should strongly engage mothers-in-law because disengaging mothers-in-law could be perceived as a challenge by them who fear the loss of their power, and which may ultimately make them further controlling and hostile towards their daughters-in-law. Likewise, keeping men disengaged from their wives&#x02019; pregnancy and childbirth would perpetuate a gender stereotype that pregnancy and childbirth are women&#x02019;s only matters. Ignoring the possibility of behaviour change among the mothers-in-law and husbands to play positive roles in pregnancy and childbirth of wives/daughters-in-law, any family and the community based intervention on maternal and newborn health, as suggested in a range of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] is much less likely to succeed.</p><p id="Par111">Ensuring men&#x02019;s involvement with their wives during labour, both at home birth and health facility births could be part of future interventions. Likewise, rather than focussing on current women&#x02019;s only groups, namely the &#x02018;Mothers Group&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], mixed sex groups could be beneficial to reduce gender stereotypes and to sensitise men in supporting pregnancy and childbirth. Such mixed-group approaches have not been tried before in the study area, or in Nepal as a whole. Therefore as a first step, it is recommended that policies and programmes are revisited such as mobilisation of only female health volunteers in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], and group based education to only pregnant women&#x02019;s groups. It appears that mobilising &#x02018;women&#x02019;s only groups&#x02019; in the long run have reinforced gendered stereotypes of pregnancy, childbirth and newborn care as women&#x02019;s only responsibilities.</p><p id="Par112">Maternal and newborn health policies and programmes should not only target in prescribing tablets&#x02014;the basic medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and treating mother and child complications once they are already sick. The complexity of socio-cultural contexts where these women live, work and experience their motherhood demands solutions beyond simple medical approach. The health systems, more specifically primary health care approach should be strongly oriented towards a social determinant of health approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] so that actions and approaches which emerge at grass roots could be helpful to change health promotive behaviours throughout pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. Local primary health care programmes should be strongly driven to prevent social determinants such as child marriages and son preference. Reducing poverty, empowering women, and access to quality education for girls are frequently referred as the most effective interventions to prevent child marriages and son preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Besides a long-term focus on women empowerment and education for girls, participatory interventions mobilising women&#x02019;s group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], and local stakeholders&#x02019; group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], which are proven intervention to tackle high perinatal mortality could be utilised to educate communities to prevent discriminatory norms and values about child marriage and son preference, and thereby break the motive of <italic>Gharbar</italic> to prevent the vicious loop of ongoing perinatal deaths in the mountain villages. Inter-sectoral efforts at different settings (schools, health facilities, parent groups, faith/religious groups) may be useful to break the notion of the <italic>Gharbar</italic> (girl settlement) that perpetuates the loop of child marriages, early and repeated pregnancies, and persistent perinatal deaths in the villages. It is this construct of girl settlement backed up by the discriminatory norms and values that makes it so powerful that child marriages and son preferences continue in the villages despite legal measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. It has contributed to the persistence of vulnerabilities to perinatal deaths, has let this vulnerability remain unchecked, such as in the villages by not registering any marriages, births and deaths before they reach legal age. Making every death count and visible is one of the strategic actions strongly emphasised in maternal and neonatal health policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. However, policy or legislative changes alone appeared less impactful unless changes are brought from within the communities themselves.</p><p id="Par113">Given the near impossibility of changing people&#x02019;s mindset about birth pollution and delivering the baby away from the main living quarters of the house, funds should be directed towards creating more birthing centres and ensuring the deployment of trained female health workers in safe working conditions so that pregnant women are able to deliver in clean and safe conditions, attended by trained birth attendants. At the same time, intense and continuous behaviour change communications should be conducted to change the current mindset of mothers-in-law and the husbands and make them value each pregnancy and each child birth as very precious. Sympathetic religious leaders who outrank local faith healers should be called upon to visit these villages from time to time to talk to the villagers (especially the mothers-in-law) to change their current mindset. Above all, education (through informal means if necessary) should be imparted to all, so that people can understand that they can change their <italic>Bhagya (Fate)</italic> and <italic>Lekhanta (Destiny)</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="Par114">The qualitative methodology of this study confines us to elucidate gender related cultural contexts in the isolated mountain villages of Nepal.

This study argues that poor perinatal survival in developing countries such as Nepal cannot be understood without understanding gendered constructions along the pre-pregnancy, postnatal continuum from being a girl <italic>(Gharbar),</italic> a pregnant mother (daughter-in-law), and a woman and baby at and after birth (ritual pollution). Perinatal survival should be seen as a &#x02018;social construction of gender&#x02019;, thus not just limiting it to an indicator of quality of medical care, which predominantly values a medical construction and hence medical intervention. Only then, can we see the complex gendered contexts reflected in service planning and programme implementation. This will also facilitate the formulation and implementation of appropriate policies, thus moving away from merely acknowledging gender equality on paper, and from the study of mere distribution of sickness and death by sex in national reports.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
