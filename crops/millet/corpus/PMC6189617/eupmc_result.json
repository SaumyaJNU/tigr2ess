    "This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of gamma irradiation at dose levels of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 kGy on fungal growth, free fatty acids, in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), protein solubility, and functional properties of sorghum grains. Results indicated that radiation process enhanced the storability properties. It eliminates the fungal incidence particularly at the higher doses 4.0 and 5.0 kGy, and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the content of the free fatty acids to the level 3.4-3.2 mg/g. Moreover, a significant increase in IVPD and soluble protein was noticed in irradiated grains as compared to non-irradiated sample and this increased with the increase in dose; however, maximum IVPD (17.6%) and protein solubility (11.7%) were observed in sorghum grains irradiated at 2.0 kGy. On the other hand, a significant reduction in emulsion capacity was observed after radiation of grains, however, the emulsion activity and stability were stable up to 1.0 kGy. The foaming properties of the radiated sample show no significant change particular at low doses up to 2.0 kGy when they are compared to untreated samples. It can be concluded that low doses of gamma irradiation might improve the storability and quality characteristics of sorghum grains and can be used as an effective alternative postharvest method for preserving and extending the shelf life of sorghum and its products."
