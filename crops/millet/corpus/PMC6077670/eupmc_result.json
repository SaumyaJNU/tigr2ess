    "To determine the prevalence and determinants of blood haemoglobin level and mild, moderate, and severe anemia in a sample of adults from rural Tamil Nadu, India.We recruited a sample of men and nonpregnant women aged 20 years and older. Clinical health measures included blood haemoglobin concentration and body mass index. We assessed associations between anemia outcomes and sociodemographic and dietary factors using linear and logistic regression modeling.A total of 753 individuals (412 women and 341 men) participated in this study. The prevalence of anemia was 57.2% among women and 39.3% among men (P<0.001). Prevalence of anemia increased with age among men (P<0.001) but not women (P>0.05). Iron intake was low; 11.7% women and 24.1% of men reported iron intakes above recommended dietary allowances (P<0.001). Factors (OR (95% CI)) associated with mild or moderate anemia among women included television ownership (0.27 (0.13, 0.58)), livestock ownership (0.46 (0.28, 0.75)), refined grain consumption (1.32 (1.02, 1.72)), meat consumption (0.84 (0.71, 0.99)), and commercial agriculture production (mild: 4.6 (1.1, 18.8); moderate: 6.8 (1.98, 23.1)). Factors associated with mild, moderate, or severe anemia among men included rurality (0.50 (0.25, 0.99)), sugar consumption (1.04 (1.01, 1.06)), egg consumption (0.80 (0.65, 0.99)), and high caste (7.3 (1.02, 52.3)).Both women and men in this region may be particularly vulnerable to anemia, and future research must expand beyond dietary risk factors to examine the impacts of sociodemographic and environmental factors."
