Since these groups are present in <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> trophozoites, in this work we evaluated the anti-giardial activity of AGE and several garlic's TACs. <italic>In vitro</italic> susceptibility assays showed that AGE affected trophozoite viability initially by a mechanism impairing cell integrity and oxidoreductase activities while diesterase activities were abrogated at higher AGE concentrations. The giardicidal activities of seven TACs were related to the molecular descriptor HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy and with their capacity to modify the &#x02013;SH groups exposed in giardial proteins. Interestingly, the activity of several cysteine proteases in trophozoite lysates was inhibited by representative TACs as well as the cytopathic effect of the virulence factor giardipain-1. Of these, allicin showed the highest anti-giardial activity, the lower HOMO value, the highest thiol-modifying activity and the greatest inhibition of cysteine proteases. Allicin had a cytolytic mechanism in trophozoites with subsequent impairment of diesterase and oxidoreductase activities in a similar way to AGE. In addition, by electron microscopy a marked destruction of plasma membrane and endomembranes was observed in allicin-treated trophozoites while cytoskeletal elements were not affected. In further flow cytometry analyses pro-apoptotic effects of allicin concomitant to partial cell cycle arrest at G2 phase with the absence of oxidative stress were observed. In experimental infections of gerbils, the intragastric administration of AGE or allicin decreased parasite numbers and eliminated trophozoites in experimentally infected animals, respectively. These data suggest a potential use of TACs from garlic against <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> and in the treatment of giardiasis along with their additional benefits in the host's health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic></kwd><kwd>trophozoite damage</kwd><kwd>garlic</kwd><kwd>thioallyl compounds</kwd><kwd>allicin</kwd><kwd>giardiasis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003141</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">128426</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="12173"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Giardiasis is the intestinal parasitosis of highest incidence in developed countries with a global distribution of 280 million cases per year. Nearly 200 million people with symptomatic infections have been reported in Asia, Africa and Latin America where some 500,000 new cases per year are reported (Adam, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Lane and Lloyd, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; WHO, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Infection initiates when a vertebrate host consumes water or food containing infective cysts of <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> (syn. <italic>Giardia lamblia, Giardia intestinalis</italic>) and in the acidic gastric environment excystation is induced releasing excyzoites that divide to form trophozoites. These latter adhere to duodenum and jejunum epithelia triggering the pathogenic onset associated to giardiasis. At jejunum-ileum lumen trophozoites are exposed to high bile and low cholesterol concentrations at a slightly alkaline pH conditions that induce encystation. Cysts are shed in feces where they mature and remain viable for long periods of time until these are ingested by a new host. This infection may be symptomatic with acute signals characterized by diarrhea and abdominal complaints that may lead to malabsorption syndrome eventually associated to chronic outcomes. However, asymptomatic carriers have been found as a major group in hyperendemic areas (Redlinger et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).</p><p>The main strategy for the control of infections caused by <italic>G. duodenalis</italic>, comprises the use of a variety of antimicrobial drugs including acridines, (quinacrine), aminoglycosides (paromomycin) and most commonly drugs uses are 5-nitroheterocyclic compounds [metronidazole (MTZ), furazolidone, and nitazoxanide] and benzimidazoles [albendazole (ABZ) and mebendazole]. Most of these drugs have mild-to-severe secondary effects (revised by Gardner and Hill, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Further, the use of sublethal concentrations of antigiardial drugs <italic>in vitro</italic> or suboptimal therapy regimes, which include single-dose regimes of benzimidazoles given in communitarian programs to deworm children in endemic localities, may derive into selection of drug resistant parasites and increased incidences of giardiasis (Northrop-Clewes et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Thereby a better knowledge of therapeutic targets in <italic>Giardia</italic> is needed to develop more effective drugs for the treatment of giardiasis. In this context, compounds derived from natural products such as garlic (<italic>Allium sativum</italic> L.), may be considered as promising and alternative perspective for treatment of giardiasis (Anthony et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Garlic, a perennial crop common in the human diet, has been used since ancient times in folk medicine of different cultures as a panacea. Likewise aqueous and oil extracts of garlic bulbs provide benefits in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including carcinogenesis and some infections (Ankri and Mirelman, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Anthony et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Bhagyalakshmi et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), however the basis of its effectiveness have not yet been completely unraveled. In this context, there are reports on the anti-tumoral activities of a number of organosulfur compounds contained or derived from garlic. This is most likely due to the modulatory activity of these compounds on carcinogen metabolizing enzymes combined with the pro-apoptotic, antioxidant and radical scavenging properties (Milner, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Yang et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; De Gianni and Fimognari, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Also, garlic compounds were reported to have a direct activity against bacterial, protozoan, fungal and viral pathogens (reviewed by Bhagyalakshmi et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Although this broad antimicrobial activity is not readily explained by the aforementioned activities, there is accumulating evidence that organosulfur compounds are able to interact with highly reactive or unshielded thiol moieties of target proteins or aminoacids (e.g., enzymes or cysteine, respectively) forming the corresponding thioallyl adducts (R-SCH<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>2</sub>), an event potentially life threatening for the cell. Components from garlic that may be involved on these thiol-disulphide exchange reactions are the thioallyl compounds (TACs) that include S-allyl cysteine (obtained by long-time organic fermentation of whole bulbs in ethanolic solutions), allyl thiosulfinates (e.g., allicin, obtained by crushing o macerating bulbs in water) and some products of allicin decomposition (allyl sulfides and ajoenes) (Lawson and Wang, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Rabinkov et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Gallwitz et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Gupta and Porter, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Pinto et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Garlic has been shown to have an effect in children suffering from giardiasis when used at 1:20 dilutions of aqueous extract in 2 doses per day for 3 days (Soffar and Mokhtar, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that whole garlic extract and allyl alcohol have an effect on the physiology of <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites. These include cell surface rigidity, adhesion, flagellar activity, cytoskeletal components, and endomembrane elements (vesicles and vacuoles) while allyl mercaptan (AM, a TAC) preferentially induced vesicle distension and cell swelling, possibly related to a primary effect on membrane osmoregulation (Harris et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Based on these observations it is likely that several garlic components do have different electivity in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites, however the mechanisms involved in their giardicidal activity are still undefined. Although this microaerophilic protozoan is devoid of glutathione as major non-protein thiol, <italic>Giardia</italic> possesses a plethora of cysteine-rich surface proteins, cysteine-type proteinases and other sulfur-containing intracellular proteins (Ali and Nozaki, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) that may be targets of TACs. In this work, we carried out an analysis on the structure-activity relationship (SAR), mode of action and efficacy in experimental giardiasis of representative TACs from garlic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Parasites</title><p><italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites from the WB strain (ATCC # 30957) were axenically cultured in modified Diamond's TYI-S-33 medium (Keister, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>) without bile at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell harvests were carried out by chilling flasks at the log phase of growth reached after 72&#x02013;96 h routine subcultures. Detached trophozoites were either directly counted in a haemocytometer or washed 3 times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) prior to counting and the cell number was adjusted as required in the assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Garlic extracts and compounds</title><p>Fresh, aqueous garlic extract (AGE) was prepared by crushing peeled, chopped and weighed garlic bulbs (<italic>A. sativum</italic> L.) in distilled water (0.1 g/mL) at pH 6.5 using a mortar. After resting for 10 min, homogenate was filtered through a 0.45 &#x003bc;M pore size Millipore<sup>TM</sup> membrane. The filtrate was recovered and used at the required concentrations. Regarding the garlic components the following compounds were used: alliin (S-allyl cysteine sulphoxide, ALI), diallyl sulfide (DAS) and dipropyl sulfide (DPS) from Fluka Chemika AG (Buchs, Switzerland); diallyl disulphide (DADS), dipropyl disulphide (DPDS), allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) and allyl mercaptan (AM) from Aldrich Chem. Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA); methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) and sodium p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (pHMB) from Sigma Chem. Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA); S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) from TCI (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) from MP Biomedicals Inc. (Solon, OH, USA). Allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate, ALC) was obtained by oxidation of DADS using the protocol originally reported by Lawson (Lawson, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In this, 1 g DADS was dissolved in 5 mL acetic acid under stirring on an ice bath. Hydrogen peroxide (1.5 mL, 30% v/v) was added stepwise and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. Then, the reaction was kept at 13&#x000b0;C for 20 min then it was placed on an ice bath for 5 h to minimize the content of remaining DADS. Reaction was stopped by adding 15 mL distilled water at pH 6.5 and it was extracted with 30 mL dichloromethane. Acetic acid was removed by 5 extractions with 5% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (20 mL each) then by 3 extractions with distilled water (20 mL each). The solvent was left to evaporate until yellowish oil (ALC, yield of ~600&#x02013;800 &#x003bc;L per assay) was obtained. For stabilization and storage of ALC, the oily product was resuspended in water at 1.5% (w/v) and kept in 1 mL aliquots at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until analyzed and used. Under these conditions, ALC retained its full activity for up to 6 months. The identification of ALC was performed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (<sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>1</sup>H-spectra) using a Jeol Eclipse<sup>TM</sup> spectrometer with deuterated carbon trichloride (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) as solvent and tetramethylsilane as reference solution. Chemical shifts were recorded in ppm at 300 MHz in a Brucker system. Purity of ALC was determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (Waters model 996 coupled to a pump Waters model 600) using 4.6 &#x000d7; 250 mm Spherisorb<sup>TM</sup> columns (10 &#x003bc;M particle size), mobile phase 30% methanol:70% water, flow rate 0.4 mL/min and UV detection at 254 nm, rendering an average time retention of 3.61 min and a mean purity of 90&#x02013;92% for synthetic allicin.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> susceptibility assays</title><p>When complete TYI-S-33 medium (final cysteine concentration = 12.4 mM) was used, it was no older than 10 days to avoid cysteine oxidation. In these assays, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> trophozoites were exposed to increasing concentrations of AGE or TACs for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C in 4.5 mL screw-capped vials. Positive controls included trophozoites treated with metronidazole at 3.0 and 5.9 &#x003bc;M (corresponding to its IC<sub>50</sub> and MLC; Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and as a negative control for the vehicle, 20 &#x003bc;L distilled water, pH 6.5 were included in all experiments to discard significant variabilities in standard drug susceptibility of the WB strain used in this study. Parasites were harvested and counted and trophozoite's viability was determined by physiological methods to determine the growth capacity of trophozoites after drug exposure (subculture in liquid medium SCLM)] or trophozoite and membrane integrity [direct cell count (DCC) and trypan blue exclusion (TBE), respectively]. Also, enzyme activity&#x02013;based methods were used and these included fluorescein diacetate-propidium iodide staining (FDA-PI) that relies on the ability of cellular esterases in living cells to hydrolyse FDA into fluorescein while PI form complexes with nucleic acids of dead cells (Breeuwer et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>); the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay that is based on the crystallyzation of the formazan derivative of MTT in living cells by the action of cellular oxidoreductases (NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases, reductases) (Liu et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). All these protocols have been described elsewhere (Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) except that DCC values were calculated from total cell numbers of compound-exposed trophozoites divided by the initial trophozoites' inoculum (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) and TBE was performed by incubating PBS-washed parasites in a trypan blue solution (0.4% [w/v] final concentration) for 5 min at room temperature followed by microscopic count of &#x0201c;stained&#x0201d; (non-viable) parasites. As reference, the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; method (SCLM) consisted in the back growth of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> parasites for 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C after exposure to compounds and the interpolation of cell counts into a standard growth curve run in parallel using increasing number of parasites (5,000&#x02013;250,000) non exposed to any drug.</p><p>In each method, the inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) and the minimal lethal concentration (MLC) corresponding to the lower concentration of compound that caused mortality in all cells were calculated using the concentration-viability curves in which the minimal-square method was used. Statistical significance between the data obtained in two or more experiments was determined by paired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-Student's test (Microsoft Excel<sup>TM</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy studies</title><p>Trophozoites were exposed to TACs in two ways: under long (24 h, standard toxicity) and short (3 h, acute toxicity) incubations at 37&#x000b0;C using concentrations corresponding to the experimental MLC (as determined at 24 h) and twofold the MLC, respectively. For scanning electron microscopy, PBS-washed parasites were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, dehydrated under increasing concentrations of ethanol, critical-point dried using a Samdri apparatus, gold coated in an ion sputtering device (JEOL-JFC-1100), and examined with a JEOL 35-C scanning electron microscope. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, washed cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer. Following sequential dehydration in ethanol, samples were embedded with epoxy resins. Thin sections were observed in a JEOL 100-SX transmission electron microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>SAR analyses</title><p>The values of four electronic and two molecular transport (absorption prediction) descriptors have been previously determined for most TAC used herein (see Table 2 in Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Briefly, the chemical structures of the ten compounds were constructed using Chemdraw Ultra 8.0 software (Cambridge soft Corp. Cambridge, MA, USA) and imported into SPARTAN'04 package (Wave function Inc. Irvine, CA, USA). The <italic>ab initio</italic> approach was used in this software to minimize structures and obtain equilibrium geometry <italic>in vacuo</italic> using the semi-empirical AM1 module. Thus, the minimal energy conformations (Boltzmann conformers) of each compound were obtained by default parameters in order to determine values for electronic properties that included HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>HOMO</italic></sub>) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>LUMO</italic></sub>) eigen values, dipole moment (Debye) and total energy (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>TOTAL</italic></sub>). Regarding the two descriptors related to absorption prediction, the octanol/water partition coefficient (<italic>log P</italic><sub><italic>oct</italic></sub>) values were retrieved from other studies while the molecular polar surface area (<italic>PSA</italic>) was calculated following the fragment-based contribution procedure. The relationship between the values of each of these molecular descriptors and the giardicidal activity (expressed as MLC values) were determined by multiple regression analysis (MLR) using the 16.0.18 version of Statgraphics Centurion XVI software.</p></sec><sec><title>Thiol-modifying activity of TACs</title><p>The technique reported by Lawson and Wang (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) was followed. In these assays trophozoites were collected from 60 mL flasks, washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended in 500 &#x003bc;L PBS containing a 1:12.5 dilution of a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete<sup>TM</sup>, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and lysed by sonication at 12 microns/60% amplitude (Ultrasonic apparatus Sonic UVX1130PB). Soluble proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 15,400 &#x000d7; g for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford technique. These samples were adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/mL.

These TACs have defined modifications in their chemical structure mainly involving increasing hydrocarbon chains with carbon-carbon double bonds and additions of sulfur and/or oxygen atoms or even &#x003b1;-aminoacidic groups thus rendering AM as the simplest and SAC as the most complex TAC evaluated herein. As shown in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> the thioallyl group displayed in bold in each chemical formula and comparing experimental MLC values, the giardicidal efficacy of AM was drastically lowered (3.06 vs. 74.28 mM) by replacing the sulfur-attached Hydrogen by a methyl group as in AMS; however the replacement of this Hydrogen by an allyl group as in DAS partially recovers the efficacy in one order of magnitude (23.71 mM) below to that of AM. Interestingly the further addition of a second sulfur atom, as in DADS, recovers fully the efficacy to a comparable level of that displayed by AM (2.66 mM). Further the addition of a sulfur-attached oxygen atom, as displayed in ALC increased the giardicidal activity to sub-milimolar concentrations (0.6 mM) being ALC (allicin or diallyl thiosulfinate) the most effective TACs tested. In contrast, the presence of one &#x003b1;-amino carboxylic group (cysteine) in SAC decreased the efficacy of TACs to similar levels as that of AMS (69.1 vs. 74.28 mM).

Zymogram analysis showed that lysates displayed several bands of proteolysis (mostly between 25 and 110 kDa; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) of which bands of 75, 60, and 25 kDa were the most prominent. Some of these activities (110, 60, 75, and 25 kDa) were strongly inhibited by 3.5 mM ALC while DADS at a much higher concentration (275 mM) could diminish similar activities except for the one at 60 kDa. Intriguingly AM produced a significant increase of activity in bands of 75, 60, and 25 kDa though this might reflect its lack of reactivity toward protein &#x02013;SH groups and its &#x0201c;cooperative&#x0201d; activity with DTT. As expected, a full inhibition of all proteolytic bands was observed with the unspecific thiol-active inhibitor pHMB at 10 mM. On the other hand the typical cathepsin B protease inhibitor E64 displayed a selective inhibition on the 25 kDa band that contains the processed form of the cathepsin B-like protease named as giardipain-1 (Ortega-Pierres et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). By molecular modeling and docking approaches, the higher inhibitory activity of ALC toward proteases like giardipain-1 could be at least partially explained by the predicted ability of its Oxygen atom to form an electron bridge with the Hydrogen G3 of the catalytic Cys26 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) thereby interfering with protease activity. This is reinforced by the similar entropy values predicted for these TACs (&#x00394;G<sub>ALC</sub> = &#x02212;5.561 kCal/mol; &#x00394;G<sub>DADS</sub> = &#x02212;6.093 kCal/mol; &#x00394;G<sub>AM</sub> = &#x02212;5.554 kCal/Mol).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, giardipain-1 causes a strong destruction of monolayers beginning with cell shrinkage and profuse blebbing (arrows) and the subsequent appearance of zones with absence of cells reflecting extensive destruction (asterisks) that are consistent with the pro-apoptotic damage reported for this secreted cysteine protease (Ortega-Pierres et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, the pre-incubation of giardipain-1 with ALC and AM noticeably blocked these effects while DADS reduced the frequency of cells displaying apoptotic damage. In general, these observations support a correlation between the inhibitory ability of garlic TACs on the proteolytic activity of giardipain-1 and the damage blockade exerted by these compounds. As expected, the potent cathepsin B inhibitor E64 efficiently inhibited the giardipain-1 induced damage in IEC6 cell monolayers. Of interest, with the exception of DADS concentration used in zymography analyses (275 mM) that affected some cells, none concentrations of TACs tested either at protease-inhibiting level or at MLCs that kill trophozoites in culture, were harmful to cell monolayers (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>).

In these assays, the TBE protocol was also included in order to assess whether the integrity of trophozoite's membrane is primarily targeted by ALC. As expected, SCLM was the most sensitive method where cell viability completely decreased at concentrations below 0.8 mM ALC while all other methods still displayed viability rates of &#x0003e;20% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Thus parasite replication was initially suppressed at 600 &#x003bc;M ALC; the other two physiological methods (DCC and TBE) showed a concomitant decrease of viability (1.08 and 1.12 mM, respectively) and the two enzyme-based assays (FDA-PI and MTT) showed the lowest sensitivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), suggesting that ALC primarily affected the cellular replication by impairing membrane permeability hence cellular integrity, with a secondary effect on the activity of metabolic enzymes as oxidoreductases and diesterases.

Regardless of the standard or acute toxicity protocols, ALC treatment leads to a complete loss of electron density of the intracellular elements and the integrity of plasma membrane, a diffuse destruction of cytoplasmic content rendering a granulose appearance and even nuclear envelopes seemed to be compromised (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B-2,4</xref>). In this context, a profuse condensation of chromatin at the inner periphery was seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B-4</xref>). As a consequence, a profuse vacuolisation pattern that occurs frequently with antigiardial drugs was not observed with ALC. Under these conditions, all cytoskeletal elements at ventral disk, cell periphery and flagella remained structurally unaltered and also cell shrinkage was not observed by SEM. These observations reinforced the presence of a cytolytic effect of ALC on <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites that promoted alterations at cellular (and even nuclear) membrane(s)'s integrity associated to further destruction of intracellular structures. To gain more insights on the ALC-mediated damage, we tested whether programmed cell death, oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest could be induced by ALC and then we compared these data with those obtained using ABZ which effects under similar conditions have been already described (Mart&#x000ed;nez-Espinosa et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pro-apoptotic, non-prooxidant and G2-arresting effect of allicin on trophozoites</title><p>Based on the fact that ALC caused cytolysis in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites, it was of interest to determine the way by which parasites were killed by this TAC.

In spite that ALC is a major thiosulfinate in garlic extracts (Lawson, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) these differences are likely attributed to a distinct availability of ALC at intestinal lumen of infected animals to reach its targets in resident trophozoites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Garlic has widely proven to be a rich source of nutraceutical compounds (Bhagyalakshmi et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) that are mostly organosulfur compounds as TACs. Indeed, garlic's TACs have a double benefit, i.e., health promoting and illness fighting, upon dietary or supplementary consumption. In recent years TACs contained in aqueous (e.g., ALC), ethanol (e.g., SAC) or oily (e.g., allyl sulfides as DATS, DADS, DAS, AMS, AM) garlic extracts have been studied in relation to the treatment of infectious diseases because of their direct effects over a plethora of pathogens (Ankri and Mirelman, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; D'Souza et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In this work, the seven TACs mentioned above were evaluated in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites regarding its cytotoxic mechanism and therapeutic potential in experimental giardiasis.</p><p>Our results showed that the AGE's MLC as determined in this work (425 &#x000b1; 47 &#x003bc;g/mL) is slightly higher than the value of 300 &#x003bc;g/mL previously determined (Harris et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the use of two parasite strains (WB vs. Portland-1) along to different garlic sources (fresh cloves macerated in water vs. freeze-dried powder vortexed in culture medium) may account for the differences obtained in both studies. In addition, values of MLCs of four similar TACs used in our study and in another work (AM, AMS, DAS, and DADS) differed quantitatively, albeit AM and DADS were in both cases more active against trophozoites than either DAS or AMS. When its effect was compared to the one observed against other pathogens, AGE had a lower effectivity against enteral bacteria e.g., <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (MLC: from 5 to 25&#x02013;400 mg/mL) (Cellini et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Moghadam et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) or even anaerobic protozoa as <italic>Trichomonas gallinae</italic> (MLC: 75 mg/mL) (Seddiek et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) thus highlighting the importance of the conspicuous repertoire of thiol-containing proteins and the dependence on cysteine import and metabolism in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> (Ali and Nozaki, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) concomitant to its higher susceptibility to garlic constituents.</p><p>The use of physiological and enzyme activity based protocols were useful to determine that AGE had a cytolytic mechanism (i.e., TBE and DCC assays displayed high sensitivity) concomitant to an impaired oxidoreductase capacity as assessed by MTT assays and a further impairment of diesterase activity in trophozoites as shown by the lower sensitivity of FDA-PI assays. The effect of garlic components on the integrity of cell membranes were in agreement with a previous report (Harris et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) that showed a collapse in the electrochemical potential of trophozoite plasma membranes exposed to AGE and allyl alcohol. In this context, the abundance of cysteine (i.e., thiol)-rich proteins in <italic>Giardia</italic> surface proteins (Adam, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Pinto et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ali and Nozaki, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) play a direct role as primary targets of garlic constituents, especially organosulfur compounds as TACs. Likewise, it is possible that some enzymes having a rate-limiting role in glucose metabolism of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> and harboring cysteine residues critical for activity modulation (e.g., triosephosphate isomerase) (Reyes-Vivas et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) are also affected by garlic components. Further assays using recombinant or purified target molecules may be useful to provide more data on the effects of garlic components on <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites.</p><p>The relation between TAC structure and giardicidal activity showed that the increasing numbers of sulfur atoms are important for this effect and remarkably, points out that the presence of the sulfur-attached oxygen atom in ALC accounts for its maximal efficacy. When comparing the relative giardicidal activity of these seven TACs(ALC&#x0003e;DATS&#x0003e;DADS&#x0003e;AM&#x0003e;DAS&#x0003e;SAC&#x0003e;AMS) with its HOCl-scavenging capacity (SAC&#x0003e;DATS&#x0003e;DAS&#x0003e;ALC&#x0003e;DAS&#x0003e;AM&#x0003e;AMS; Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) it was observed that garlic's TACs have a wide biological mechanisms suggesting that there is a need to choose the best compound for a defined benefit, either therapeutic (e.g., anticancer and antimicrobial) or antioxidant that will finally induce health-promoting activities upon consumption (Capasso, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As examples, AMS could provide low beneficial effects whereas DATS (sell as Dasuansu in China) could give multiple benefits while ALC could also provide several benefits but with a higher efficacy as antimicrobial agent. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to compare these TACs in other systems to obtain compelling data on the effects of TACs. In addition, the molecular descriptor <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>HOMO</italic></sub> was useful to predict the antigiardial effect of TACs and interestingly it was a partial contributor for HOCl-scavenging activities of these TACs (Arg&#x000fc;ello-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Considering that HOMO are electron orbitals that could act as electron donors and LUMO are electron acceptor orbitals in a given molecule, these data suggest that ALC exhibiting the highest <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>HOMO</italic></sub> value (&#x02212;211.71 kcal/mol) is a strong electron donor that could hence act as a nucleophile toward parasite's molecules bearing electron-acceptor groups e.g., thiols (R-SH) at a greater extent as compared with all other TACs used leading to trophozoite death.</p><p>There is a growing body of information regarding the efficacy of ALC against other protozoan pathogens. For example, in the human intestinal parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> the reported IC<sub>60</sub> (500 &#x003bc;M; Ankri et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) is similar to the IC<sub>50</sub> value obtained for <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> in this work using the same assay (686 &#x003bc;M) again reflecting the cysteine-rich content and thiol&#x02013;dependent metabolism of these mitosome-containing parasites (Ali and Nozaki, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In the also diplomonad but aerotolerant, hydrogenosome-containing fish parasite <italic>Spironucleus vortens</italic> ALC has a higher IC<sub>50</sub> value (&#x0003e;1.12 mM; Millet et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) that is likely linked to a lower susceptibility of its glutathione-based metabolism (Williams et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to this TAC. In contrast, the small intestinal chicken parasite <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic> displays a poor susceptibility to ALC (IC<sub>99</sub> = 11.1 mM; Alnassan et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) due at least in part to its diverse metabolism highlighted by several shunt-off pathways like the mannitol cycle (Schmatz, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p>As far as the mechanism of cytotoxic action of ALC is concerned, its cytolytic, membrane-damaging effects were evidenced by the higher sensitivity of physiological methods (DCC and TBE) and electron microscopy analyses. In contrast with AGE, the MTT reduction assay displayed the lowest sensitivity of all methods used, suggesting that cellular oxidoreductases are not primary targets of ALC. Although ALC behaved as AGE did against trophozoite's integrity, it had a thiol-disulfide exchange capacity that correlated to and accounted for its highest giardicidal efficacy as compared to all other TACs tested. Therefore, the derivatizing reaction mediated by TACs on giardial proteins exposing thiol-groups to form S-allylmerecpto adducts (R-SH &#x02192; R-S-S-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH = CH<sub>2</sub>) was proven to be a major mechanism promoting trophozoite's death. However, this general reaction of ALC (Rabinkov et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) could take place at certain proteins that have important implications for cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic>. Among these are cysteine proteases that intrinsically have the catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn. These constitute a repertoire of around 10 proteins in this parasite, participate in host cell damage and are feasible candidates for new therapeutic strategies in giardiasis (DuBois et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ali and Nozaki, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ankarklev et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gargantini et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Cabrera-Licona et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Ortega-Pierres et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The zymogram anlaysis presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> indicates that garlic TACs are effectively inhibitors of several cysteine proteases in trophozoite lysates with ALC displaying a remarkably higher inhibitory action than DADS in good agreement with their thiol-modifying activities determined herein and in recent reports in other parasite models (Waag et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Of particular interest was the marked inhibition of the proteolytic activity of giardipain-1, a secreted virulence factor of <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites, observed with ALC, DADS, and E64 in zymograms, Giardipain-1 has recently been reported to exert pro-apoptotic effects in epithelial cells monolayers including membrane blebbing, external phosphatidylserine exposure, loss of barrier function, caspase 3 activation, and altered localization of tight junction proteins as occludin and claudin-1 (Ortega-Pierres et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Moreover, representative TACs as are ALC, DADS and AM were not only able to reduce the cytopathic effects of giardipain-1 but to display a much more marked effect in trophozoites' viability over epithelial cell integrity. These facts suggest that ALC is a promising candidate in further studies at preclinical level in giardiasis.</p><p>Other likely targets of ALC and remainder TACs in <italic>Giardia</italic> are the variable surface proteins (VSPs) that are a family with over 230 members having 10&#x02013;12% of cysteine residues in their sequence that are involved in antigenic variation and other functions, the high-cysteine membrane proteins (HCMp) family with role in epithelium-trophozoite interactions and cell differentiation along with the iron-sulfur cluster containing protein family (e.g., ferredoxins) involved in redox metabolism. Studies in our group on these interactions are now under progress.</p><p>At the level of cellular processes, ALC induced apoptotic-like cell death and arrest at G2 phase with thiol but not oxidative stress as shown by flow cytometry studies. When the effects of ABZ, a potent antigiardial agent currently prescribed, it was observed that ALC also promoted apoptosis-like death as many other antigiardial agents from synthetic or plant resources; nevertheless ALC did not cause ROS formation suggesting that TACs are not significantly metabolized by trophozoites unlike most of prescribed drugs as ABZ, MTZ, furazolidone or nitazoxanide (Gardner and Hill, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). On the other hand, the putative induction of thiol stress in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> trophozoites caused by ALC and other TACs by modification of thiol groups to S-allylmercapto adducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is similar to that reported in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; however, in these bacteria ALC induced oxidative stress as assessed by the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as OxyR, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and thioredoxins 1 and 2 (M&#x000fc;ller et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly ALC also induced oxidative stress with the same probe used here (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) in the mitochondria-containing protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> albeit the absence of phosphatidylserine externalization at cell membrane as assessed by annexin V and positive staining with PI indicated a necrotic process of cell death (Corral et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All these studies shed light on the multiplicity of microbicidal effects of ALC regardless of its well-recognized mode of action on cellular thiols.</p><p>In the experimental gerbil model of giardiasis ALC demonstrated a potential utility at single doses of 70 (5/6 gerbils cured) and 138 mg/kg (6/6 gerbils cured) while AGE was effective using two doses of 770 mg/kg (5/6 gerbils cured). In our experience ALC by intragastric route shows a lethal dose in gerbils of &#x0003e;400 mg/kg and in other rodents this TAC displays oral lethality at 300 mg/kg (mouse) and 980 mg/kg (rat). In spite of this apparently narrow margin of therapeutic security for ALC, in further studies splitting into two or more days the treatment could reduce these doses. Some encouraging examples on this regard have been reported with experimental infections of mice by systemic protozoa as <italic>Babesia microti</italic> where 30 mg/kg ALC orally for 5 days significantly reduced parasitemia and with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> in which 4 daily doses of ALC at either 9 mg/kg (orally) or 8 mg/kg (intravenously) markedly reduced mortality (Coppi et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Salama et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Concurrent to these purposes is the possibility to improve the bioavailability of ALC or AGE components at intestinal milieu using carriers such as nanoparticles (Pinilla et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Soumya et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the results obtained in this study highlight the cytolytic mechanism involved in the cytotoxic activity of AGE and particularly TACs as ALC that also produce thiol stress, apoptosis-like cell death as a consequence of targeting multiple proteins in <italic>G. duodenalis</italic> including cysteine proteinase activities as shown in this work. The identification and characterization of interactions of garlic components/derivatives with giardial biomolecules deserves future studies and indicates that ALC is a promising antigiardial agent with concomitant benefits for host health.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Comit&#x000e9; Interno para el Cuidado y Uso de los Animales de Laboratorio (CICUAL) Del Cinvestav, M&#x000e9;xico.
