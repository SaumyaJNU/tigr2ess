Over the past few decades, many <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in some plant species. However, genes belonging to the MYB superfamily in peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) have not been comprehensively identified and characterized although the genome sequences of peach were released several years ago. In total, this study yielded a set of 256 <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes that was divided into five subfamilies: the R2R3-MYB (2R-MYB), R1R2R3-MYB (3R-MYB), MYB-related (1R-MYB), 4R-MYB, and Atypical-MYB subfamilies. These subfamilies contained 128, 4, 109, 1, and 14 members, respectively. The 128 R2R3-MYB subfamily genes in peach were further clustered into 35 groups, and the 109 MYB-related subfamily genes were further clustered into 6 groups: the CCA1-like, CPC-like, TBP-like, I-box-binding-like, R-R-type, and Peach-specific groups. The motif compositions and exon/intron structures within each group within the R2R3-MYB or MYB-related subfamily in peach were highly conserved. The logo sequences of the R2 and R3 repeats of R2R3-MYB subfamily members were highly conserved with those in these repeats of several other plant species. Except for 48 novel peach-specific <italic>MYB</italic> genes, the remaining 208 out of 256 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in peach were conserved with the corresponding 198 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>. Additionally, the 256 <italic>MYB</italic> genes unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. Eighty-one orthologous pairs of peach/<italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana MYB</italic> genes were identified among 256 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in peach and 198 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> in this study. In addition, 146 pairs of paralogous <italic>MYB</italic> genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of peach. The expression levels of some of the 51 <italic>MYB</italic> genes selected for qRT-PCR analysis decreased or increased with red-fleshed fruit development, while the expression patterns of some genes followed no clear rules over the five developmental stages of fruits. This study laid the foundation for further functional analysis of <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes in peach and enriched the knowledge of <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes in plant species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7275-0893</contrib-id><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Mingliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>China Agriculture Research System</institution></funding-source><award-id>CARS-30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7275-0893</contrib-id><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Mingliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 31471848 to MY (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>) and the China Agriculture Research System, No. CARS-30 to MY (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://123.127.160.231/">http://123.127.160.231/</ext-link>).

Therefore, changes in the expression of TF genes can eventually lead to dramatic alterations in a plant [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. TFs are usually dispersed throughout the genome of a plant species. Thus, the recent shift from gene-centric to genome-centric approaches in biology is appreciated for exploring TFs [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The majority of TFs can be classified into different gene families according to the conserved domains that are shared by all the members within a given family and specifically bind to DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of downstream target genes [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among the various TF families in the genome, the MYB family is one of the largest and functionally diverse families [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, it is usually called the MYB superfamily. MYB superfamily proteins are characterized by having a highly conserved MYB domain at the N-terminus that is usually composed of 1&#x02013;4 adjacent imperfect tandem repeats (R1-R4) [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Each imperfect tandem repeat encodes 50&#x02013;53 amino acid residues and contains three &#x003b1;-helices, the second and third of which form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on the number of MYB imperfect tandem repeat (R), MYB superfamily members are classified into four subfamilies, namely, MYB-related proteins (or 1R-MYB proteins, having one R), R2R3-MYB proteins (having two Rs), R1R2R3-MYB proteins (having three Rs), and 4R-MYB proteins (having four Rs) [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The R1R2R3-MYB subfamily proteins are predominant in animals, but the R2R3-MYB subfamily proteins are the most prevalent in plants [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Based on their conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships, R2R3-MYB subfamily proteins have been classified into 30&#x02013;38 groups in plants [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As an increasing number of genome sequences have been released, a variety of MYB superfamily proteins have been identified and analyzed in a wide range of plant species such as sesame [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], <italic>Brassica napus</italic> (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>napus</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], kiwi [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], foxtail millet [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and pear [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, multiple MYB proteins in plants have been functionally studied in detail. The results from these studies have proved that they are involved in regulating a wide range of intricate networks, growth, development, and stress resistancethroughout the plant life cycle, including the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the coloration of fruit skin [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], flavonoid/phenylpropanoid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], secondary wall biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], sugar signaling [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and responses to drought and waterlogging stress [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) is an important horticultural fruit and a model plant of Rosaceae family with characteristics such as a short life cycle, the ability to self-pollinate and a small genome size of 265 Mb [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Peach is native to China. Although there is a wide range of cultivated peach cultivars in China, there is only four kinds of flesh color in general: white, green, yellow and red. In recent decades, red-fleshed peaches attracted a lot of attention from breeders and consumers worldwide, because of the exceptional colors and functional components enrichment. The molecular mechanisms underlying red-fleshed trait is still not clear in peach. It is highly important to explore genes involved in the regulation of red color formation in peach for accelerating the breeding progress of red-fleshed peach cultivars. In some fruit tree species, anthocyanin have been reported to involve in the formation of red flesh color, and <italic>MYB</italic> genes have been suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recently, whole genome sequences of peach were added to the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR), providing an important foundation for the genome-wide identification of genes of a given peach family [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Genes of the peach MYB superfamily have not been comprehensively identified and characterized. Thus, the identification and characterization of all <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes and their subfamily and group classification, motif and exon/intron composition, syntenic relationships, and expression levels were analyzed in this study. The findings of this study will be helpful for further functional studies of interesting <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes involved in fruit development in peach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The fruits from one-year-old fruiting shoots were selected as experimental materials from the outer southern canopies of six-year-old &#x02018;Zhaoxia&#x02019; (ZX, white flesh) and &#x02018;Yejihong&#x02019; (YJH, red flesh) peach trees grown under the same field conditions and standard management at the National Peach Germplasm Repository in Nanjing, China.

The TBP-like group, with 26 members, is the second largest of the six groups, and its members dispersed throughout the five clades around the circle of the phylogenetic tree. Almost all of the members of this group contain the same conserved motif.

On the one hand, the motif composition was the same for the members of each group (I-box-binding-like or R-R-type) but different between the I-box-binding-like and R-R-type groups. On the other hand, the lengths of the protein sequences within the I-box-binding-like group were all similar and relatively short, and the lengths of the protein sequences within the R-R-type group were similar but longer than those of all the members of the I-box-binding-like group. These features indirectly confirmed the correct classification for the 1R-MYB subfamily in peach.</p><p>Within the second phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g002">Fig 2</xref>), only one 4R-MYB protein (Prupe.8G098500.1) was identified in this study, the same number as in tomato [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], sweet orange [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], pear [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This finding is consistent with a previous report that found a single 4R-MYB protein encoded in several plant genomes [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

No MYB protein from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> was clustered with those 48 Peach-specific MYB proteins, which were located at the beginning of clade of the second phylogenetic tree. This result means that not all the identified peach MYB TFs had a corresponding representative gene in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> and suggested that these peach proteins might have fruit-related functions that were either not needed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> or were acquired after divergence from the last common ancestor.

These 83 R2R3-MYB protein sequences all had motif 3 (green), motif 4 (blue), motif 1 (red), and motif 2 (sky blue) in that order, containing 21, 11, 41, and 21 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199192.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199192.s006">S6</xref> Tables).

Slightly different from these 83 R2R3-MYB proteins, 9 of 128 R2R3-MYB protein sequences highly conserved motifs 3, 13, 1, and 2 in that order for most members of groups C29 to C31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199192.s005">S5 Table</xref>). As the logo composition shows (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199192.s006">S6 Table</xref>), motif 3, motif 13, and the front part of motif 1 were composed of the R2 repeat, and the back part of motif 1 and all of motif 2 were composed of the R3 repeat.

The residue compositions of logo sequences of R2 and R3 repeats agreed with those reported in other plant species such as soybean [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], sweet orange [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and kiwi [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports, most of the R2R3-MYB proteins included a highly conserved separated triplet of tryptophan (Trp, W) residues in the R2 repeat of peach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g004">Fig 4</xref>), which may form a tryptophan cluster in the three-dimensional HTH structure and play key roles in the aspect of MYB-DNA recognition [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Additionally, R2 and R3 repeats were characterized by highly conserved groups of glutamic acid (E)-glutamic acid (E)-aspartic acid (D) residues (EED) and glutamic acid (E)-glutamic acid (E)-glutamic acid (E) residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Four (ppa023926m, Prupe.3G219200.1, Prupe.2G307600.1, and Prupe.2G185200.1) of the six members of group C33 (ppa023926m, Prupe.3G219200.1, Prupe.2G307600.1, Prupe.2G185200.1, Prupe.6G349400.1, and Prupe.6G255800.1) had only the R2 repeat in their protein sequences. The motif 3 of Prupe.6G349400.1, which is a part of the R2 repeat, was located behind motif 14; Prupe.6G255800.1 had whole R2 and R3 repeats. Although ppa023926m, Prupe.3G219200.1, Prupe.2G307600.1, and Prupe.2G185200.1 did not have the R3 repeat, these proteins were still clustered into group C33 with AT2G37630 (AtMYB91) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199192.g003">3</xref>) in this study.

Some <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes in this study were differentially expressed at five different stages of fruit development, and no special rule was found to describe expression during the fruit development of each cultivar. This finding suggested that <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes might play an important role in the fruit development and/or ripening of peach through involvement in various aspects of physiological and physiochemical processes, combined with interactions with other genes.</p><p>Some <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes in peach fruit have been studied functionally. For example, the peach <italic>MYB7</italic> of subfamily R2R3-MYB was reported to regulate the synthesis of proanthocyanidins [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which form a group of natural phenolic compounds that greatly affect both the flavor and nutritious value of fruit. Similarly, <italic>MYB10</italic> was isolated from peach, and patches of anthocyanin were most apparent with <italic>MYB10</italic> when <italic>AtbHLH2</italic> was included as a partner [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Similarly, previous reports in other fruit tree species also demonstrated that MYB TFs such as the MYBs in Chinese bayberry [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], apple [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], litchi [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and grape [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] are critical for anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition to functioning in anthocyanin biosynthesis in the peach fruit, <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes werereported to function in other aspects of fruit development. The transition from S3 to S4 was paralleled by changes in the expression of <italic>MYB</italic> genes assessed by microarray analysis [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Vendramin provided strong evidence that the peach <italic>MYB25</italic> gene (<italic>ppa023143m</italic>) acts as a positive regulator of trichome formation in peach fruit [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In addition to their roles in fruit, <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes were also reported to be involved in the development of flowers and leaves. For example, <italic>MYB10</italic> might be involved in controlling the biosynthesis of anthocyanins in red peach leaves [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The anthocyanin accumulation in peach flowers was coordinately regulated by a set of <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0199192.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The function of the remaining <italic>MYB</italic> genes in peach should be verified further through experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study was the first genome-wide detailed analysis of the <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes in peach. In total, this study yielded a set of 256 <italic>MYB</italic> superfamily genes containing 128 <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> subfamily genes (2R-MYB), 4 <italic>R1R2R3-MYB</italic> subfamily genes (3R-MYB), 109 <italic>MYB-related subfamily</italic> genes (1R-MYB), one <italic>4R-MYB</italic> subfamily gene, and 14 <italic>Atypical-MYB</italic> subfamily genes. The 128 <italic>R2R3-MYB</italic> subfamily genes in peach were clustered into 35 groups, and the 109 <italic>MYB-related</italic> subfamily genes were further clustered into six groups: the CCA1-like, CPC-like, TBP-like, I-box-binding-like, R-R-type, and Peach-specific groups. The members of each group within the R2R3-MYB or MYB-related subfamily in peach were highly conserved in terms of their motif composition and exon/intron organization. The logo sequences of the R2 and R3 repeats of most R2R3-MYB subfamily members were highly conserved with those in several other plant species. The phylogenetic relationship between MYBs in peach and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> indicated that peach and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> displayed both the conserved and specialized evolution of MYB members. Additionally, the 256 <italic>MYB</italic> genes unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. Eighty-one pairs of <italic>MYB</italic> genes in peach and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> wereidentified as orthologs among 256 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in peach and 198 <italic>MYB</italic> genes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> in this study. In addition, 146 pairs of paralogous <italic>MYB</italic> genes were identified among the eight chromosomes of peach. The expression levels of some genes of 51 <italic>MYB</italic> genes selected for qRT-PCR analysis tended to decrease or increase in red-fleshed fruit development, while the expression patterns of some genes followed no clear rules during the five developmental stages of the fruits. Further studies are needed to unravel <italic>MYB</italic> function in peach, which may lead to better insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the growth and development of peach fruit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199192.s001"><label>S1
