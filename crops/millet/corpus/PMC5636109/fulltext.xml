Longjing11 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The encoded protein comprised of 211 amino acids is highly homologous to Cu/Zn-SOD proteins from tuscacera rice and millet. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that in rice, the level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression was lowest in roots and was highest in petals and during the S5 leaf stage. Moreover, the expression level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression decreased during the L5 leaf stage to maturity. The level of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression, however, was increased under saline&#x02013;sodic stress and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. Germination tests under 125, 150, and 175 mM NaCl revealed that <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic>-overexpressing lines performed better than the non-transgenic (NT) Longjing11 lines in terms of germination rate and height. Subjecting seedlings to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and water stress revealed that <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD-</italic>overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of SOD activity, fresh weight, root length, and height. Under simulated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress, <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD-</italic>overexpressing lines performed better than NT in terms of survival rate (25.19% &#x0003e; 6.67%) and yield traits (average grain weight 20.6 &#x0003e; 18.15 g).

The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD, <italic>EC 1</italic>.<italic>15</italic>.<italic>1</italic>.<italic>1</italic>) determines the reaction rate in any metabolic pathway in plants. SOD is the most important enzyme that responds to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is specifically produced by the biological PSI&#x02013;PS&#x0041f; system. SOD catalyzes the superoxide anion, a free radical, into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Generally, the tolerance to oxidative stress is an important factor that affects lifespan, and the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes is particularly important [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When the metabolic cycle of plant cells is disrupted, the activity of Cu/Zn-SOD enzymes is directly affected and superoxide anion radicals accumulate, thus causing oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Meanwhile, SOD is the first enzyme to clear active oxygen-free radicals, SOD activity level is associated with oxidation resistance and lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hitherto, molecular biology, structural biology, and bioinformatics techniques have been used to investigate the factors that affect SOD activity at the sequence and structure level [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Some studies have shown that C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>5</sub> enhances SOD activity, which signifying increased plant responses against damage [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The addition of exogenous proline and glycine betaine enhances the antioxidant defense system of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, the SOD activity of glyoxalase systems, and the resistance to salt-induced oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To improve genetic resources, genetic engineering has been performed by scientific workers in various countries and the study of transgenic plants has expanded. The SOD gene has been cloned from many plant species. Transgenic tobacco with the rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) chloroplast SOD gene has salt, water, and PEG stress tolerance; moreover, the tobacco chloroplast antioxidant system has been optimized [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Transgenic wheat protoplasts with the tobacco Mn-SOD gene showed lower levels of oxidative damage and higher levels of SOD and GR activities [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Transgenic <italic>Populus</italic> L. that overexpression of the <italic>Tamarix androssowii</italic> Mn-SOD gene has enhanced salt tolerance as a result of SOD activity being increased; furthermore, the relative biomass of the transgenic plants increased by 8- to 23-fold [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Put Cu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has enhanced resistance to saline&#x02013;sodic stress and growth tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Mn-SOD-overexpressing <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> shows that the tolerance to NaCl stress was increased and the levels of Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, Fe-SOD, CAT, and POD expression also have been improved under salt stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The overexpression of tobacco Mn-SOD/APX in transgenic tall fescue plant confers increased tolerance to MV, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Cu, Cd, and as stresses as a result of SOD and APX enzyme activities being increased [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The increase of SOD, CAT, GR and APX activities enhances tolerance to sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) stress in transgenic Chinese cabbage plants that overexpress the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> Mn-SOD/CAT gene [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The overexpression of Mn-SOD (<italic>Nicotiana plumbaginifolia</italic>) + Fe-SOD (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic>) in transgenic alfalfa enhances resistance against drought stress and improves photosynthetic efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The overexpression of cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) from the mangrove plant <italic>Avicennia marina</italic> in indica rice var Pusa Basmati enhances tolerance to oxidative, salt, and drought stresses [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Saline-sodic stress is caused by salt and pH variation. The in vivo accumulation of ROS injures cell membranes via lipid oxidation, and the accumulation of a large amount of membrane lipid peroxidation products, such as MDA is a cause or product of membrane lipid peroxidation, and also is one of the most obvious indicators of oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. So far, there have been few reports on the regulatory effects of CuZn-SOD overexpression on saline&#x02013;sodic stress tolerance in rice.</p><p>In this study, we cloned the chloroplast OsCu/Zn-SOD gene in <italic>O</italic>.<italic>sativa</italic> Long jing11, which belongs to one of the eight SOD genes identified in rice including 5 Cu/ZnSODs, 2 FeSODs, and 1 MnSOD[<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We performed subcellular localization analysis to verify that OsCu/Zn-SOD localized in the chloroplast. Then, we compared the resistance of transgenic rice to NaCl stress with that of non-transgenic (NT) rice during germination and the tolerance of transgenic rice to sodic salt (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) stress with that of NT rice during the seedling stage of growth. We compared the physiological indexes of OsCu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing transgenic with NT rice lines under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress during vegetative growth. We simulated the effects of OsCu/Zn-SOD gene overexpression on seed-setting in rice under sodic salt stress. Our study provides the experimental foundation for analyzing the protective mechanism of chloroplast Cu/Zn-SOD in salt&#x02013;sodic-induced oxidative stress and for novel rice cultivars with tolerance for saline&#x02013;sodic stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material</title><p>Seeds of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> L. var.

Regions with saline&#x02013;sodic soils account for 5% of the earth's arable areas. Salinity&#x02013;sodicity damage mainly occurs as a result of high Na+ ions and high pH value. Salinity&#x02013;sodicity damage can slow down the growth and development of plant vegetative organs; decrease the activity of antioxidant enzymes in cells and cause the excessive oxidation of cell membranes, thus leading to metabolic disorders even acceleration of cell senescence and death [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The lifespan of organisms is intrinsically associated with the level of SOD enzyme activity and the ability to resist oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, plants have developed efficient strategies to alleviate the harmful effects of ROS during evolution. The enzymatic system such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) provides a dynamic balance of ROS concentration in plants [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> gene was cloned from Longjing 11 rice in this study. The cloned <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> gene encodes an amino acid sequence that contains Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding sites and a SOD active domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g001">Fig 1</xref>). qRT&#x02014;PCR detection showed that saline&#x02013;sodic stress upregulated the level of <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> expression in transcripts, particularly in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This result illustrated that the level of the OsCu/Zn-SOD gene expression in rice during growth and development under salt stress is similar to that of the cytoplasmic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) gene in the rotifer <italic>Brachionus calyciflorus</italic> under temperature and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The high level of <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> expression in leaves is related to its subcellular localization in the chloroplast. The subcellular localization of a protein provides indirect evidence for protein function, which could be further elucidated and verified in future experiments. Protein synthesis in the cytoplasm is guided by a protein screening signal. Proteins may be transported to a specific organelle, secreted outside the cell, or remain in the cytoplasm. Cell function will be profoundly affected if protein localization deviates from the norm [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To verify the localization of <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> protein in the chloroplastid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we used epidermal cells of onion via particle bombardment and the localization of <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic> protein in the chloroplastid indicates its function in active oxygen scavenging. Saline&#x02013;alkali stress induces the excessive production of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and other ROS. What&#x02019;s worse, under the saline alkali environment, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme protection system was decrased, which causes ROS overproduction and disturbs clearing balance in plants [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0186052.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This study revealed that the <italic>OsCuZn-SOD</italic>-overexpressing lines showed better resistance to NaCl stress during germination than NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The transgenic lines had a significant advantage over NT in terms of root length, plant height, and fresh weight. These results are similar to those of At <italic>Cu/Zn-SOD</italic>-overexpressing alfalfa lines with enhanced low-temperature resistance [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. With the increase of membrane lipid peroxidation since the increase in stress intensity, MDA content was increased as increased; therefore, MDA production is an important indicator of the degree of damage to the plant [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although MDA content in transgenic plants and in NT increased after NaCl stress treatment, MDA content in transgenic lines was significantly lower than that in NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g006">Fig 6</xref>), illustrating that the overexpression of <italic>OsCuZn-SOD</italic> gene enhanced ROS scavenging, reduced oxidative stress damage and MDA production. These results are similar to those of overexpressing of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>marina Cu/Zn-SOD</italic> gene under drought and NaCl stress treatment in rice [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Saline&#x02013;sodic stress is a carbonate-dominated complex salt stress that is characterized by high Na<sup>+</sup> ions and high pH value. The present study found that the growth of <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic>-overexpressing lines and NT were all inhibited after NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress treatment. Moreover, the degree of damage increased as stress intensity increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g006">Fig 6</xref>); this response is consistent with that under Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> treatment [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Under 5, 7.5, or 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress treatment, the <italic>OsCu/Zn-SOD</italic>-overexpressing lines had higher values for height, fresh weight, and chlorophyll index than NT. The Cu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing tobacco plants possess resistance to NaCl, water logging, and PEG stress, as well an optimized chloroplast antioxidant system [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, transgenic tobacco plants that overexpress TaSOD1.1 and TaSOD1.2 have improved physiological functions under NaCl stress, as well as enhanced resistance to salt stress [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Under NaCl stress, Cu/Zn-SOD-overexpressing transgenic rice had higher SOD activity than NT, which was consistent with the significant increase in Cu/Zn-SOD activity under the low temperature of 3&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The overexpression of Cu/Zn-SOD gene also improves excess superoxide radical scavenging and alleviates damage to the plant body. In addition, the content of oxygen free radicals in the leaves of overexpression Cu/Zn-SOD gene rice plants was lower than that in NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186052.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Similarly, the accumulation of active oxygen free radicals decreased when <italic>Kandelia candel</italic>-derived Cu/Zn-SOD is overexpressed in tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0186052.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The 35S promoter increased the transcription level of the Cu/Zn-SOD gene, thus increasing SOD activity. In turn, the tolerance to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress was increased via the improved ROS balance, which becomes a protective role in chloroplast photosynthesis. When cultivated under field conditions in soils with a 1:1 ratio of salinity to sodicity, the transgenic lines grew and developed better than the NT lines. Therefore, the results of the present study will establish the foundation for the cultivation of rice lines which can be grown on saline&#x02013;sodic soil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186052.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Germination tests were then conducted in 50 mg/L Hyg solution.</title><p>Although seeds from both NT and T1 #1, 2, 3 were able to germinate, the plumule color and radicle growth of the strains showed drastic differences after 9 days.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186052.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186052.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Effects of the relative concentration of superoxide anion in the 5-day rice seedings of NT and T3 #1, 2, 3, germinated under the NaCl stress.</title><p>Bars = 2mm.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186052.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APX</term><def><p>ascorbic acid peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p>catalase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CaMV</term><def><p>Cauliflower mosaic virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFP</term><def><p>green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GR</term><def><p>glutathione reductase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LJ11</term><def><p>LongJing11</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDA</term><def><p>Malondialdehyde</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MS</term><def><p>Murashige and Skoog</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NT</term><def><p>Non-transgenic rice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POD</term><def><p>peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p>reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD</term><def><p>superoxide dismutase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p>Wild type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0186052.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Foyer</surname><given-names>C.
