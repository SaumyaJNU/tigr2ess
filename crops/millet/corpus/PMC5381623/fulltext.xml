A review of the process also suggests that this bias towards adaptive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation might be less pronounced at the intraspecific level compared with the interspecific level. In this study, we assessed the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation to adaptation at the intraspecific level using populations of wild pearl millet (<italic>Cenchrus americanus</italic> ssp. <italic>monodii</italic>) sampled along an environmental gradient in Niger. From RNA sequencing of hybrids to assess allele-specific expression, we identified genes with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence between two parental accessions collected in contrasted environmental conditions. This revealed that &#x0223c;15% of transcribed genes showed <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation. Intersecting the gene set exhibiting <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation with the gene set identified as targets of selection revealed no excess of <italic>cis</italic>-acting mutations among the selected genes. We additionally found no excess of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation among genes associated with adaptive traits. As our approach relied on methods identifying mainly genes submitted to strong selection pressure or with high phenotypic effect, the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes to soft selection or polygenic adaptive traits remains to be tested.

One debated question in this field is the relative contribution of protein-coding and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation to adaptation. It is generally accepted that mutations in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions are the favorite target of evolutionary changes (<xref rid="evx004-B22" ref-type="bibr">King and Wilson 1975</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoekstra and Coyne 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B54" ref-type="bibr">Wray 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B45" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wittkopp and Kalay 2011</xref>). The main argument supporting this assumption (reviewed in <xref rid="evx004-B45" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo 2008</xref>) is that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations might have fewer deleterious pleiotropic effects than mutations altering the amino-acid sequence of a protein. Indeed, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions are composed of noncoding DNA regulating the expression of nearby gene through promoters and enhancers. The modular nature of the architecture of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element (CRE) implies that changes in CREs may result in specific changes in gene expression limited to a particular tissue, life stage or environmental condition (<xref rid="evx004-B39" ref-type="bibr">Prud&#x02019;homme et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>). Conversely, changes in sequence of coding regions would affect all the subsequent genetic pathways in which the gene product, protein or mature RNA, is involved.</p><p>This <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory hypothesis of phenotypic evolution has been challenged many times (<xref rid="evx004-B2" ref-type="bibr">Alonso and Wilkins 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B20" ref-type="bibr">Hoekstra and Coyne 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B27" ref-type="bibr">Lynch and Wagner 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B50" ref-type="bibr">Wagner and Lynch 2008</xref>). Using a compilation of studies aiming at identifying mutations underlying phenotypic evolution, <xref rid="evx004-B45" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo (2008)</xref> highlighted a contrasting tendency of protein-coding and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations contributions to evolutionary changes depending on the evolutionary time-scale. They found a higher proportion of null coding mutations causing phenotypic variation among studies based on intraspecific comparisons (genes involved in adaptive divergence over short evolutionary time-scales) and higher proportion of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations among studies based on interspecific comparisons (long evolutionary time-scales). <xref rid="evx004-B46" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo (2009)</xref> argued that for a short period of evolution, adaptive mutations may be selected even if they have a deleterious pleiotropic effect because nondeleterious mutations are absent. In contrast, after a long period of evolution, adaptive mutations with no pleiotropic deleterious effects have more opportunity to occur and to be selected. However this hypothesis mainly relied on a collection of selected genes across organisms that might be biased in some way (<xref rid="evx004-B6" ref-type="bibr">Coolon et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Other experimental studies on yeast (<xref rid="evx004-B17" ref-type="bibr">Gruber et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B35" ref-type="bibr">Metzger et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) showed that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations arose less frequently with more moderate effects on phenotypic trait than other type of mutations potentially explaining their higher contribution to adaptive divergence over a longer period of time. Yet, the impact of selection on transcriptome-wide <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation over short and long time-scales remains to be clarified. Although contribution of allele-specific expression variation (aseQTLs) to purifying selection has been recently addressed in plant (<xref rid="evx004-B21" ref-type="bibr">Josephs et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), much remains to be done to fully understand the relation between adaptation and <italic>cis</italic>-regulation at the different time-scales of evolution.</p><p>The usual way to directly identify genes with <italic>cis</italic>-regulation variation is to investigate allelic expression in F1 hybrids, as <italic>cis</italic>-acting polymorphism causes unequal expression of the two parental alleles, or allele-specific expression (ASE). When ASE is observed, it could be due to genetic or methylation changes in CRE or insertion of transposable elements (<xref rid="evx004-B52" ref-type="bibr">Wittkopp and Kalay 2011</xref>). ASE should reflect only the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes and not <italic>trans</italic>-effects as <italic>trans</italic>-acting variation should act on the expression of both alleles within an individual. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) makes it possible to distinguish parental alleles from nucleotide variation and hence quantify differential transcript abundance patterns of two parental alleles in hybrids at a genome-wide level. Such an approach using RNA-seq technology has been used in many organisms such as yeast (<xref rid="evx004-B11" ref-type="bibr">Emerson et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), drosophila (<xref rid="evx004-B34" ref-type="bibr">McManus et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B6" ref-type="bibr">Coolon et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) and plants (<xref rid="evx004-B18" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="evx004-B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B23" ref-type="bibr">Lemmon et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B44" ref-type="bibr">Steige et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B3" ref-type="bibr">Arunkumar et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) to address the question of <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>-regulatory contribution to phenotypic divergence focusing mainly on the inter-specific level (<xref rid="evx004-B28" ref-type="bibr">Mack et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). The intraspecific role of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence in accessions collected in natural populations has been less explored to date (but see <xref rid="evx004-B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Borevitz 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B7" ref-type="bibr">Cubillos et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B43" ref-type="bibr">Steige et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>), and based on the hypothesis of <xref rid="evx004-B46" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo (2009)</xref>, one would expect to observe weaker or no association between <italic>cis</italic>-regulation and selection.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence between genotypes of the outcrossing pearl millet wild relative (<italic>Cenchrus americanus</italic> ssp. <italic>monodii</italic>) sampled in contrasted ecological habitats. Pearl millet produced in the driest environment on earth is a staple crop in Africa and India. Its wild progenitor species can be found in the Sahelian region in Africa, the probable domestication center, distributed along a south&#x02013;north gradient of humidity (<xref rid="evx004-B30" ref-type="bibr">Mariac et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B10" ref-type="bibr">Dussert et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). By sampling populations along this gradient, <xref rid="evx004-B4" ref-type="bibr">Berthouly-Salazar et&#x000a0;al. (2016)</xref> used genome scanning to identify genomic variation correlated with climatic variables and hence to find genomic regions potentially involved in local adaptation. In another study, <xref rid="evx004-B37" ref-type="bibr">Ousseini et&#x000a0;al. (2016)</xref> showed that between-population phenotypic variability correlates with environmental conditions of origin in a common garden experiment and built an association genetics framework to identify the genomic regions involved in variation in adaptive traits.</p><p>Here, we used the same data to investigate the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes to adaptation at the intraspecific level of wild pearl millet. We first used ASE to infer the presence of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation affecting gene expression among wild-pearl millet accessions sampled from the most extreme habitats along the environmental gradient. Then, using the results of previous studies on wild pearl millet adaptation, we tested for enrichment of ASE genes among the selected genes and among the genes associated with adaptive traits. Our main results suggest that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation is not the main driver of short-term intraspecific adaptation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant Material</title><p>Two accessions of wild pearl millet (<italic>Cenchrus americanus</italic> (L.)

Then we assessed the reference ratio derived from DNA sequencing and tested the difference between the allelic ratios obtained from the DNA and the RNA data using a Fisher exact test. A position was considered as ASE if both the two tests were significant. The rationale of this methodology is as follows: (1) to identify positions showing disequilibrium in read count for one allele compared with the other in the transcriptomic data and (2) among those positions, to exclude sites showing the same pattern of read count disequilibrium at the genomic level. Indeed, deviation from the expected 0.5 value of allelic ratio can be observed in genomic data as well as in transcriptomic data due to biases occurring during the mapping step either associated with copy number variation (CNV) or higher mappability of reads carrying the reference allele compared with the one carrying the alternate allele. To avoid no-independence between counts, we only considered SNPs separated by &#x0003e;100 bp. The whole analysis was performed separately for each hybrid.</p><p>Our analysis enabled the identification of ASE at the level of SNPs. Using the intersect function of bedtools (v2.25) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/">http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/</ext-link>; last accessed January 27, 2017), SNPs were assigned to genes identified in the GFF file of cultivated pearl millet (Varshney RK, personal communication). Genes were considered ASE if at least one of their SNPs was identified as ASE.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis</title><p>Considering genes annotated in the pearl millet genome only, we tested for enrichment of gene ontology (GO) biological process terms within the ASE genes using Fisher exact tests implemented in the R package TopGO v.2.22 (<xref rid="evx004-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alexa et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). We performed both classical and weight01 algorithms, the latter taking the hierarchical relationships between terms into account. To reduce statistical artifacts of GO terms with few annotated genes, terms supported by less than five annotated genes were excluded from the enrichment analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Joint Analysis of ASE, Selection, and Association</title><p>We tested whether there was an excess of genes with evidence for ASE among genes identified as selected in a previous related study (<xref rid="evx004-B4" ref-type="bibr">Berthouly-Salazar et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). That study was based on a RNA seq experiment in which reads were mapped to the wild pearl millet reference transcriptome to identify SNPs and to detect the selected contigs. Intersecting the ASE gene set from our experiment with the gene set detected as selected in the previous study required localizing the selected contigs with the SNP used for the ASE experiment on the genome. To that end, contigs from the pearl millet reference transcriptome were mapped to the reference genome using BWA to extract the contig coordinates on the reference genome. On the 50,313 contigs of the reference transcriptome, 49,107 were mapped in 134,167 fragments with a minimal size of 30 bp. We discarded the contigs mapped on different chromosomes and the contigs with fragments on the same chromosome separated by an interval exceeding 1 mega bp. Finally we intersected the contig coordinates on the reference genome with the previously identified SNPs coordinates. We discarded ambiguous SNPs located on two or more different contigs and those separated by &#x0003c;100 bp. We identified ASE contig containing at least one ASE SNP as described in the previous section. We tested for enrichment of ASE contigs among the selected contigs using a one-sided Fisher exact test in R v. 3.2 for each hybrid separately. To estimate the ability of our approach to find enrichment of ASE genes among the selected genes, we first tested the power of our tests to detect an excess of a given percentage of ASE genes among the selected one using simulations. We also inferred the posterior distribution of ASE genes proportion among the selected genes fitting our data, i.e. with a higher <italic>P</italic> value than observed for the tests carried on our data. Finally, as the methods used in <xref rid="evx004-B4" ref-type="bibr">Berthouly-Salazar et&#x000a0;al.

In that work, a total of 11 phenotypic traits related to flowering time, flowering abundance and vegetative architecture were measured. Association with those traits was tested for 216 SNPs localized in 148 contigs of the wild pearl millet reference transcriptome.

<italic>Cis</italic>-Regulatory Divergence Quantification in Wild-Pearl Millet Accessions</title><p>In this study, we quantified allele-specific variation using whole transcriptome sequencing to investigate the role of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation in adaptation at the intraspecific level. We found &#x0223c;15% genes showing unequal expression of the two parental alleles within F1 hybrids due to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences between the two wild pearl millet accessions sampled from contrasting environmental habitats. This rate is at the lower-bound of ASE rate values ranging from &#x0223c;15% (<xref rid="evx004-B18" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>) to 80% (<xref rid="evx004-B42" ref-type="bibr">Skelly et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>) in studies investigating ASE genome-wide for other organisms.</p><p>Several factors could explain the relatively low rate of ASE genes found in our study and the high variability of the proportion of ASE found between experiments. First, as the ASE rate depends on genetic variability among the two genotypes being studied for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence, this ratio is expected to depend on the divergence time separating the two genotypes. Thus, interspecific crosses should have a higher ASE rate than intraspecific crosses. This was observed in experiments investigating the two cases with the same pipeline of analysis. For instance, <xref rid="evx004-B18" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al. (2012)</xref> found 13.5% of the genes with unbalanced expression of the two parental alleles from an intraspecific cross of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The ratio reached 15% for an interspecific cross between <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>. The same tendency was observed by <xref rid="evx004-B43" ref-type="bibr">Steige et&#x000a0;al. (2017</xref> and 2015) in the <italic>Capsella</italic> genus with 35% ASE genes at the intraspecific level compared with the 40% ASE genes at the interspecific level. <xref rid="evx004-B18" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al. (2012)</xref> reported that the difference between the two specific levels is not as high. They suggested that the extent of functional divergence should be constrained. It should also be noted that the methodological identification of ASE genes relies on crosses between divergent genotypes and should therefore constrain ASE experiments to species that have not diverged too far.</p><p>Second, the observed ASE ratio is probably strongly influence by the stringency of bioinformatics pipeline and the statistical analysis of the data of each specific study. The classification of ASE using RNA-seq data basically relies on read mapping to extract allele-specific read counts at heterozygous positions followed by statistical analysis of the expression data. For now, these two technical issues are still the subject of debate and vary greatly among ASE analyses with NGS (reviewed in <xref rid="evx004-B5" ref-type="bibr">Castel et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>) and should therefore partly explain the high variability of the ASE rate between the different studies. <xref rid="evx004-B8" ref-type="bibr">Degner et&#x000a0;al. (2009)</xref> showed that the reliability in ASE estimation depends to a great extent on the ability to control for read-mapping bias. As the reference genome contains only one allele at each genomic position, reads carrying the reference allele have more chance of being mapped at the right position than reads carrying the alternative allele, thus presenting at least one mismatch with the reference genome. Not taking this issue into account is expected to lead to overestimation of the ASE. Several approaches have been proposed to circumvent the mapping bias issue such as SNP-masked genome at known heterozygous positions (<xref rid="evx004-B8" ref-type="bibr">Degner et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>), including known polymorphism data in an enhanced reference genome (<xref rid="evx004-B49" ref-type="bibr">Vijaya Satya et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>) or mapping reads on the two parental genomes (<xref rid="evx004-B34" ref-type="bibr">McManus et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B41" ref-type="bibr">Rozowsky et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). As the read mapping bias is also probably influenced by unidentified polymorphisms, the two first methods failed to fully remove the mapping bias (<xref rid="evx004-B8" ref-type="bibr">Degner et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B5" ref-type="bibr">Castel et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). The latter strategy has been found to be more reliable but relies on the haplotype reconstruction of the two parental genomes. This approach could be challenging for a nonmodel organism with a large genome and heterozygous parental genotypes collected directly in the field. In our study, we chose to adopt a stringent filtering strategy of heterozygous positions by removing too polymorphic regions (<xref rid="evx004-B53" ref-type="bibr">Wood et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>) and limiting the read counts to sections with only one identified SNP within a 100-bp window corresponding to the maximum size of a read. This strategy allowed us to efficiently control for mapping bias and to attain a reference ratio of 0.518, which is slightly above the expected nonbiased 0.5 reference ratio. Furthermore, the remaining mapping bias was taken into account in the statistical test being performed for ASE classification. Finally, the proportion of ASE should greatly vary depending on the statistical test being applied to classify genes as ASE. The binomial test is the simplest way of testing for ASE and is widely used (<xref rid="evx004-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fontanillas et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B14" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B7" ref-type="bibr">Cubillos et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Other tests based on a beta-binomial modeling of allele-specific read counts have been developed (<xref rid="evx004-B42" ref-type="bibr">Skelly et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B24" ref-type="bibr">Le&#x000f3;n-Novelo et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B47" ref-type="bibr">van de Geijn et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). As many methods and pipelines have been recently published, further tests are now needed to compare the available approaches for ASE inference.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution of <italic>C</italic>
<italic>is</italic>-Regulatory Variation to Adaptive Evolution at the Intraspecific Level</title><p>The ASE analysis performed here allowed the identification of genes exhibiting <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation between accessions evolving in contrasted environments. The parental genotypes used in our study were collected directly in the field and originated from very divergent habitats particularly with respect to humidity and temperature variables. Phenotypic characterization in common garden experiments highlight the high phenotypic variability among populations originating from the two parental genotypes (<xref rid="evx004-B37" ref-type="bibr">Ousseini et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). Northern populations, originated from a drier area, present smaller plants with fewer spikes that flower earlier than southern populations when evaluated in a common environment. These repeated observations along two environmental gradients of collection (in Niger as in the present study and in Mali) suggest that these changes are adaptive.</p><p>From GO annotations of pearl millet genes, we found that the genes with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence were significantly enriched in some GO terms that were specific to each hybrid. This result depending on the direction of the cross could be explained either by the difference in depth of sequencing between the two hybrids or by false positive inherent to GO term enrichment approaches (<xref rid="evx004-B38" ref-type="bibr">Pavlidis et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). We further found that the genes with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence between the two parental accessions were significantly enriched in GO terms related to &#x0201c;defense response&#x0201d; (GO:0006952) in the two hybrids. Thus, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variable genes are probably involved in the adaptive phenotypic divergence observed among populations. However, when we intersected our ASE gene set with the set of genes potentially involved in adaptation identified in another study based on the same populations (<xref rid="evx004-B4" ref-type="bibr">Berthouly-Salazar et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>), we found that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation contribute to adaptation of our populations but they are not over-represented among the selected genes nor among genes potentially involved in adaptive trait variation. Altogether, our results suggest that adaptation do not rely more on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation in our experiment than expected by chance. It should be noticed that the method used to detect the genes under selection is more effective for strong signature of selection (<xref rid="evx004-B4" ref-type="bibr">Berthouly-Salazar et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). Such approach might be less effective to identify selection from standing variation or with small phenotypic effect inducing soft signature of selection (<xref rid="evx004-B55" ref-type="bibr">Yeaman 2015</xref>). Therefore, from our experimental design we were not able to exclude the possibility of higher contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation to the latter type of selection. However, our finding is consistent with other studies claiming that the implication of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation in phenotypic evolution varies depending on the divergence time between genotypes. The idea first emerged from a compilation of studies showing a greater proportion of null coding mutations causing phenotypic variation in intraspecific comparisons that contrast with the greater proportion of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations in interspecific comparisons (<xref rid="evx004-B45" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo 2008</xref>, <xref rid="evx004-B46" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Some experimental validations then appeared in comparative studies investigating both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory divergence from intra and inter-crosses within the <italic>drosophila</italic> genus (<xref rid="evx004-B51" ref-type="bibr">Wittkopp et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B6" ref-type="bibr">Coolon et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) and in yeast (<xref rid="evx004-B11" ref-type="bibr">Emerson et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>). The main argument supporting discordance depending on the divergence time is that <italic>trans</italic>-acting mutations are more frequent whereas <italic>cis</italic>-acting mutations arise less often but are more likely to be fixed within a population over time due to the reduced pleiotropic effect of those mutations (<xref rid="evx004-B51" ref-type="bibr">Wittkopp et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>) and a higher effect on gene expression (<xref rid="evx004-B17" ref-type="bibr">Gruber et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B35" ref-type="bibr">Metzger et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). From our experimental design, we were not able to quantify <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory divergence in our plant material since we used highly heterozygous parental accessions directly collected in the field which prevented us from precisely identifying the parental origin of the alleles in the hybrids. However, our study is the first to investigate the intraspecific contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence to adaptive evolution using accessions from natural populations instead of inbred parental lines from laboratories usually used in such studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our study, we succeeded in quantifying ASE in wild pearl millet, a nonmodel organism, from parental genotypes collected directly in the field. With a careful and stringent analysis pipeline, we were able to confidently identify genes with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence between genotypes at the intraspecific level. The low ASE rate compared with other studies was probably due to the short divergence time and to the stringency of the pipeline we used. Finally, our results are consistent with the expectation that at the intraspecific level <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation are not predominantly involved in adaptive evolution. While our study helped investigate the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory divergence to adaptive traits, technical advances will enable us to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, for example by investigating the role of isoforms in adaptive evolution (<xref rid="evx004-B15" ref-type="bibr">Gao et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="evx004-B29" ref-type="bibr">Mallarino et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>) and offer an integrative view of the interactions between regulatory mechanisms and alternative transcription. </p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
