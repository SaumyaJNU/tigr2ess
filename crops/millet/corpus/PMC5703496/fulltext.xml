It acts as a free radical scavenger as well as a source of reducing power for several cellular processes. Because of its pivotal role in regulating plant growth under optimal as well as sub-optimal conditions, it becomes obligatory for plants to maintain a pool of reduced ascorbic acid. Several cellular processes help in maintaining the reduced ascorbic acid pool, by regulating its synthesis and regeneration processes. Current study demonstrates that monodehydroascorbate reductase is an important enzyme responsible for maintaining the reduced ascorbate pool, by optimizing the recycling of oxidized ascorbate. Cloning and functional characterization of this important stress inducible gene is of great significance for its imperative use in plant stress management. Therefore, we have cloned and functionally validated the role of monodehydroascorbate reductase gene (<italic>mdar</italic>) from a drought tolerant variety of <italic>Eleusine coracana</italic>. The cloned <italic>Ecmdar</italic> gene comprises of 1437bp CDS, encoding a 478 amino acid long polypeptide. The active site analysis showed presence of conserved Tyr<sub>348</sub> residue, facilitating the catalytic activity in electron transfer mechanism. qPCR expression profiling of <italic>Ecmdar</italic> under stress indicated that it is an early responsive gene. The analysis of <italic>Ecmdar</italic> overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic lines suggests that monodehydroascorbate reductase acts as a key stress regulator by modulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes to strengthen the ROS scavenging ability and maintains ROS homeostasis. Thus, it is evident that <italic>Ecmdar</italic> is an important gene for cellular homeostasis and its over-expression could be successfully used to strengthen stress tolerance in crop plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="15"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="29"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All nucleotide and protein sequence are available from the NCBI database (Accession number KT230521.1).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All nucleotide and protein sequence are available from the NCBI database (Accession number KT230521.1).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ascorbic acid is a vital antioxidant molecule that plays a crucial role in removal of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), by enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic scavenging mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It participates in numerous developmental processes such as cell division, cell expansion and cell wall growth [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is widely reported that ascorbate is used as a crucial cellular factor for inducing tolerance against abiotic stresses such as drought, temperature, salinity, ozone and high light intensity [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A high redox status of ascorbate in plant cells is required for adaptation of plants to environmental stresses [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Reduced ascorbate pool is maintained in cells through synthesis, recycling and transportation [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ascorbate is oxidized to monodehydroascorbate (MDHA) and then to dehydroascorbate (DHA), by enzymatic action of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and ascorbate oxidase (AAO) respectively and non-enzymatic reaction like detoxification of toco-trienoxyl radical during the process of ROS scavenging [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Oxidized forms of ascorbate i.e. MDHA and DHA are converted back to reduced ascorbate by monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) using NADH or NADPH as electron donor and by dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) using reduced glutathione (GSH) as an electron donor, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Monodehydroascorbate, a radical, is the primary product of AsA oxidation in ROS scavenging reactions, which is further oxidized to dehydroascorbate by non-enzymatic reaction. Further, DHAR utilizes two molecules of NADPH+ H<sup>+</sup> in the process of reduction of DHA to ascorbate, whereas MDAR utilizing only one molecule of NADPH. Therefore, regeneration of reduced ascorbate via MDAR is an economical option for the stressed plants. Thus, monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR EC 1.6.5.4) appears to be an important enzyme regulating the reduced AsA pool [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and is a key component in the stress tolerance profile of a plant.</p><p>Finger millet (<italic>Eleusine coracana</italic>) is a stress-hardy crop, having wide adaptability for environmental conditions, as it grows in different climatic regions of Africa and Asia. In India, it is cultivated in different climatic zones such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh (near to sea level) and in hills of Uttarakhand (1600 m above sea level) [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Finger millet possesses highly active antioxidant machinery, making this crop capable of withstanding unfavorable conditions. Although varietal differences, towards the stress tolerance potential, are known to exist in finger millet, specific abiotic stress tolerant varieties can be used for allele mining of important genes [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Limited information is available in finger millet, towards cloning and stress tolerance profiling of <italic>mdar</italic> through over-expression studies [<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187793.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further, partial <italic>Ecmdar</italic> sequence information available in database (UniP ID-D3K3M7<monospace>,</monospace> NCBI&#x02013;HQ625516), provides only a diminutive view about the functional and structural annotation of monodehydroascorbate reductase. Therefore, in the present study, attempts were made to clone the monodehydroascorbate reductase gene (<italic>mdar)</italic>, from a drought tolerant variety of finger millet (PR202), and perform its structural annotation using <italic>in</italic>-<italic>silico</italic> tools and functional validation through overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.
