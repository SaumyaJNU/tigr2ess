    "Rice straw is valuable resource that has been used as substrate for cost effective production of xylanase under solid-state fermentation by a newly isolated white rot fungi, S. commune ARC-11. Out of eleven carbon sources tested, rice straw was found most effective for the induction of xylanase that produced 4288.3 IU/gds of xylanase by S. commune ARC-11. Maximum xylanase production (6721.9 IU/gds) was observed on 8th day of incubation at temperature (30 °C), initial pH (7.0) and initial moisture content (70.0%). The supplementation of ammonium sulphate (0.08% N, as available nitrogen) enhanced the xylanase production up to 8591.4 IU/gds. The xylanase production by S. commune ARC-11 was further improved by the addition of 0.10%, (w/v) of Tween-20 as surfactant. The maximum xylanase activities were found at pH 5.0 and temperature 55 °C with a longer stability (180 min) at temperature 45, 50 and 55 °C. This xylanase preparation was also evaluated for the pre-bleaching of ethanol-soda pulp from Eulaliopsis binata. An enzyme dosage of 10 IU/g of xylanase resulted maximum decrease in kappa number (14.51%) with a maximum improvement 2.9% in ISO brightness compared to control."
