<bold>Background: </bold>Sensory neurons play an essential role in almost all pain conditions, and have recently been classified into distinct subsets on the basis of their transcriptomes. Here we have analysed alterations in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) gene expression using microarrays in mouse models related to human chronic pain.</p><p>
<bold>Methods: </bold>Six different pain models were studied in male C57BL/6J mice: (1) bone cancer pain using cancer cell injection in the intramedullary space of the femur; (2) neuropathic pain using partial sciatic nerve ligation; (3) osteoarthritis pain using mechanical joint loading; (4) chemotherapy-induced pain with oxaliplatin; (5) chronic muscle pain using hyperalgesic priming; and (6) inflammatory pain using intraplantar complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant. Microarray analyses were performed using RNA isolated from dorsal root ganglia and compared to sham/vehicle treated controls.</p><p>
<bold>Results: </bold>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Known and previously unreported genes were found to be dysregulated in each pain model. The transcriptomic profiles for each model were compared and expression profiles of DEGs within subsets of DRG neuronal populations were analysed to determine whether specific neuronal subsets could be linked to each of the pain models.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Each pain model exhibits a unique set of altered transcripts implying distinct cellular responses to different painful stimuli. No simple direct link between genetically distinct sets of neurons and particular pain models could be discerned.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Chronic pain</kwd><kwd>mouse models</kwd><kwd>dorsal root ganglia</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>microarrays</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440"><funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source><award-id>200183</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a Wellcome Collaborative Award [200183].</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pain is a major clinical problem affecting roughly 20% of the population with more than 6% suffering debilitating levels of pain
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Despite the huge clinical burden, little progress has been made in developing more effective analgesic agents. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons are particularly exciting targets for drug development because of their essential role in driving pain sensations in the central nervous system. With the wider availability of high-throughput RNA-seq, there has been a major effort to define DRG transcriptomes, both at the level of whole ganglia
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and single neurons
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. This has allowed a new classification of sets of sensory neurons based on genetic identity, rather than on the rate of action potential propagation (A fibres and C fibres). As well as neurons, non-neuronal cells such as glia
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and immune system cells are found within sensory ganglia, with leukocytes alone making up 5&#x02013;10% of cells in DRG
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>We wondered if the newly defined sensory neuron subsets were differentially activated in different pain models. We therefore performed microarray analyses of RNAs isolated from the DRG of male mice subjected to six different interventions that mimic common chronic pain in human patients. DRG were dissected after the development of peak pain behaviours in each case. The six different chronic pain models were: cancer cell injection in the intramedullary space of the femur as a model for bone cancer pain; partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) for neuropathic pain; mechanical joint loading for osteoarthritis pain; oxaliplatin-induced painful neuropathy for chemotherapy-induced pain; hyperalgesic priming model for chronic muscle pain and intraplantar complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA) for inflammatory pain. The rodent models for PSL
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, CFA
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, chemotherapy induced pain with oxaliplatin
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, bone cancer pain
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and hyperalgesic priming
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> are well characterized. The mechanical joint loading model robustly recapitulates behavioural signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p> By comparing altered levels of gene expression in six distinct chronic pain models we hoped to gain insights into the neuronal subsets that are particularly important in different pain conditions. We also could determine genes and related pathways that are common or unique to each condition. Here we show that there is no simple relationship between transcriptional changes in the newly defined subsets of sensory neurons and particular painful insults. However, we have identified several known and previously unreported genes altered in expression in each pain condition. Relevant pathways and upstream regulators were also analysed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis including cytokines, transcription factors (TFs), G-protein coupled receptors (GCPRs) and ion channels. The results from these experiments highlight the complexity of sensory neuron cell types involved in nociceptive responses. Although altered DRG gene expression may not necessarily play a causal role in pain, some dysregulated genes are potential analgesic drug targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with prior approval under a Home Office project licence (PPL 70/7382). Mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with food and water
<italic>ad libitum.</italic> All animals were acclimatized for 1 week to the facility before the start of the experiment. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (Techniplast GM500 Mouse IVC Green line) containing Lignocel bedding with a maximum of 5 adult mice per cage. All tests and surgeries were conducted using adult male C57BL/6J mice supplied by Charles River and Envigo (specific numbers detailed in the figure legends and ages detailed below for each model). Sample size for each behavioural model was calculated using G*Power (Ver. 3.1.9.2) for a power of 0.8
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Surgical procedures were performed by trained researchers and under aseptic conditions. All efforts were made to ameliorate any suffering of the animals with surgery performed under anaesthesia. Mice were euthanized by CO

Cells were split at 70&#x02013;80% confluence four days prior to surgery. On the day of surgery, cells were harvested with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution and resuspended in 1X DMEM at a final concentration of 2&#x000d7;10
<sup>7</sup> cells/ml and kept on ice till used. Viability of Lewis lung carcinoma cells was confirmed at the end of surgery, showing 26% dead cells compared to 11% before surgery. The cancer cells were introduced to 12 week old mice, as previously described
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Sham-operated control mice underwent the same surgery, but were inoculated with DMEM medium alone. Ipsilateral L2-L4 DRGs from test and paired sham animals were collected when a limb score of 2 was measured in the test animals (see section

A CT-analyzer was used to select a 1mm volume of interest (VOI) region, starting at 0.6mm from the growth plate. Bone mineral density was determined by plotting attenuation coefficients against a standard curve determined with two phantoms with known density. Representative images were binarized with ImageJ (1.52c) and 3D Viewer extension (Java 3D 1.6 with 3D Viewer plugin 4.0.2) used for 3D reconstructions of femur scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) model</title><p>Surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anaesthesia (2&#x02013;3%). A partial nerve injury in 14 week old mice was induced by tying a tight ligature with 6-0 silk suture around approximately 1/3 to 1/2 the diameter of the sciatic nerve, similar to the approach described in rats

<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Loading was repeated three times per week for two consecutive weeks. The non-loaded control group consisted of age- and cage-matched mice that were not subjected to a loading regimen but received isoflurane anaesthesia for the same duration as loaded mice. Ipsilateral L3&#x02013;L5 DRGs were dissected from loaded and non-loaded mice after three weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxaliplatin pain model</title><p>Seven week old mice were injected with either oxaliplatin (6mg/kg/i.p., Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle solution (5% glucose, Sigma-Aldrich) as a control twice weekly for four weeks

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Our aim was to identify dysregulated genes from the microarrays and map these genes to the neuronal populations previously outlined using single cell RNAseq data
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. However, this approach was limited by the fact that the published RNAseq data is derived from na&#x000ef;ve mice (i.e. not in pain) and potentially the gene expression patterns across the neuronal subsets may dynamically change in the pain models. This is certainly true for genes such as Galanin which is markedly upregulated and expressed in &#x0223c;40&#x02013;50% of DRG neurons following axotomy
<sup><xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and BDNF, which is upregulated in medium and large diameter DRG neurons in neuropathic pain
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, genes that have no DRG expression in the Usoskin
<italic>et al.</italic> dataset (i.e. zero sequencing reads) were not included in our transcriptomic analyses, but could be expressed following injury. For example, Neuropeptide Y is dramatically upregulated in DRG neurons following peripheral nerve injury, but is not expressed in basal conditions
<sup><xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Thirdly, many genes are broadly expressed in several DRG populations, meaning that restricted critical subsets are difficult to highlight.</p><p>Recent advances in deep sequencing have dramatically increased the number of known transcribed genes
<sup><xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The Mouse Transcriptome Array that we used gives a comprehensive coverage of the mouse transcriptome, with &#x0003e;214,000 transcripts represented. Genes that are represented include both coding and non-coding genes (such an lncRNAs, small RNAs and expressed pseudogenes). Although such genes are now known to be expressed, gene annotation and understanding of gene function is lagging behind. This is highlighted in our transcriptomic analyses where a high number of predicted genes (typically with the &#x02018;Gm&#x02019; prefix) showed differential expression. A major challenge is to determine the function of these types of genes and to ascertain the contribution, if any, to the pain phenotypes observed. Similarly, although the dense probe coverage on the array gives the opportunity to assess differential splicing patterns (
<xref ref-type="other" rid="SF3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), experimental verification is needed to prove that the changes in splicing patterns are relevant.</p><p>Given the unique sets of underlying genes, we attempted to identify potential common upstream regulators using IPA analyses. We identified several common cytokines as upstream regulators of DEGs in our pain models consistent with the role of cytokines in generation and maintenance of pain
<sup><xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, pointing to the interaction of DRG neurons and immune cells as a key point of focus. T cells are known to infiltrate DRGs in models of neuropathic pain
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, however whether the cytokine related downstream DEGs identified in our pain models are being induced by immune cells remains to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, we present a systematic study of the transcriptomic changes in six different chronic mouse pain models as a resource for the pain community. Although gene expression changes may not be causally linked to the pain phenotypes observed, the transcriptomic profiles reported here highlight the diversity of cell and molecular mechanisms apparent in different pain conditions. Potential therapeutic gene targets for the distinct chronic pain conditions studied may also be identified after further mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Data availability</title><p>Microarray data has been deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus Array Express for public use with reference number

Looking in the primary neurons the authors find that, although pain levels appear similar and significant in all the models studied, the changes in gene expression for each of the pain states is different. The paper is of great interest, and I have enjoyed trying to grapple with its contents. This is a way of saying that I like it, but I wanted to clarify a couple of things, that have raised a flag.</p><p> The discussion is written as though no gene expression data have ever been obtained before in pain models, and I agree with David Wynick that a more helpful approach would require that some context is offered in the discussion, particularly as this group of authors are generating a benchmark. For example, with reference to the findings on local inflammation, in Figure 2D I do not see a single sodium channel gene affected, and yet Na+ channel genes are reported by others to be dysregulated, for example NaV1.3 expression is reported to double in DRG in inflammatory circumstances
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-33489-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Do the authors think this is surprising and what is the reader to make of this? In fact, is Na+ channel gene expression in DRG neurons affected at all by any of the induced pain states? What has happened to other potentially important pain related ion channels such as KCNQ and HCN channels?</p><p> Is one correct deduction then that while there may indeed be stereotyped gene expression changes taking place (given that somehow the maladaptive changes in the nervous system exist for all these pain scenarios) they must be in second and higher order neurons, involving glutamate gated ion channel subunits and so on?</p><p> Secondly, as it seems inescapable to conclude that the membrane behaviour of primary sensory neurons must be somehow &#x02018;abnormal&#x02019; in pain states driven from the periphery, is the correct conclusion that this is precipitated without any necessity of modification of ion channel expression, completely by a combination of already latent functionality and post-translational modification.</p><p> I would like a little more clarification on Figure 7. I think the authors are looking a for a pattern of gene dysregulation that might conspicuously &#x02018;fit&#x02019; the already discovered baseline gene expression profiles of sub-populations of neurons. I think I understand that fitting the profiles against each subtype (previously described) reveals nothing useful, but I would be happy with a bit more explanation for this (bottom page 10 and Figure 7), as I want to rid myself of (I think !) the erroneous impression that single cell analysis is going on.</p><p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="rep-ref-33489-1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

The study design is appropriate and the work is technically sound. The data substantially expands the current evidence-base in this field.</p><p> The authors have used transcriptional profiling to identify differentially expressed genes in the mouse DRG following six different chronic pain models. Most interestingly and unexpectedly, they found almost no similarity between the transcriptional changes in expression with very little overlap in the genetic signatures between the models.</p><p> Points that could be further expanded upon in the discussion:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Place the current dataset in the context of the previous published studies that have used transcriptional profiling on the DRG after different pain models (and in some cases comparing two different models), and whether the previous findings and genes identified are consistent with the current data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identifying genes in the DRG on the basis of their fold-change after a pain model does not mean that those genes are necessarily involved in mediating pain. Indeed, many of the targets of the current analgesics used in clinical practice do not show &#x0003e;two-fold change in expression in mouse models. It is quite possible that many of the genes that do show large changes in each model play roles that relate to apoptosis, survival and/or regeneration, rather than pain transmission and nociception.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The main finding of this paper provides further evidence that it may not be possible to identify targets in the final common nociceptive pathway that will target all causes of pain and would be amendable to drug discovery. A more targeted and mechanistic approach is likely to be necessary to focus more on specific pathways that are activated and thus on the individual diseases that cause the pain.</p></list-item></list>
