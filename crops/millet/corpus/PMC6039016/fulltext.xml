Introducing legumes such as cowpea (<italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic>) into the complementary diet has the potential to improve childhood growth by improving diet quality through improvements in macro- and micronutrients and also by reducing gut inflammation. However, cowpea is relatively underutilized in complementary feeding in Malawi due to its strong taste, long processing time, and high energy requirements for processing. Effective utilization of cowpea in complementary feeding requires processing which may affect chemical composition as well as sensory quality. The present study evaluated the effect of processing on the retention of zinc, crude fibre, and flavonoid in roasted, boiled, and dehulled cowpea flours, and assessed the acceptability of maize porridge (70%) enriched with one of the three cowpea flours (30%). Roasting, dehulling, and boiling did not have any effect on zinc content. Crude fibre content increased after processing by all methods. Processing had no effect on measurable flavonoids. Roasted, boiled, and dehulled cowpea blended maize porridges were acceptable to children with mean quantities of leftover food of less than 3g from the given 100g. Caregivers also rated the blended flours to be highly acceptable to them as well, with maize porridge blended with dehulled cowpea flour the most acceptable to both children and caregivers. These results demonstrate that cowpea flour, processed by any of these three different methods, could serve as a useful addition to maize porridge for complementary feeding of children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Grain Legumes</institution></funding-source><award-id>S03.1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manary</surname><given-names>Mark J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Children&#x02019;s Discovery Institute of Washington University and St. Louis Children&#x02019;s Hospital</institution></funding-source><award-id>MD-FR-2014-427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3364-6858</contrib-id><name><surname>Trehan</surname><given-names>Indi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Grain Legumes as Project S03.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://legumelab.msu.edu/">http://legumelab.msu.edu/</ext-link>) (MJM) and the Children&#x02019;s Discovery Institute of Washington University and St. Louis Children&#x02019;s Hospital as Grant MD-FR-2014-427 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://childrensdiscovery.org/">http://childrensdiscovery.org/</ext-link>) (IT).

The problem is most pressing in rural areas where complementary feeding consists mainly of porridge made from maize flour only. The lack of potable water and other sanitary structures such as improved latrines also places rural children at a high risk of frequent enteric infections and the development of environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a subclinical condition which compromises intestinal ability to absorb nutrients, leading to physical and cognitive stunting, poor response to oral vaccines, and diminished adult potential [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Efforts to improve EED using probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have proven insufficient, as the inflammation seen histologically in EED is almost certainly much more multifactorial in aetiology. A growing body of evidence [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] suggests that a diet enriched in legumes decreases systemic markers of inflammation, making the use of legumes as part of a supplementary diet an appealing strategy to combat EED and stunting in vulnerable children.</p><p>Cowpea <italic>(Vigna unguiculata)</italic> is a widely-grown legume crop in Malawi. It is grown throughout the country, and production is high in areas where other legumes such as common beans <italic>(Phaseolus vulgaris L</italic>.<italic>)</italic> do not grow well [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cowpea immature pods and leaves are mostly utilized as vegetables with the dry seeds eaten as relish (stew) [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cowpea seeds are rich in protein (18&#x02013;25%) [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the fat content in cowpea is 1.4%-2.7% [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with about 6% crude fibre [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Amino acids derived from cowpea are an effective complement to those obtained from cereals [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cowpea also has more calcium than meat and iron content equal to milk. The content of water-soluble vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin) is comparable to the levels found in fish and lean meat [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cowpea protein isolates have good functional properties, including foaming and emulsifying activities in addition to solubility [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cowpeas also have significant anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by specific phenolic profiles and antioxidant activity [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which may be helpful in mitigating EED. Additionally, cowpea&#x02019;s high content of crude and dietary fibre, similar to other grain legumes, has significant potential for enhancing digestibility and helping maintain a healthy gut microbiota [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Despite the good nutritional profile of cowpeas and its great potential to ameliorate EED, it remains under-utilized in childhood feeding in Malawi, a country where about 37% of children under-five are stunted, 11% are underweight and 2.7% wasted [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While the nutritional value of cowpea and the traditional Malawian complementary food, maize, have been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], this study assessed selected compositional values of cowpea flours after three different forms of processing and the acceptability of maize porridge blended with these cowpea flours to young children and their caregivers in the local context of Lirangwe, Blantyre District, Malawi.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Choosing cowpea variety</title><p>The Sudan 1 variety of cowpea was chosen as it is one of the common varieties grown in rural Malawi.

Approximately 2 g of powdered raw cowpea, roasted cowpea, boiled cowpea, or dehulled cowpea flours were individually weighed and extracted for 60 minutes with petroleum ether in a Soxhlet extractor. The extracted flour was then transferred in a thimble to a 1 litre flask. Dilute sulphuric acid (200ml) was brought to a boil; the boiled acid was then transferred into the flask containing the flour and connected to a refluxing apparatus for 30 minutes with constant rotation to keep the flour from adhering to the sides of the flask and out of the acid. The flask was then removed and the contents were filtered through filter paper and washed with boiling water until the washings were acid free. This step was repeated using sodium hydroxide solution. The residue was transferred into a gooch crucible prepared with a thin compact layer of asbestos, and the residues were washed first with hot water, then 15 mL of ethanol, and finally three successive washings with petroleum ether. The crucible and contents were dried at 105&#x000b0;C for 3 hours, then cooled and weighed. Crucibles and contents were dried again at 105&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The contents in the crucible were incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550&#x000b0;C until all the carbonaceous matter was burnt. Lastly the crucible was cooled in a desiccator and weighed. The crude fibre percentage was calculated by subtracting the weight of the crucible with contents after ashing from the weight of the crucible with contents before ashing.

An additional 20 mL of HCl was then added to dissolve the residue. The mixture was then filtered into a 100 mL flask washing the residue and the filter paper with water and the resulting solution was diluted to volume with distilled water.

Informal discussions with the caregivers revealed that most had occasional access to cowpea and had used soup from the cowpea stew to flavor their child&#x02019;s porridge in the past, possibly contributing to the acceptance of cowpea. The observation that the study population was already familiar with communal feeding may have had a bearing on children&#x02019;s acceptability as the test feeding was also done at a central place.</p><p>Acceptability results agreed with the observation made by Olapade, et al. [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], who enriched Ogi (fermented cereal gruel typically made from maize, sorghum, or millet) with instant cowpea powder as a complementary food and concluded that up to 30% cowpea had no significant adverse effects on sensory qualities. Odedeji, et al. [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] also found that complementary food formulations containing cowpeas and common beans were significantly more liked than formulations containing finger millet and dried peas. The acceptability results here contribute to the feasibility of cowpea for use in complementary feeding. Since maize and cowpea are all locally available and common in rural communities where children are most affected by EED and stunting, advocating in the community for maize porridge fortification with cowpea would seem to be quite achievable. Since none of the processing methods had a negative impact on the acceptability of the cowpea fortified porridge, the most affordable and reliable method of cowpea flour preparation could be pursued in order to make this fortification most widely available for complementary feeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Effect of processing on chemical composition</title><p>The moisture content in all the flours was found to be below the maximum moisture limit for safe storage of 15% [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This low moisture content inhibits microbial growth in the flours [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], thereby extending its shelf life. Even though the process of making dehulled cowpea flour involved soaking in water, the moisture content in the dehulled cowpea flour was not remarkably high, perhaps because dehulling and splitting of the seeds into halves enhanced drying due to the increased surface to volume ratio.</p><p>The slightly lower zinc content observed in dehulled cowpea flour may be a result of soaking, which would allow zinc to leach into the water, as observed previously by Pereira [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, all the cowpea preparation methods would indeed provide a substantial amount of zinc in children&#x02019;s diets, especially considering that the daily recommended intake for children aged 1&#x02013;3 years is 3 mg [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The observed increase in crude fibre following preparation is consistent with prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200418.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which also found an increase in crude fibre following soaking and cooking. The increase could be attributed to the formation of protein-fibre complexes [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] formed after chemical modifications induced by the soaking and cooking [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Though fibre is concentrated in the seed coat, the increase observed in dehulled flour may be a result of the longer soaking time (24 hours) and subsequent boiling. Crude fibre retained in the flours would enhance digestibility and help maintain a healthy gut microbiota, thereby improving overall gut health. Dietary fibre content of the final samples was subsequently evaluated in the United States after the larger clinical trial had begun [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The higher value of measurable flavonoids in roasted cowpea flour may be due to cell wall rupture and the breaking of bonds between antioxidant substances and the tissue matrix [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Heat causes disruption of cell membranes, which releases bound phytochemical compounds such as flavonoids into the medium, making them readily extractable [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that a novel complementary food made by fortification of whole maize flour with three different forms of processed cowpea flours are acceptable by children and their caregivers in rural Malawi. These processing methods also produced flours that retained low moisture content and stable-to-improved zinc, crude fibre, and flavonoid content. Cowpea flour is thus a potential complementary food intervention that could be used towards mitigating stunting and EED in this high-risk population, especially since cowpea is available in Malawi and not entirely unfamiliar to the population. Given the relative simplicity in preparing the roasted cowpea flour and its equivalent nutritional content and acceptability, this novel formulation of complementary food was tested in two prospective, randomized clinical trials among four populations of rural Malawian children [<xref rid="pone.0200418.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Clinical information.</title><p>Baseline clinical and demographic information for subjects enrolled in the acceptability trial.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Clinical and demographic survey in Chichewa.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Acceptability measurement tool for home feeding in Chichewa.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Acceptability measurement tool for observed clinic feeding in Chichewa.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Clinical and demographic survey in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Acceptability measurement tool for home feeding in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s007"><label>S7 File</label><caption><title>Acceptability measurement tool for observed clinic feeding in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s008"><label>S8 File</label><caption><title>Caregiver acceptability measurement tool in Chichewa.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200418.s009"><label>S9 File</label><caption><title>Caregiver acceptability measurement tool in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200418.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0200418.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>National Statistical Office (NSO) [Malawi] and ICF</collab>. <source>Malawi Demographic and Health Survey 2015&#x02013;16</source>. <publisher-loc>Zomba, Malawi, and Rockville, Maryland</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>NSO and ISF</publisher-name>, <year>2017</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0200418.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Owino</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Freemark</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Loy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Manary</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
