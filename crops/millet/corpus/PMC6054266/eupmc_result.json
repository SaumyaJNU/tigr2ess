Six months after APR, she develop a PH with a progressive increase of the size. The patient refused the surgical indication. Thirteen years after APR she presenting with abdominal pain, hematemesis, bilious vomiting and non-functioning of the stoma in the last 2 days. She had a distended and painful abdomen without signs of peritoneal irritation and a large incarcerated PH. CT showed a PH with incarcerated gastric herniation. Endoscopy showed a 4 cm ulcerated lesion in the lesser curvature of the stomach whose posteriorly histopathological study revealed that it was an ischemic ulcer. She was submitted a correction of PH using an onlay polypropylene mesh put around of the previous stoma. The patient has an uneventful recovery and was discharged 3 days later."
