To date, this society has released four such guidelines. Since 2007, the JAS has included objectives that consider all the risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and has accordingly been publishing manuals, such as the &#x0201c;Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases.&#x0201d; Because guidelines should be based on evidence of diagnoses and treatments that have already been validated, regular revisions are necessary to administer medical care of high quality.</p><p>Apart from age, gender, and family history, for which clinical intervention is not possible, the major risk factors for ASCVD include diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia is a huge risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), a form of ASCVD, and in the current set of guidelines, we will be dealing with CAD as the main disease of interest. Nevertheless, other risk factors also ought to be thoroughly managed as part of the efforts for preventing ASCVD.</p><p>In 1987, a consensus conference on hyperlipidemia was held at the JAS, and reference values for diagnosing hyperlipidemia were proposed. Although the reference values were established when there was a lack of evidence in Japan, it was an unprecedented proposal that provided the clinical limits of lipids for the prevention of ASCVD. In 1988, the evidence-based National Cholesterol Program (NCEP) was announced in the United States, and since then, the reference values have undergone several revisions. At that time, there was a strong momentum for the creation of a set of Japan-specific guidelines; therefore, the &#x0201c;Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hyperlipidemia&#x0201d; were established in 1997. Following the publication of epidemiological studies, such as the Hisayama study, and observational studies, such as J-LIT, we gradually gathered sufficient evidence in our country. Subsequently, the &#x0201c;Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases&#x0201d;, which took risk factors into consideration, were established in 2002.</p><p>The &#x0201c;Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases 2007&#x0201d; were later published in 2007. A change of terms from &#x0201c;hyperlipidemia&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;dyslipidemia&#x0201d; and replacement of total cholesterol with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) as the major risk factor were features of this guideline. Establishing LDL-C as the major risk factor has led to an even more direct approach toward managing the risk factors for ASCVD. Furthermore, raising the topic on the importance of measures against metabolic syndrome and smoking, which have gained considerable attention, serves as a reminder to pay attention also to measures for the prevention of ASCVD in our daily lives. For healthy individuals, the risk of ASCVD has traditionally been assessed through the relative risk; however, this was replaced by the use of absolute risk in the guidelines released in 2012. This change resulted in a higher awareness of the importance of combined risk factors. Considering the need to comprehensively manage the wide range of atherosclerotic risks, we have compiled information on the &#x0201c;Comprehensive Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases&#x0201d; and have created charts, which incorporate the guidelines of various scientific societies.</p><p>We have striven to include more updated information in the current revision; hence, you will find several newly introduced Clinical Questions (CQs), which are the mainstream of recent guidelines.</p><p>Shizuya Yamashita</p><p>President, the Japan Atherosclerosis Society</p></sec><sec><title>Key Revisions</title><sec><label>1.</label><title>CQs and Systematic Review (SR)</title><p>In the subsections on dyslipidemia in the assessment of risk factors, absolute risk of ASCVD, lipid management targets as well as drug therapy and diet therapy in improving lifestyle habits, we created CQs and performed an SR based on the MINDS method. For our SR, we essentially chose the literature published before the end of 2015.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Calculation of Absolute Risk</title><p>Following the 2012 version, the assessment of risk has been performed using the absolute risk calculation described in this set of guidelines. The NIPPON DATA80, which was used to calculate the absolute risk in the 2012 version, was the result of baseline surveys conducted when statins were not available. It is suited to the observation of the natural course of disease, and the data are highly useful; however, using death instead of disease onset as the outcome and the absence of information on LDL-C and HDL-C are major issues, in addition to some others. SR indicated that the Suita study, which used CAD as its outcome, is most suitable for risk calculation in this set of guidelines. We believe that the determination of the incidence rate of CAD instead of the overall risk assessment has enabled a clearer demonstration of the importance of each risk.</p></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>Addition of High-Risk Conditions</title><p>In view of the plan to compile an extensive list of risks for atherosclerosis, we included hyperuricemia and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) as conditions to be considered. Although these conditions may contribute to atherosclerotic lesions to different extents, it is necessary to consider them from the perspective of comprehensive management.</p></sec><sec><label>4.</label><title>Stricter LDL-C Control in High-Risk Conditions for Secondary Prevention</title><p>For the secondary prevention of high-risk conditions, such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we proposed an even stricter LDL-C control level than the current LDL-C control level of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><label>5.</label><title>Elaborating on FH</title><p>In conjunction with the launch of new drugs, the addition of pediatric FH as an indication for statins, and so on, we have provided a detailed description of the diagnosis and treatment of FH.

The risk factors need to be managed and treated, with consideration for the prevention of progression and regression of such lesions. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose the extent to which atherosclerosis has progressed.</p><p>Angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and invasive diagnostic methods involving a vascular endoscope are occasionally used for diagnosis in patients who present symptoms and for the secondary prevention of ASCVD. Conversely, non-invasive methods are mainly used for assessing atherosclerosis for the primary prevention of ASCVD in patients who do not present with any symptoms. These non-invasive methods of assessment are generally classified into either morphological examinations [ultrasound, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA)] or vascular function tests [ankle&#x02013;brachial index (ABI), brachial&#x02013;ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), cardio&#x02013;ankle vascular index (CAVI), and flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD)]. We anticipate that carotid intima&#x02013;media thickness (IMT)/plaque, ABI, baPWV, CAVI, and FMD will be useful means for predicting the future risks of ASCVD. In addition, MDCT is a simple and highly specific examination method, which can easily detect coronary lesions. Each patient should be assessed using one or a combination of methods as applicable to his or her condition.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Management</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Risk Assessment and Management</title><p>Assessing each risk factor for atherosclerosis and managing the factors that can be resolved through interventions are important for preventing ASCVD. Evidence from numerous epidemiological studies has revealed many risk factors for atherosclerosis. They include dyslipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), aging, male sex, family history of CAD, history of CAD, non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction, peripheral artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hyperuricemia, and SAS as well as metabolic syndromes that are caused by the accumulation of visceral fats and insulin resistance. Led by The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine, 11 scientific societies and The Japanese Association of Medical Science/Japan Medical Association published the &#x0201c;Comprehensive Risk Management Chart for the Prevention of Cerebro- and Cardiovascular Diseases&#x0201d; in 2015 as a comprehensive set of guidelines for the prevention of ASCVD. The methods of assessment and management were thoroughly explained in six steps in the guidelines, which covered topics from screening (based on the rationale behind the chart) to drug therapy.</p></sec><sec><label>2)</label><title>Diagnostic Criteria and Management Standards for Dyslipidemia</title><p>The incidence of CAD is high when the LDL-C or triglyceride (TG) levels are high or when the HDL-C level is low.

However, this formula cannot be applied if the TG level is 400 mg/dL and greater, or when using postprandial blood. In such cases, non-HDL-C ( = TC&#x02013; HDL-C) shall be used. The accuracy of the LDL-C direct measurement method has improved over time, and it can therefore be used in place of the Friedewald formula.</p><p>In the 2012 version of the guidelines, for primary prevention, patients are stratified based on the absolute risk, and we had established management standards for dyslipidemia, which catered to the stratification. We followed the same plan while formulating the current guidelines and searched for methods of assessment according to absolute risk. Specifically, we formulated the CQ, &#x0201c;Does an assessment method that predicts the incidence of or death due to ASCVD in the Japanese exist?&#x0201d;, and performed an SR. Although nine studies were selected by SR, we eventually chose the Suita study because (1) LDL-C and HDL-C were both included as predictive indicators, (2) the LDL-C levels were categorized in detail, (3) stroke was not included as an endpoint, and (4) the outcome was set as event onset instead of death. We performed the stratification based on the Suita score (<bold><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). As shown in <bold><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>, due to the complexity of calculating the Suita score, we created an application for categorization so that this method can be easily applied in our daily medical practice (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.j-athero.org/publications/gl2017_app.html">http://www.j-athero.org/publications/gl2017_app.html</uri>).

The management targets are challenging goals by utmost effort for patients with low or moderate risk. A 20&#x02013;30% decrease in LDL-C also indicates a reduction in the risk of CAD by 30%; hence, we decided that a reduction of 20&#x02013;30% in LDL-C levels can be considered another target for such patients.

The cessation of smoking is important for preventing atherosclerosis, and controlling the energy intake to reduce obesity would lead to improvements not just in obesity but also in other risk factors. Although a limited number of studies have followed the onset of ASCVD as an endpoint, diet therapy based mainly on the Japanese dietary pattern contributes to decrease risk factors, including improvement of lipid metabolism. In terms of exercise therapy, epidemiological studies have shown that the amount of exercise and level of physical fitness are negatively correlated with CVD, indicating the importance of appropriate exercise.</p></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>Drug Therapy</title><p>Given that statin therapy has been shown to be beneficial for prevention of ASCVD not just overseas but also in Japan, we believe that it is appropriate to consider statins as the first medication of choice for controlling LDL-C levels. In high-risk primary prevention patients, the management target for LDL-C should be &#x0003c; 120 mg/dL. On the other hand, for secondary prevention, aggressive treatment with the aim of lowering LDL-C level at least &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL should be initiated immediately after the disease onset; furthermore, an even lower target value should be considered when patients are complicated with other high risk clinical conditions. The application, effectiveness, and safety of oral hypolipidemic agents other than statins have already been validated; thus, before prescribing them, clinicians should always pay attention to the indications as well as clinical status of contraindication and careful administration. Ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and EPA are the medications that have been proven to be effective for the prevention of ASCVD when used in combination with statins. When prescribing hypolipidemic agents, efforts should be made to improve adherence for medication because good adherence has proven to lead to better efficacy for prevention of ASCVD.</p><p>The effects on plasma lipids' levels of each agent are listed in <bold><xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>. Taking into account of the importance for prevention of ASCVD as well as the attainability of the target level for each lipid through drug therapy, we set the order of intervention starting with LDL-C, followed by non HDL-C and TG. In the main chapter of &#x0201c;Drug Therapy&#x0201d;, we also referred to the significance or meaning of management for hypertriglyceridemia.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Classification of Medications Used to Treat Dyslipidemia According to Their Efficacy</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="middle"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Category</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDL-C</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NonHDL-C</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TG</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HDL-C</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Major drug name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statin</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x0223c;<break/> &#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x0223c;<break/> &#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-&#x0223c;&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pravastatin, Simvastatin, Fluvastatin, Atorvastatin, Pitavastatin, Rosuvastatin</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor (Cholesterol absorption inhibitor)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ezetimibe</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anion exchange resin</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Colestimide, Cholestyramine</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probucol</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probucol</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PCSK9 inhibitor</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x0223c;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;&#x0223c;&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evolocumab, Alirocumab</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MTP inhibitor<xref rid="tf5" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lomitapide</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fibrate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;&#x0223c;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bezafibrate, Fenofibrate, Clinofibrate, Clofibrate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> modulator (SPPARM<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;&#x0223c;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pemafibrate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nicotinic acid derivative</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Niceritrol, Nicomol, Tocopheryl Nicotinate</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02193;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethyl icosapentate, Omega-3-acid ethyl ester</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf5"><label>*</label><p>Applicable only to patients with homozygous FH</p></fn><p>&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;&#x02193;: &#x02264;

In this set of guidelines, we will discuss the guiding principles for treating FH during pregnancy and childbirth and in children.

The treatment for women is basically lifestyle modification, but for secondary prevention patients and patients with FH or at a high risk of CAD, drug therapy shall be considered. It is also important for children to maintain the intake of proper meals and continue with exercise therapy.

However, noninvasive methods are mainly used in primary prevention to assess arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis. In this section, we will be discussing the methods for assessing arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis.</bold></p></disp-quote><sec><label>1.</label><title>Morphological Examinations</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Ultrasonography</title><p>Ultrasonography is a widely used noninvasive imaging method. Lesions in the peripheral arteries, such as the carotid arteries, and arteries in the lower extremities, can be assessed using an ultrasound machine that comes with a high-frequency linear probe of &#x02265; 7 MHz.</p><p>The Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine and The Japan Academy of Neurosonology recommend using ultrasonography as a standard method to measure the intima&#x02013;media thickness (IMT), plaques (localized protruding lesions of &#x02265; 1.1 mm), stenosis and such for assessing the degree of arteriosclerosis, particularly in the carotid arteries<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>. IMT is assessed as the thickness adjusted by age<sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>. It is also used to reflect the degree of systemic arteriosclerosis or as an alternative assessment factor for predicting the risk of co-existence or onset of ASCVD (e.g., CAD, PAD, cerebrovascular diseases, etc.)<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>. Although the presence of plaque has a stronger significance in disease prediction compared to the IMT, a high IMT value in cases where plaques are not detected is the underlying pathogenetic mechanism for the development of plaques. With reference to the Mannheim consensus, it is also necessary to assess the properties of plaques that have a maximum IMT of &#x0003e; 1.5 mm<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>, and assessment is especially important for some plaques that can possibly lead to cerebral embolism (e.g., echolucent plaques, ulcers, mobile lesions, and lipid-rich plaques). If short-axis scanning shows a buildup of plaque in &#x02265; 50% of the vascular lumen, then the degree of stenosis needs to be assessed. When the stenosis is significant (i.e., &#x02265; 70%), in addition to active medical treatment, carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting should also be considered.</p><p>Performing the assessment to determine the properties of the plaques and the percentage of stenosis in the same way as it is done in the carotid arteries is likewise important for arteries in the lower extremities<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>.

It can also determine whether aneurysm is present by measuring the size of the artery. Furthermore, as the degree of calcification, fats, and fiber content can be estimated to some extent based on the CT number, it is an excellent means for confirming the presence of calcified lesions in the aorta and peripheral arteries. Multidetector CT (MDCT) offers superior imaging speed and spatial resolution, and by injecting a contrast medium through the peripheral veins, it enables the visualization of diseases in all the arteries and coronary arteries. It is commonly used to screen for CAD. It has excellent specificity<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup>, and organic coronary stenosis can almost be ruled out if no abnormalities are detected using this technique.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Angiography (MRI/MRA)</title><p>MRI is especially useful for detecting lesions in the brain, which include ischemic changes and cerebral infarction. MRA provides an excellent means for visualizing stenosis and obstructive lesions in the intracranial arteries, carotid arteries, aorta, renal arteries and other blood vessels. Nowadays, non-contrast enhanced MRA is sometimes used in place of angiography. The properties of the plaques can also be assessed using MRI plaque imaging.</p></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>Catheterization</title><p>To date, angiography using a catheter remains as one of the main methods for diagnosing arterial stenosis despite being an invasive examination. Stenotic portions are assessed on the basis of the percentage of stenosis, which is calculated using the luminal diameter of normal-appearing portions and stenotic portions. However, limitations such as eccentric plaques and compensatory remodeling hinder the accurate determination of plaque volume. Meanwhile, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the vascular endoscope are some other methods that provide an excellent assessment of the plaque volume as well as the properties of the plaques.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Vascular Function Tests<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup></title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Ankle&#x02013;Brachial Index (ABI) and Toe&#x02013;Brachial Index (TBI)</title><p>ABI is the ratio of the blood pressure (BP) in the brachial artery to the BP at the ankle joint. This ratio is an indicator of narrowing of the central major arteries from the ankle joint or the presence of obstructive lesions and the degree of compensation by collateral circulation. Methods of measurement include the Doppler technique and the oscilloscope. The Korotkoff sounds should be verified when measuring the BP in the extremities using a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope. On the other hand, the oscillometric method is employed when performing automated measurement using an automated sphygmomanometer or specialized equipment. Although the correlation between both methods is generally good, the precision of the oscillometric method is low when used in cases of critical limb ischemia. If the ABI is &#x02264; 0.9, then the presence of obstructive lesions in the lower extremities should be suspected<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. TBI is the ratio of the BP in the brachial artery to the blood pressure at the toes. Measuring both the ABI and TBI allows us to gauge the peripheral artery obstructive lesions distal than ankle joints. The reference TBI value is &#x02265; 0.7, and the presence of obstructive lesions in the arteries of the lower extremities should be suspected if the resulting value is &#x02264; 0.6. It is necessary to note that diabetes patients and patients undergoing dialysis are prone to calcification in the walls of arteries below the knee, and hence, there are cases in which the ABI cannot be accurately measured.</p></sec><sec><label>2)</label><title>Brachial-Ankle Pulse-Wave Velocity (baPWV)</title><p>The pulse-wave velocity (PWV) produced by cardiac output reflects the stiffness of arteries<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. It can be easily determined by measuring the pulse waves in the extremities using a specialized device. However, it is necessary to note that the PWV is an indicator of arterial stiffness and does not necessarily reflect atherosclerosis. The PWV is the speed at which the aortic vibration (i.e., pulse wave) generated by the beating of the heart is transmitted to the peripheral artery. It is proportionate to the stiffness and thickness of the arterial walls. The carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) and baPWV are the two forms of PWV measurement. baPWV is currently being used in clinical practice in Japan. For baPWV, influences during BP measurement must be taken note of.</p><p>Aging<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup>, hypertension<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup>, diabetes<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup>, and pulse rate<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> are CVD risk factors that have been reported to cause increased baPWV, and they show a good correlation with the Framingham Risk Score.

Arterial elasticity is hardly affected by BP, and stiffness parameter <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> has been designed as an index of arterial elasticity that is corrected using BP during measurement. It is calculated using the formula ln (Ps/Pd)/[(Ds-Dd)/Dd], with BP and changes in carotid artery caliber as the variables<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</sup>. Additionally, it has been reported that stiffness parameter <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> is correlated with carotid atherosclerosis<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>The CAVI is an index that represents the elasticity of the entire artery, from its aortic root to the ankle, and it is derived by applying the concept of the stiffness parameter <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> to the long arteries. A feature of CAVI is its nondependence on BP during measurement<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)</sup>. The CAVI increases with age<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)</sup>, and patients with cerebral infarction, CVD<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</sup>, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and vasculitis have high CAVI values. It is also increased in patients who suffer from hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), smoking, stress caused by disasters, etc., but at the same time, it has been reported that the CAVI improves with treatment of these contributing factors<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</sup>. Prospective surveys on cardiovascular events have revealed that a high CAVI value is associated with a high frequency of cardiovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to these, the central BP is also an index that reflects vascular function.</p></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>Vascular Endothelial Function</title><p>Reactive hyperemia following a 5-minute avascularization in the forearm and certain drugs such as acetylcholine cause a vascular endothelium-dependent increase in blood flow, and vascular endothelial function is assessed by measuring the resulting increase in arterial diameter and blood flow. The first method of assessment is strain-gauge plethysmography, which measures the changes in circumference of the extremities as the arterial pulse is produced. The second method is flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), in which the changes in diameter of arteries in the upper arm are measured by ultrasonography. FMD is a test that assesses the extent of brachial artery dilation caused by reactive hyperemia after 5 minutes of forearm ischemia. The formula used for calculation is FMD (%) = (diameter of the most dilated blood vessel - resting blood vessel diameter)/resting blood vessel diameter &#x000d7; 100. The normal FMD value is &#x02265; 6&#x02013;7%, and a malfunction in the endothelial cells results in poor production of nitric oxide (NO), which in turn lowers the amount of FMD. FMD starts decreasing from early stages of arteriosclerosis<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)</sup>, and it is therefore useful for the initial assessment of ASCVD.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>Predicting the Risk for ASCVD by Assessing Arterial Walls</title><p>It has been reported that IMT/plaque of carotid artery, ABI, baPWV, CAVI, FMD, and such are independent predictive factors of future risk for ASCVD. However, reports of other countries have revealed that adding the result of IMT measurement does not increase the ability of risk prediction by the Framingham Risk Score<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)</sup>. Although there are reports on the significance of noninvasive arterial wall assessment in Japan<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)</sup>, there is still a lack of sufficient evidence. Recent reports by Japan have shown that<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)</sup> when data from a meta-analysis that integrated personal-level data of 14,673 Japanese was used, the addition of baPWV to the classic risk factors increased the ability to predict the risk for CVD. These reports have particularly demonstrated the usefulness of baPWV in risk prediction for low-risk groups. In addition, it is suggested that a baPWV &#x0003e; 1,800 cm/s is a risk that is equivalent to the high-risk conditions<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. However, baPWV that reflects a high risk may possibly be different in the target group, and further accumulation of data would be advantageous. To indicate the abnormal findings of these indices except ABI in the risk categories in this set of guidelines, which will lead to stricter management, more evidence needs to be built.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>Chapter 3.</label><title>Comprehensive Risk Assessment</title><sec><label>1.</label><title>Risk Factor Assessment</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Dyslipidemia</title><disp-quote><p><bold>CQ1.

Furthermore, there have been many reports on hypertriglyceridemia being a risk factor for ischemic stroke, though the association is weaker than that with CAD<sup><xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Considering the above findings, hypertriglyceridemia has been defined as a TG level of &#x02265; 150 mg/dL in these guidelines. However, hypertriglyceridemia often comes with other important implications, such as an increase in the amount of remnant lipoproteins or small dense LDL and the co-existence of hypo-HDL cholesterolemia. It could also be a finding of metabolic syndrome, and hence, other factors accompanying an elevated TG level should also be thoroughly considered.</p><sec><title>Diagnostic Criteria for Dyslipidemia</title><p>As mentioned in CQ1 to CQ5, the positive correlation between a higher incidence rate of CAD and high levels of LDL-C, TC, non-HDL-C and TG, or low levels of HDL-C, has been shown not just in epidemiological surveys conducted in Europe and the US but also in Japan. Among the different types of stroke, the association with cerebral infarction has been found to be almost similar to that with CAD. However, for hemorrhagic stroke (primarily intracerebral hemorrhage), the incidence and mortality rates are instead higher at low LDL-C and TC levels. At present, the absolute risk of CAD (incidence and mortality rate) in Japan is very much lower than that in the Western countries<sup><xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>)</sup>. However, there have been reports and such revealing that the LDL-C and TC levels of the Japanese have been on the rise because of recent westernization of lifestyle habits. As a result of this change, the TC levels of the Japanese have already reached the levels in the US, or even higher<sup><xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>)</sup>. These reports have also pointed out the increasing incidence rate of CAD in some regions in Japan<sup><xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>)</sup>, and this is why the management of dyslipidemia is of importance. In these guidelines, we have therefore established the diagnostic criteria for dyslipidemia with a focus on preventing the development of CAD. The diagnostic criteria are shown in <bold><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>.</p><p>The sequence of diagnosis is to first measure the TC, TG and HDL-C levels in a fasting state in the morning and subsequently calculating the LDL-C level using the Friedewald formula (LDL-C = TC&#x02013;HDL-C&#x02013;TG/5). However, measurement using the direct method is also allowed. Even though problems with the accuracy of the direct method have been pointed out<sup><xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>)</sup>, there have recently been the discontinuation of sales and production, improvement and revision of standard pricing of reagents that were found to be mediocre over time. As a result of the improved performance of reagents, the validity of LDL-C measurement within daily clinical practice has been substantiated<sup><xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>)</sup>. However, most of the studies providing evidence relating to the treatment of hyper-LDL cholesterolemia have used the Friedewald formula to determine LDL-C levels. It should be noted that the diagnostic criteria, treatment targets and such are based on the Friedewald formula. Non-HDL-C or the direct method of LDL-C measurement is used when the patient is in a nonfasting state or when the TG level is &#x02265; 400 mg/dL. However, the accuracy of the direct method and the non-HDL-C calculation cannot be guaranteed when the TG level is &#x02265; 1000 mg/dL<sup><xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>)</sup> and &#x02265; 600 mg/dL, respectively.

An estimated GFR (eGFR) is used for GFR. CKD is not merely a highrisk condition for end-stage kidney disease but also for ASCVD.

The Japanese Society of Nephrology recommends the following criteria for referral to nephrologists: (1) advanced proteinuria (urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of &#x02265; 0.50 g/gCr or &#x02265; 2+ by dipstick test), (2) both urinary protein and urinary blood are positive (&#x02265; 1 + by dipstick test) and (3) eGFR &#x0003c; 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>

There are reports in Japan stating that a significant association was seen between hs-CRP and stroke (especially cerebral infarction and lacunar infarction)<sup><xref rid="bib280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>)</sup>. hs-CRP has also been associated with the onset risk of MI and stroke, of which the association is particularly strong in MI<sup><xref rid="bib281" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>)</sup>. Conversely, in a study on the genotype related to CRP concentration in the blood and the frequency of CAD, there was no association between the concentration of CRP and the frequency of CAD<sup><xref rid="bib282" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>)</sup>. This result suggests that the concentration of CRP is probably not a cause of ASCVD but instead reflects the extent to which atherosclerosis has progressed. Pentraxin (PTX)-3 belongs to the same pentraxin family of proteins as CRP. Unlike CRP, which is found in the liver, PTX-3 is specifically expressed in the endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and WBCs. Recent reports have suggested that the association of CRP and PTX-3 in coronary artery plaques in pathological autopsies shows that both CRP and PTX-3 reflect unstable plaques. However, the distributions of CRP and PTX-3 in the plaques are not the same, and there is a possibility that they play different roles. There have also been reports on the PTX-3-lowering effect of statins. PTX-3 is expected to serve as a specific marker reflecting CVD in the future<sup><xref rid="bib283" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib286" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><label>ix)</label><title>Homocysteine</title><p>The elevation of homocysteine concentration in the blood has been reported to be a risk factor not just for CAD but also for stroke and PAD<sup><xref rid="bib287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib289" ref-type="bibr">289</xref>)</sup>. In a study involving elderly individuals who were aged &#x02265; 85 years and had no history of cardiovascular disease, a high homocysteine concentration in the blood increased the relative risk for MI<sup><xref rid="bib290" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>)</sup>.

Furthermore, it has also been reported that there is no association between ASCVD and hereditary genetic mutations that cause an increase in homocysteine levels<sup><xref rid="bib294" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>)</sup>. In a meta-analysis related to the risk for CAD at a young age, the effect of homocysteine was not seen in all subjects.

The background for this finding has been suggested to be the relatively lower intake of folic acid by Asians than that by other races, and this implies a need to study hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor in Japan. The various genetic polymorphisms affecting homocysteine concentration have been evaluated in studies that involved individuals of European descent, using genome-wide association study.

The NIPPON DATA80 had various advantages, including the fact that groups were selected from all over Japan by random sampling, the chart was based on a baseline survey conducted before statins were available and its high suitability for the observation of the natural course of disease, making it very useful for the assessment of absolute risk. However, some aspects of NIPPON DATA80 are problematic such as (1) the fact that its predicted outcome is death and not CAD incidence, (2) the fact that it does not include information on LDL-C or HDL-C and (3) the fact that the baseline year is 1980, and when this baseline hazard is applied to more recent cohort populations, the estimated mortality of the high-risk group is higher than the actual measured mortality of recent populations<sup><xref rid="bib341" ref-type="bibr">341</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Like the NIPPON DATA80 survey, the Ibaraki Prefectural Health Study used death as the outcome. The other seven articles selected for review used disease incidence as the outcome. Stroke was the outcome in two articles; MI in two; and CAD, combined CAD and stroke, and CAD or cerebral infarction in one article each. Hardly any cohort studies conducted in Japan have demonstrated that dyslipidemia was a risk factor for stroke<sup><xref rid="bib342" ref-type="bibr">342</xref>)</sup>, and hypercholesterolemia (e.g., TC or non-HDL-C) was not included as a risk factor in any of the assessment tool in which the outcome was stroke or cerebral infarction. In addition, absolute risk was assessed over 5 years in two of the reviewed articles and 10 years in the other seven. Furthermore, only two articles included both MI and coronary intervention as the outcomes, which also included both LDL-C and HDL-C as predictive indicators, i.e., important risk factors for establishing the management targets for dyslipidemia. Accordingly, we concluded that the Hisayama score<sup><xref rid="bib334" ref-type="bibr">334</xref>)</sup> and the Suita score<sup><xref rid="bib162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>)</sup> include the most suitable criteria for assessment of absolute risk relevant to the primary prevention of ASCVD in Japanese adults by managing dyslipidemia. The biggest difference between these risk assessment tools is the fact that the Suita score considers only CAD (MI, PCI, coronary artery bypass, and sudden cardiac death), whereas the Hisayama score considers a combined outcome of CAD, with diagnostic criteria nearly the same as the Suita score, and stroke. In both scores, the fasting LDL-C value is calculated using the Friedewald formula. Stroke comprises a large proportion of the cases of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease in Japan. The ratio of stroke to CAD in the Hisayama study was approximately 2: 1; however, among stroke cases, the percentage of atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease in which LDL-C was a risk factor is approximately 20%<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, it is difficult to determine detailed risk by LDL-C level with the Hisayama score, as it uses a combined outcome. The Suita score permits detailed risk assessment by specific dyslipidemia values because it includes five LDL-C level criteria in contrast to the Hisayama score, which includes two levels.</p></sec><sec><label>2)</label><title>Management of Dyslipidemia Using Absolute Risk</title><p>The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines<sup><xref rid="bib343" ref-type="bibr">343</xref>)</sup> recommended avoiding setting an LDL-C control target and using statins to treat four groups of patients for whom they are considered beneficial. The JAS position on those guidelines, published as a press release in February 2014, is that having a management target is advisable in clinical practice in Japan from the viewpoint of patient adherence. Many practicing clinicians use management targets as treatment references, and our view is that their use should be continued. The 2016 European Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias published in August 2016 continue to require the use of a management target<sup><xref rid="bib344" ref-type="bibr">344</xref>)</sup>. We have also included management targets in the management of ASCVD with absolute risk in this revision of the guidelines.</p><p>As the threshold of each risk grade cannot be determined statistically by using the absolute risk, the criteria were based on clinical consensus and social conventions. In the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) &#x02162; guidelines of the USA, a &#x02265; 20% 10-year risk of incidence of fatal CAD and nonfatal MI based on the Framingham Score was considered high risk. However, this cannot be used in Japan because ASCVD types and incidence rates of ASCVD differ from those in the USA. The aforementioned 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines, based on novel pooled risk calculations, recommend statins for anyone with a predicted 10-year incidence of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease (CAD and stroke) of &#x02265; 7.5%<sup><xref rid="bib333" ref-type="bibr">333</xref>)</sup> which, however, is a rough indication to select the patients to for statin therapy. We have not accumulated enough evidence from clinical studies in Japan to establish a similar reference for selecting patients for statin therapy. Our society's guidelines must maintain continuity and consistency with the risk categorization used in our guidelines before. Management targets for dyslipidemia are also provided in the 2015 Comprehensive Risk Management Chart for the Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases jointly published by 13 academic societies, including JAS and the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine<sup><xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>)</sup>. We considered these recent changes in existing recommendations when creating this set of guidelines and established risk categories and lipid-management targets.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>CAD Risk Categories</title><p>In the 2012 version of our guidelines, the NIPPON DATA80 risk chart was the basis for categorizing absolute risk. While the chart detail allows to determine detailed individual risk, it is complex in appearance. The guidelines published in 2007, were simple and convenient to use, but risk categorization depended on a number of risk factors other than LDL-C. Application of the 2007 guidelines results in lack of association with absolute risk because of the huge influence of age and sex. The effect of age is especially substantial. This means that the estimated absolute risk is low in young people even with multiple risk factors and high in older individuals even with few risk factors. Therefore, reference material 2 of the 2012 guidelines (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.j-athero.org/publications/gl2012_114.pdf">http://www.j-athero.org/publications/gl2012_114.pdf</uri>) notes that the number of risk factors can be used in estimates of absolute risk if sex and age taken into account. Accordingly, we presented two types of flowchart for determining the lipid-management target; one uses an absolute risk calculation by the Suita score and the other uses the number of risk factors, consistent with the Comprehensive Risk Management Chart for the Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases 2015.</p><p><bold><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold> shows the flowchart using the absolute risk derived from the Suita score. When screening for dyslipidemia, whether patients are candidates for secondary prevention is first confirmed. Next, whether these patients have a high-risk condition such as diabetes (not including impaired glucose tolerance), CKD, non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction, or PAD is evaluated. The Suita score calculation is performed in patients with none of these conditions. Diabetes and CKD are included in the original Suita score; but they are not used in calculating the score here as they would already have been treated as high-risk conditions. If the patient has a family history of premature CAD, i.e., first-degree relatives with incidence before 55 years of age for men or 65 years of age for women, or impaired glucose tolerance, it is assumed that they have a risk equivalent to smoking or low HDL-C; five points is added to the Suita score. The predictive model for CAD incidence based on the Suita score is shown in <bold><xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>.</p><p>In terms of the probability of CAD incidence, apart from the lowest risk category (&#x02264; 35), the minimum value of score range is shown as an integer in each risk category in the original article of the Suita score. In this guideline, ranges (smallest score-highest score) and the median of risk scores are shown in each category. For consistency with the absolute risk assessment by NIPPON DATA80 used in the 2012 guidelines, the absolute risk of CAD is classified by scores &#x02264; 40 as low (a 10-year probability of CAD incidence of &#x0003c; 2%), 41&#x02013;55 as moderate (2&#x02013;8%), or &#x02265; 56 as high (&#x02265; 9%). Committee members have confirmed that the distribution of low risk, moderate risk, and high risk individuals in two different populations is almost identical to the distribution of categories &#x02160;, &#x02161;, and &#x02162; calculated by the NIPPON DATA80 as in the 2012 guidelines.</p><p>On the other hand, determination of the risk for each sex and age group (i.e., age 40&#x02013;59 and 60&#x02013;74 years) is easily achieved with the Comprehensive Risk Management Chart for the Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases 2015. Using that categorization, we estimated the actual absolute risk of CAD using the Suita score (i.e., the LDL model). We made a few changes to make the evaluation easier. We adopted the Suita score age groups of 45&#x02013;54 years in place of 40&#x02013;59 years and 65&#x02013;69 years in place of 60&#x02013;74 years. Smoking, hypertension, and low HDL-C were added as risk factors. We used the median Suita hypertension scores of grade 1 and &#x02265; grade 2, and we increased the number of points awarded to the low HDL-C category (&#x0003c; 40 mg/dL) compared with the 40&#x02013;59 mg/dL category. All were awarded five points. An LDL-C level of &#x02265; 180 mg/dL has always indicated a high risk for CAD, and may also suggest the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Therefore, these guidelines clearly recommend drug therapy for patients with an LDL-C level &#x02265; 180 mg/dL regardless of the number of other risk factors. A flowchart of the recommended LDL-C management target based on the number of risk factors is shown in <bold><xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>. The flowchart conforms to the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk criteria of the simplified Comprehensive Risk Management Chart for the Prevention of Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases 2015. However, if the estimation is performed on the basis of the Suita score, the distribution is 39&#x02013;41 points for the low-risk, 42&#x02013;56 points for the moderate-risk, and 49&#x02013;71 points for the high-risk groups. Overlapping of groups is unavoidable, but considered acceptable in this simplified method. In addition, a family history of premature CAD, which is absent in the Suita score, and impaired glucose tolerance are considered to carry the same level of risk as the other factors included in the assessment method and are therefore also counted as risk factors. A management target that corresponds to the respective risk level, from low to high, is identified and compared with the actual lipid level. If the target has not been achieved, the aim of lowering is set.</p><p>As the risk of CAD changes with age and risk factor status, the management category should be reassessed at least once per year according to the most recent test findings. In addition, the risk scores have been basically created assuming that they apply to patients with risk factors, including dyslipidemia, that are not being treated. Two scores from the Japan Health Center Study took into account patients with or without antihypertensive drugs for blood pressure control<sup><xref rid="bib339" ref-type="bibr">339</xref>, <xref rid="bib340" ref-type="bibr">340</xref>)</sup>. However, no risk scores that consider whether the patient is taking any medicines for control of dyslipidemia or diabetes are available in Japan, the USA, or Europe. The currently available risk scoring tools can be used even if the patient is on medication, but the actual risks of cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases differ in patients with or without antihypertensive drug treatment. Usually patients whose blood pressure cannot be controlled by lifestyle modification are medicated and their risk of cerebro-and cardiovascular diseases are lowered by medication. However, as their blood pressure are assumed to remained high for long time before medicated, it is difficult to lower their risk to the same level of those who are not medicated. If they both have the same blood pressure, then the patient on medication is at a higher risk<sup><xref rid="bib345" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>)</sup>. It should be kept in mind that the actual risk of disease in patients on medication may be higher than the risk indicated by the prediction score.</p><p>The incidence of CAD differs in the various regions and populations in Japan, and is higher in cities than in rural areas<sup><xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>)</sup>, and employees of large companies have an extremely low incidence rate of MI compared to the general population<sup><xref rid="bib346" ref-type="bibr">346</xref>)</sup>. The NIPPON DATA80 outcome was the number of deaths in populations that were selected by stratified random sampling from all regions of Japan and should be representative of the general population. There are doubts as to whether the absolute risk assessed using the Suita score is also representative of the general population of Japan. The incidence of CAD is likely to be higher in the Suita study than in other regional cohort studies and it differs from many other regional cohort studies in the use of coronary intervention as one of outcomes. Consequently, the estimated absolute risk for CAD may be much higher than in other regional cohort studies. In Japan, the Hisayama score is the only other method in which coronary intervention is also assessed as an outcome, and coronary intervention is not used for an outcome in the scoring system of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines in the USA<sup><xref rid="bib333" ref-type="bibr">333</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>Management Targets for Dyslipidemia from the Perspective of Preventing CAD</title><p>The category-specific dyslipidemia management targets are shown in <bold><xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>. For primary prevention, drug therapy should be considered after lifestyle modifications have been applied for 3&#x02013;6 months and when the effects have been ascertained. However, for patients in any of the risk categories, including the low-risk category, if the LDL-C level remains at &#x02265; 180 mg/dL, then the addition of drug therapy and lifestyle modifications can both be considered. The validity of an LDL-C management target has been partially confirmed by the systematic review data (see Chapter 4, CQ17). The management targets for high-risk category is &#x0003c; 120 mg/dL, and for the the low-risk and moderate-risk groups are the same as in the previous guidelines, i.e., &#x0003c; 160 mg/dL and &#x0003c; 140 mg/dL, respectively. Achieving these management targets is challenging. The results of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving the use of statins revealed that a 20&#x02013;30% decrease in LDL-C level lowers the risk for CAD by approximately 30%<sup><xref rid="bib347" ref-type="bibr">347</xref>, <xref rid="bib348" ref-type="bibr">348</xref>)</sup>. Considering long-term effects and safety, a reduction rate of 20&#x02013;30% in the LDL-C level can also be used as a target for the low-risk and moderate-risk groups. However, this management target cannot be applied to patients with FH or familial type &#x02162; hyperlipidemia. As patients with FH are difficult to treat, and their risk of CAD in the future is extremely high, it is recommended that these patients be referred to a specialist (see Chapter 5, Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Capter6, Other Types of Primary Dyslipidemias).</p><p>This set of guidelines was developed for use in adults aged &#x0003c; 75 years of age. The advantages and disadvantages of lipid management in patients aged &#x0003c; 40 years of age are at the discretion of the attending physician; however, if lipid management is to be carried out, then the Suita score absolute risk for 35&#x02013;44 years of age group is used.</p><p>As patients with a history of CAD most likely require more aggressive treatment for secondary prevention, they are managed differently than patients in need of primary prevention. The LDL-C management target for secondary prevention should be set at a lower value than for primary prevention. Large clinical studies conducted in Western countries have shown that lowering the mean pretreatment LDL-C level decreases the risk of recurrence and total mortality of CAD and it is also effective in decreasing stroke incidence. Observational studies and clinical trials conducted in Japan found that the decrease in frequency of recurrence was proportional to the decrease in LDL-C level until it reached a level of 100 mg/dL. Consequently, by means of drug therapy together with lifestyle modification, the LDL-C management target for secondary prevention shall be at &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL; however, if a level of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL is difficult to achieve, the target shall be a 50% reduction in the LDL-C level.</p><p>As in the previous guidelines, during secondary prevention, if non-cardiogenic cerebral infarction, PAD, CKD, or metabolic syndrome are also present or if the patient has multiple risk factors or is still smoking, it is advisable to make it mandatory to achieve an LDL-C level of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL considering the higher risk. Some reports in Japan have also indicated the usefulness of controlling the LDL-C level to &#x0003c; 70 mg/dL for a regressive effect on coronary plaques in patients complicated with ACS or diabetes mellitus. In view of the extremely high risk of CAD with FH, if the patient's condition is complicated with FH or ACS, then it would be appropriate to consider stricter lipid management with a target LDL-C level of &#x0003c; 70 mg/dL and a non-HDL-C level of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL during secondary prevention. In addition, because diabetic patients who are complicated with conditions shown in <bold><xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3b</xref></bold> had a high risk for recurrence of CAD, their management target should be set as that of ACS or FH (see Chapter 4.4-1 &#x02018;History of CAD&#x02019; for details).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Patient Conditions that Require Stricter Management in Secondary Prevention</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody valign="middle"><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">a</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes mellitus (DM)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">b</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Noncardiogenic cerebral infarction</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peripheral artery disease (PAD)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic kidney disease (CKD)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Metabolic syndrome</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overlap of major risk factors</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smoking</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Although management targets for each lipid of concern in dyslipidemia have been established, the primary objective should be the achievement of the LDL-C management target. The non-HDL-C targets can be reviewed when the LDL-C target has been achieved. NCEP-ATP III guidelines recommend a non-HDL-C target 30 mg/dL higher than that of LDL-C, similar to the guidelines in Japan<sup><xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>)</sup>. We thus include a non-HDL-C management target that is 30 mg/dL higher than the LDL-C target in this set of guidelines. If the TG level is &#x02265; 400 mg/dL, or if blood is collected after a meal, then the non-HDL-C target shall be used for the initial management of dyslipidemia instead of the LDL-C target. If non-HDL-C levels are used for screening in the general population, then it should also be noted that the difference between the non-HDL-C and LDL-C levels would be &#x0003c; 30 mg/dL, at approximately 20 mg/dL<sup><xref rid="bib349" ref-type="bibr">349</xref>, <xref rid="bib350" ref-type="bibr">350</xref>)</sup>. As in the previous guidelines, a TG level of &#x0003c; 150 mg/dL and an HDL-C level of &#x02265; 40 mg/dL are the recommended targets for both primary and secondary prevention. Even if the LDL-C management target has been achieved, a high non-HDL-C level may be accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, and management of this condition is important. Few available medications are effective for increasing low HDL-C, and some reports have found that CAD risk is low if a low HDL level is not accompanied by other lipid abnormalities<sup><xref rid="bib351" ref-type="bibr">351</xref>)</sup>. On the basis of this evidence, the approach for managing HDL-C, should basically involve lifestyle modification after management of LDL-C, non-HDL-C and TG levels.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Lifestyle Modification</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Overview of Lifestyle Modification</title><p>ASCVD is developed by various environmental factors such as excessive total energy intake and insufficient physical activity in addition to genetic predisposition. Many epidemiological studies in Japan and other countries have revealed that excessive intake of cholesterol and animal fats (saturated fatty acids) results in increased serum LDL-C levels. Excessive total energy intake and insufficient physical activity are the primary causes of metabolic syndrome, inducing the accumulation of visceral fat, abnormal glucose metabolism, elevated blood pressure and increased triglyceride levels, and decreased HDL-C levels. These lifestyle abnormalities result in ASCVD such as myocardial infarction. Therefore, the basic management to prevent ASCVD is the adoption of lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation and avoiding passive smoking, achieving and maintaining an appropriate body weight by re-evaluating total energy intake and physical activity, adhering to traditional Japanese dietary pattern with a low salt content, refraining from excessive alcohol intake, and performing aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes per day.

The importance of the comprehensive management of overlapping complicating risk factors in addition to LDL-C, such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, was affirmed in this study. Furthermore, for diabetes patients, who are a high-risk group in primary prevention, a sub-analysis of the J-LIT study results found that keeping the LDL-C level &#x0003c; 120 mg/dL was useful for preventing CAD incidence<sup><xref rid="bib625" ref-type="bibr">625</xref>)</sup>. The HOPE-3 study was a randomized comparative intervention trial of statins for primary prevention in populations with characteristics corresponding to high risk in Japan.

An assessment of individual risk should include this information when drug therapy is considered for patients with high absolute risk. The long-term follow-up of large clinical trials of statins that were conducted in the 1990s, such as the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) and the Heart Protection Study (HPS)<sup><xref rid="bib628" ref-type="bibr">628</xref>, <xref rid="bib629" ref-type="bibr">629</xref>)</sup> confirmed that early initiation of LDLC-lowering therapy regardless of the plasma LDL-C level was useful for the long-term prevention of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in high-risk patients. No increases in new-incidence cancer or non-CVD deaths were observed, which reconfirms the safety of long-term LDL-C-lowering therapy using statins.</p><p>Lifetime cumulative LDL-C and the threshold for CAD incidence are recent concepts. Aggressive LDL-C-lowering therapy is recommended as early as possible for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who present with hyper-LDL cholesterolemia at a young age followed by developing the premature CAD. Cardiovascular events may occur sooner than expected in patients with usual hyper-LDL cholesterolemia because of the accumulation of LDL-C that is promoted by complicating atherosclerosis risk factors.

There is a need to consider LDL-C-lowering therapy as soon as possible for hyper-LDL cholesterolemic patients with high absolute risk.

However, there are no lipid intervention studies that have set an LDL-C management target. Therefore, when LDL-C-lowering therapy is given to prevent cardiovascular events, the question of whether to &#x0201c;treat to target&#x0201d; or to use a potent statin without setting a target value i.e., &#x0201c;fire and forget&#x0201d; is under debate. Currently, it is necessary to consider the results of epidemiological studies and cohort studies to choose the LDL-C management target. In a long-term Japanese observational study of secondary prevention, the incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly decreased in patients whose LDL-C levels were controlled at &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL<sup><xref rid="bib632" ref-type="bibr">632</xref>)</sup>. In the CREDO-Kyoto Registry Cohort-2, the 3-year incidence of cardiovascular events in patients treated with potent and standard statins were compared. Patients underwent analysis stratified by LDL-C management level<sup><xref rid="bib633" ref-type="bibr">633</xref>)</sup>. The incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly lower with the potent statin than with the standard statin. In addition, in patients with LDL-C levels &#x02265; 120 mg/dL, the risk of the incidence of cardiovascular events was 1.74 times greater than in patients with LDL-C levels of 80&#x02013;99 mg/dL, which was a significant difference. A significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular events was not seen when the LDL-C level was &#x0003c; 80 mg/dL. The mean LDL-C levels that were analyzed by the strength of statin were 92 mg/dL in patients treated with potent statins and 101 mg/dL in patients with standard statins, respectively. The study outcome supports the benefits of controlling the LDL-C level at &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL rather than basing the treatment on the strength of statin. It has been reported that the risk of cardiovascular events increased in patients with the escape phenomenon (i.e., re-elevation in LDL-C level of &#x02265; 10% after a reduction) following the start of statin treatment<sup><xref rid="bib634" ref-type="bibr">634</xref>)</sup>. However, patients with the escape phenomenon had an LDL-C level of 106 mg/dL; whereas the comparison group had an LDL-C level of 90 mg/dL. In addition to the choosing the strength of the statin, regular blood testing to monitor the LDL-C level is recommended. A recent survey in Japan, found that 65% patients with ACS, and 55% for other secondary prevention patients, achieved an LDL-C management target of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL. Thus, LDL-C management with lipid-lowering therapy for secondary prevention in Japan is still not satisfactory<sup><xref rid="bib626" ref-type="bibr">626</xref>)</sup>.

A meta-analysis of clinical trials that combined primary and secondary prevention has revealed a linear relationship between the LDL-C level following statin treatment and the suppressive effects of statins on cardiovascular events. A review performed outside of Japan reported that larger suppressive effects on cardiovascular events can be achieved by maintaining the LDL-C level at &#x0003c; 50 mg/dL<sup><xref rid="bib646" ref-type="bibr">646</xref>)</sup>. We consider these findings to be supportive of the hypothesis of &#x0201c;lower is better.&#x0201d; As FH puts the patient at extremely high risk for CAD, it is likely that the risk in primary prevention is equivalent to that in secondary prevention. Therefore, in secondary prevention complicated with FH or ACS, stricter LDL-C management to achieve a level &#x0003c; 70 mg/dL can be considered appropriate. The secondary prevention for DM patients complicated with conditions described in <bold><xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3b</xref></bold>, should also be treated based on the target level of FH or ACS, as they are considered to be at high risk of recurrence of CAD.

Meanwhile, the co-administration of a nicotinic acid derivative (niacin) and statin to increase HDL-C levels did not have a suppressive effect on cardiovascular events in the AIM-HIGH<sup><xref rid="bib653" ref-type="bibr">653</xref>)</sup> and HPS2-THRIVE<sup><xref rid="bib654" ref-type="bibr">654</xref>)</sup> studies.</p><p>Therefore, we cannot confirm that drugs for hypertriglyceridemia, such as fibrates and nicotinic acid derivatives, have a preventive effect on ASCVD.

In addition, we should consider the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with markedly increased fasting TG levels (500 mg/dL or higher) and consider the concurrent administration of fibrates or other drugs with dietary advice.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>Characteristics and Criteria for Selecting the Various Drugs</title><disp-quote><p><bold>Q2.

These are drugs for which the effects have been ascertained through double-blind studies completed in Japan. There is a need to select safe and effective medications based on understanding of the characteristics of various drugs, while taking into account any complicating diseases, drug interactions, etc. The characteristics of various drugs used to treat dyslipidemia are described below.</p><sec><label>i)</label><title>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins): Pravastatin, Simvastatin, Fluvastatin, Atorvastatin, Pitavastatin, and Rosuvastatin</title><p>Statins are indicated for cases of dyslipidemia with a high LDL-C level. They are currently one of the most effective medications for lowering the LDL-C level and have been so because their effects on FH were shown<sup><xref rid="bib656" ref-type="bibr">656</xref>)</sup>. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, in turn suppressing cholesterol biosynthesis<sup><xref rid="bib657" ref-type="bibr">657</xref>)</sup>. The subsequent activation of SREBP2 promotes LDL receptor synthesis and results in a reduction in the blood LDL-C level<sup><xref rid="bib658" ref-type="bibr">658</xref>)</sup>. The range of the LDL-C-lowering effect is 20%&#x02013;50%. Although a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver also results in a decrease in the TG level through simultaneous suppression of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and secretion<sup><xref rid="bib659" ref-type="bibr">659</xref>)</sup>, the decrease ranges from approximately 10%&#x02013;20%. Myopathy-like symptoms, such as hepatic disorders, an increased creatine kinase (CK) level, and muscular weakness, have been reported as adverse reactions to statins. Rhabdomyolysis, characterized by an increased myoglobin level in the blood and urine, has also been reported, though this complication is very rare. Rhabdomyolysis risk increases with the combined use of statins with fibrates, nicotinic acid derivatives, cyclosporine, or erythromycin, etc. Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, characterized by muscle fiber necrosis without infiltration of inflammatory cells on histological examination and the positivity for anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibodies on serological examination, has also been reported even in Japan<sup><xref rid="bib660" ref-type="bibr">660</xref>, <xref rid="bib661" ref-type="bibr">661</xref>)</sup>. The symptoms which are characterized by muscle weakness predominantly in proximal muscle and marked muscle pain with an increased CK level, persist even after stopping administration of oral statins, and there have been cases in which symptoms progress rapidly. Administration of oral statins should therefore be stopped immediately if myopathy-like symptoms appear and the patient's condition should be monitored closely.</p><p>Moreover, there have been reports on suspected teratogenicity in pregnant patients who incidentally took statins during early pregnancy<sup><xref rid="bib662" ref-type="bibr">662</xref>)</sup>; therefore, at present, it appears that statins must not be used in women who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, trying to conceive, or lactating. Pitavastatin (1&#x02013;2 mg) has been approved for pediatric FH in patients aged &#x02265; 10 years.</p></sec><sec><label>ii)</label><title>Intestinal Cholesterol Transporter Inhibitor (Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor): Ezetimibe</title><p>Ezetimibe inhibits a small intestine cholesterol transporter (NPC1L1) that exists in the small intestinal mucosa and controls the absorption of cholesterol derived from diet and bile in the small intestine, thereby exerting a blood cholesterol-lowering effect<sup><xref rid="bib663" ref-type="bibr">663</xref>)</sup>. Unlike resins, this drug is absorbed into the body. After passing through the intestinal circulatory system, approximately 78% of it is excreted in the feces. Because this drug selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption, it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A and D. The usual oral dose (10 mg/day) decreases the LDL-C level by approximately 18%. Similar to resins, it enhances cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Therefore, the combined use of ezetimibe with statins is ideal and provides a synergistic effect: combination therapy with 10 mg of ezetimibe and a statin at the usual dose decreases the LDL-C level by approximately 35&#x02013;50%<sup><xref rid="bib664" ref-type="bibr">664</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib666" ref-type="bibr">666</xref>)</sup>, which is equivalent to the effects achieved using a maximum statin dose alone. A meta-analysis of large-scale clinical trials involving combination therapy with ezetimibe and statins in patients with high-risk conditions such as FH, ACS, and PAD, confirmed the safety of combination therapy and cardiovascular event suppression resulting from its LDL-C-lowering effects<sup><xref rid="bib667" ref-type="bibr">667</xref>)</sup>. It also increased the HDL-C level by 8&#x02013;9% while decreasing the TG level by 20&#x02013;30%. Although gastrointestinal symptoms were found to be common adverse reactions, there were no significant differences compared to a placebo. Similar to statins, myopathylike symptoms such as an increased CK level and muscle weakness, have been reported. These effects are rare, and there are no reports indicating that the combined use with statins intensifies adverse reactions. It has recently been reported that vitamin K absorption in the intestines is mediated by NPC1L1; therefore, it is necessary to note that the action of ezetimibe combination therapy in patients who take oral warfarin may be intensified<sup><xref rid="bib668" ref-type="bibr">668</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><label>iii)</label><title>Anion-Exchange Resins (Resins): Colestimide and Cholestyramine</title><p>Resins are indicated for dyslipidemia with a high LDL-C level (type &#x02161;a). Although the first-line drugs of choice for hyper-LDL cholesterolemia are statins, resins may be the first-line drugs for patients who cannot tolerate statins because of adverse reactions, and for women who require drug therapy while pregnant or possibly pregnant. The greatest merit of resin therapy lies in combination therapy with statins.</p><p>Cholestyramine is the first medication that was proven through large-scale clinical trials to have suppressive effects on CAD incidence<sup><xref rid="bib669" ref-type="bibr">669</xref>, <xref rid="bib670" ref-type="bibr">670</xref>)</sup>. Resin adsorbs bile acids in the intestines and inhibits intestinal circulation of bile acid via reabsorption, thereby promoting catabolism from cholesterol to bile acids. It is believed that this catabolism leads to decreased sterol pools in the body and an enhanced synthesis of LDL receptors in the liver, resulting in a decreased LDL-C level in the blood<sup><xref rid="bib671" ref-type="bibr">671</xref>)</sup>. However, HMG-CoA reductase activity in the liver may simultaneously increase, enhancing cholesterol biosynthesis. Combining these drugs with statins, which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is therefore extremely logical. In contrast, bile acids act as ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR and are involved in regulating TG metabolism by controlling SREBP1c expression and enhancing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Resin administration results in a decreased LDL-C level, as well as VLDL synthesis and an increased blood TG level because of bile acid absorption. Adverse drug reactions primarily include gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation and abdominal bloating; however, no serious adverse reactions have been observed so far because these drugs are nonabsorbable. It has been pointed out that resins adsorb concomitant drugs, such as statins, digitalis, warfarin, thiazide diuretics, and thyroid gland preparations. Therefore, when these medications are concomitantly used, instructions to take them at intervals must be provided. Furthermore, as they may also inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and folic acid, vitamin supplementation should be considered during long-term resin administration.</p></sec><sec><label>iv)</label><title>Probucol</title><p>Probucol is indicated for dyslipidemia with a high LDL-C level (type &#x02161;a). This drug is characterized by its ability to cause xanthoma regression. In addition to decreasing the LDL-C level, this drug also decreases the HDL-C level.</p><p>LDL-C level reduction resulting from probucol is 15&#x02013;25%. The mechanism underlying this decrease is thought to involve enhanced LDL catabolism, particularly the promotion of cholesterol excretion into bile. On the other hand, the mechanism underlying the decrease in the HDL-C level is thought to involve the suppression of ABCA1, a membrane protein essential for HDL production. Other possible mechanisms include enhanced activity of cholesterol ester transfer proteins (CETPs) and of SR-BI, an HDL receptor. From the viewpoint of cell biology<sup><xref rid="bib672" ref-type="bibr">672</xref>, <xref rid="bib673" ref-type="bibr">673</xref>)</sup>, immunohistology<sup><xref rid="bib674" ref-type="bibr">674</xref>, <xref rid="bib675" ref-type="bibr">675</xref>)</sup> and other factors, it has become clear that LDL oxidation is an important aspect of the pathogenic mechanism of atherosclerosis. As probucol is made up of two butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) antioxidants and is fat-soluble, it is taken up by lipoproteins and exerts potent antioxidant effects. Clinically, the suppressive effects on post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) restenosis<sup><xref rid="bib676" ref-type="bibr">676</xref>, <xref rid="bib677" ref-type="bibr">677</xref>)</sup>, carotid artery IMT progression, and cardiovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib678" ref-type="bibr">678</xref>)</sup> have been reported from RCTs, albeit small-scales ones. Moreover, a cohort study has also revealed secondary-prevention effects of probucol in patients with heterozygous FH<sup><xref rid="bib679" ref-type="bibr">679</xref>)</sup>. In PQRST, however, suppressive effects on atherosclerosis progression in the femoral arteries could not be achieved with probucol administration in addition to diet therapy and cholestyramine treatment<sup><xref rid="bib680" ref-type="bibr">680</xref>)</sup>. In any case, because no large-scale clinical studies have been conducted, probucol use is limited to certain situations such as combination therapy with statins or in monotherapy in patients who cannot tolerate statins. Other than gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic disorders, and rashes, adverse drug reactions include QT prolongation and torsades de pointes on electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec><label>v)</label><title>PCSK9 Inhibitors (Human Anti-PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibodies): Evolocumab and Alirocumab</title><p>PCSK9 inhibitors are currently indicated for FH or patients with hypercholesterolemia who have a high risk for cardiovascular events and do not benefit sufficiently from even at the maximum tolerated dose statins.</p><p>These drugs bind specifically to and inhibit the actions of the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) protein, which is involved in the degradation of LDL receptors in the liver. In doing so, it increases the recycling of LDL receptors, thereby showing a blood LDL-C-lowering effect<sup><xref rid="bib681" ref-type="bibr">681</xref>)</sup>. Although increasing the synthesis of LDL receptors, statins, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver and activate SREBP2, simultaneously increase PCSK9 synthesis. Therefore, it is reasonable to use statins in combination with PCSK9 inhibitors. Their LDL-C-lowering effect is the strongest among all the existing medications. In a phase-3 study involving subjects with a high risk for cardiovascular events including those with heterozygous FH, administrating PCSK9 inhibitor once every two weeks decreased LDL-C levels by 70&#x02013;75% with combination oral statins<sup><xref rid="bib682" ref-type="bibr">682</xref>, <xref rid="bib683" ref-type="bibr">683</xref>)</sup>. These inhibitors also decrease the Lp(a) level, on which statins do not show a lowering effect. PCSK9 inhibitors decrease TG levels by 20&#x02013;25% and increases HDL-C levels by 10&#x02013;15%.</p><p>As these medications are injected subcutaneously, the main adverse drug reaction reported is a reaction at the injection site, whereas others include nasopharyngitis and gastroenteritis. No reports have stated that the combined use with statins intensifies the adverse reactions in individuals with hepatic or musculoskeletal disorders. Although adverse events caused by low LDL-C levels have not been reported, the long-term efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors should be monitored carefully.</p></sec><sec><label>vi)</label><title>MTP Inhibitor: Lomitapide</title><p>Lomitapide is currently the only microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor approved in Europe, America, and Japan. The inhibition of MTP decreases VLDL production, which in turn causes decreased LDL-C and TG levels. Even in patients with homozygous FH (HoHF) for whom other drug therapies show no effect, lomitapide decreases the LDL-C level by approximately 50%. However, major adverse drug reactions include accumulation of fat in the liver, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. As a result of these major adverse drug reactions, its long-term safety needs to be studied further in the future. The indication for lomitapide in Japan is limited to patients with hoFH.</p><p>Four weeks following commencement of a low-fat diet and administration of lomitapide in patients with hoFH, the blood LDL-C level and apo-B level decreased by 50.9% and 55.6%, respectively (average pretreatment LDL-C level: 615 mg/dL)<sup><xref rid="bib684" ref-type="bibr">684</xref>)</sup>. During lomitapide treatment, the AST and ALT levels were found to be significantly elevated, as was the liver fat content. However, these levels returned to normal in all patients 14 weeks after treatment cessation. Furthermore, a dose-dependent decrease in the LDL-C and apo-B levels was observed following lomitapide monotherapy or combination therapy with ezetimibe, in conjunction with a low-fat diet in 85 patients with high TC (average pretreatment LDL-C level: 170 mg/dL)<sup><xref rid="bib685" ref-type="bibr">685</xref>)</sup>. The maximum lomitapide dose alone decreases the LDL-C level by 30% and the apo-B level by 24% from pretreatment levels. In contrast, the combination with ezetimibe showed decreases of 46% and 37%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><label>vii)</label><title>Fibrates: Bezafibrate, Fenofibrate, Clinofibrate and Clofibrate</title><p>Fibrates are the most effective medications for hypertriglyceridemia. Fibrates are particularly effective for type &#x02162; hyperlipidemia because they enhance the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins. They are also highly effective in increasing the HDL-C level.</p><p>Their primary mechanism of action is the activation of PPAR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, a nuclear receptor, through binding of fibrates as ligands<sup><xref rid="bib686" ref-type="bibr">686</xref>, <xref rid="bib687" ref-type="bibr">687</xref>)</sup>. This results in (1) enhanced <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-oxidation of fatty acids and decreased TG production in the liver; (2) increased LPL production; (3) decreased Apo C-&#x02162; production and enhanced LPL activity, which lead to the promotion of TG degradation and catabolism from VLDL to LDL; and (4) increased production of Apo A-&#x02160; and A-&#x02161;. As a result, the TG level decreases and the HDL-C level increases. Bezafibrate has a TG-lowering effect of 30&#x02013;40%, a TC-lowering effect of approximately 10%, and an HDL-C-increasing effect of 35&#x02013;45%. Fenofibrate is characterized by its long half-life, and exerts a uric acid-lowering effect in addition to its effect on lipids.

This results in lipoprotein synthesis suppression in the liver. Furthermore, nicotinic acid derivatives exert HDL-C-increasing effects by suppressing apolipoprotein A-1 catabolism. Nicotinic acid monotherapy (3.0 g/day) causes a decrease in the TG level by 26%<sup><xref rid="bib688" ref-type="bibr">688</xref>)</sup>.

EPA and DHA suppress VLDL synthesis in the liver, thereby decreasing the TG level and exerting a slight HDL-C-increasing effect. The results of epidemiological studies and secondary-prevention studies have previously demonstrated that the consumption of fish oil and n-3 PUFA helps prevent cardiovascular events. The JELIS study<sup><xref rid="bib692" ref-type="bibr">692</xref>)</sup> conducted in Japan found that the addition of EPA to statins showed a significant preventive effect on major cardiovascular events compared to statin monotherapy. This indicates the efficacy of EPA in preventing cardiovascular events. However, recent large-scale clinical studies involving high-risk patients with both myocardial infarction and type 2 diabetes were unable to demonstrate that n-3 PUFA administration had suppressive effect on cardiovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib693" ref-type="bibr">693</xref>, <xref rid="bib694" ref-type="bibr">694</xref>)</sup>. In addition to their effects on lipids, EPA and DHA are expected to have antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects in ASCVD prevention.

In a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs<sup><xref rid="bib700" ref-type="bibr">700</xref>)</sup> and in another meta-analysis of 30 RCTs<sup><xref rid="bib701" ref-type="bibr">701</xref>)</sup>, the incidence rate of muscles-related adverse reactions with statin use was not found to be significantly different from that with a placebo. Furthermore, although the doses are much different from those in Japan, it has been suggested that a high statin dose, old age, small physical build, and female gender are risk factors for adverse reactions in Western countries<sup><xref rid="bib702" ref-type="bibr">702</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib705" ref-type="bibr">705</xref>)</sup>.

The use of these drugs in combination with statins may cause adverse events because of the intensified effects and increased drug levels in the blood. Some macrolide antibiotics, antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, and bergamottin contained in grapefruit juice, exert an inhibitory effect on CYP, and using them in combination with statins may increase statin levels in the blood.

The J-STARS study involved Japanese subjects with ischemic stroke, excluding those with cardiogenic cerebral embolism. The results of a comparison between the pravastatin group and the non-pravastatin group revealed that the former had a significantly decreased incidence rate of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (hazard ratio 0.33). Meanwhile, the incidence rate of intracranial hemorrhage was the same as the non-statin group (hazard ratio 1.00)<sup><xref rid="bib619" ref-type="bibr">619</xref>)</sup>. In terms of secondary prevention of noncardiogenic cerebral infarction, these results suggest that statin therapy has suppressive effects on atherothrombotic cerebral infarction incidence. Moreover, in regard to the results of SPARCL, which are contrary to those of a meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="bib348" ref-type="bibr">348</xref>)</sup> in which increased incidence of cerebral hemorrhage because of statin administration was not observed, it has been shown that hemorrhage incidence does not increase in the Japanese. However, regarding cerebral hemorrhage risk following cholesterol-lowering therapy, further preventive studies need to be conducted.</p><p>Among the other studies conducted in Japan, the MEGA study, which involved subjects with no history of CAD or stroke, showed that statin administration tends to decrease stroke incidence, with hazard ratios of 0.66 (men) and 0.63 (women)<sup><xref rid="bib620" ref-type="bibr">620</xref>)</sup>. In particular, ischemic stroke incidence in men and stroke in women who were &#x02265; 55 years were significantly decreased<sup><xref rid="bib620" ref-type="bibr">620</xref>, <xref rid="bib621" ref-type="bibr">621</xref>)</sup>.

For all risk categories, the management target is &#x02265; 40 mg/dL for HDL-C and &#x0003c; 150 mg/dL for TG. With respect to LDL-C and non-HDL-C, the LDL-C management target for the low-risk category is &#x0003c; 160 mg/dL (non-HDL-C &#x0003c; 190 mg/dL). The LDL-C management target is &#x0003c; 140 mg/dL (non-HDL-C &#x0003c; 170 mg/dL) for the moderate-risk category and &#x0003c; 120 mg/dL (non-HDL-C &#x0003c; 150 mg/dL) for the high-risk category.

In lipid management, patients with DM are stratified into the high-risk category, and the management targets are LDL-C &#x0003c; 120 mg/dL and non-HDL-C &#x0003c; 150 mg/dL.

Smoking cessation therapy is covered by health insurance if certain conditions are met<sup><xref rid="bib876" ref-type="bibr">876</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>For obese patients (BMI &#x02265; 25), especially those with an accumulation of visceral fat resulting from metabolic syndrome, a weight loss &#x02265; 3% in 3&#x02013;6 months should be the goal (refer to &#x0201c;4. Step 4&#x0201d; of this section). The optimization of energy and nutritional intake, and the correction of improper dietary habits and behaviors form the basis of treatment for patients with risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, DM, or obesity. High-fat meats, animal fats, and excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while adopting a salt-reduced Japanese dietary pattern combined with an intake of fish, soy, vegetables, seaweed, mushrooms, fruits, and unrefined grains.</p><p>Exercise has been shown to result in improvements in dyslipidemia (increase in HDL-C level, etc.), decrease blood pressure, improve insulin resistance, and decrease blood glucose levels. Patients should aim to perform aerobic exercise of moderate intensity for &#x02265; 30 minutes a day, three times or more per week (daily if possible). Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) is a unit that expresses the intensity of exercise in terms of the equivalent number of times the metabolism is at rest, and moderate intensity is defined as an intensity of &#x02265; 3 METs. Normal walking is equivalent to 3 METs, while brisk walking is 4 METs and jogging is 7 METs; however, these values differ according to each individual's physical fitness. Patients who do not regularly exercise should be instructed to start with light and short exercises. However, patients complicated with hypertension are subjected to exercise therapy only if they have a moderate or lower blood pressure level (&#x0003c; 180/110 mmHg) and no CVD. Exercise therapy needs to be prohibited or restricted for diabetic patients suffering from DM with extremely poor metabolic control (fasting blood glucose &#x02265; 250 mg/dL or positivity for urine ketone bodies of moderate severity or higher), new occurrence of fundal hemorrhage because of proliferative retinopathy, CAD, or renal failure. If the patient is at high risk, a medical checkup should be performed beforehand and the opinion of a specialist should be sought on whether exercise therapy is possible or if there is a need for exercise restriction.</p><disp-quote><p><bold>Step 6: Drug Therapy</bold></p><p><bold>Drug therapy (<xref rid="F8h" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8h</xref>) should be carefully initiated or continued depending on the individual risk and condition while continuously implementing lifestyle modification.

FH is dominantly inherited except for autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), a very rare form. FH patients have hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia from their birth, resulting in having a considerably high risk of CAD. Untreated heterozygous FH (HeFH) men 30 to 50 years of age and women 50 to 70 years of age are likely to develop CAD such as myocardial infarction and angina pectoris<sup><xref rid="bib878" ref-type="bibr">878</xref>)</sup>. Early diagnosis and intensive treatment as well as family screening (cascade screening) will contribute to the prevention of premature death in FH patients. HeFH patients in Japan are observed in one in 200&#x02013;500 of the general population, similar to those in other countries, suggesting that there are over 300,000 patients. Accordingly, FH is the most frequently encountered genetic disease in daily practice. Its diagnosis and treatment in childhood are important when progression of atherosclerosis begins.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Causative Genes of FH</title><p>Genetic analysis is not necessarily required for a diagnosis of FH. However, in addition to hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia, the presence of mutation in the LDL receptor or other genes involved in LDL receptor pathway gives a definitive diagnosis of FH. FH is caused by pathogenic mutations in genes of LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B-100 (Apo B-100) and PCSK9 which play an important role in LDL receptor pathway. In 60&#x02013;80% of clinically diagnosed HeFH have a mutation in these causative genes. Homozygous FH (HoFH) are defined as having 2 pathogenic mutations in 2 alleles of the causative genes. ARH is an extremely rare disease, caused by mutations in LDLRAP1 which protein is involved in LDL receptor uptake.</p></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>Diagnosis of FH</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Diagnostic Criteria</title><p>Diagnostic criteria are shown in <bold><xref rid="T14" ref-type="table">Table 14</xref></bold>. When diagnosing FH, it is necessary to pay great attention to family history in the patient interview. This is especially noted for young patients because they have a less chance to have Achilles tendon thickening. When serious illness develops concomitantly, including acute myocardial infarction, there may be a temporary drop in LDL-C. Therefore, palpation should be performed to examine the Achilles tendon and survey of the family history must be conducted for all the patients with acute myocardial infarction.</p><table-wrap id="T14" position="float"><label>Table 14.</label><caption><title>Diagnostic criteria for heterozygous FH in adults (15 years of age or older)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; Hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia (an untreated LDL-C level &#x02265; 180 mg/dL)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; Tendon xanthomas (thickening of tendons on dorsal side of the hands, elbows, knees or Achilles tendon hypertrophy) or xanthoma tuberosum</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; Family history of FH or premature CAD (within the patient's second-degree relatives)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The diagnosis should be made after excluding secondary dyslipidemia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If a patient meets two or more of the above-mentioned criteria, the condition should be diagnosed as FH.

FCHL can be distinguished from FH by the absence of tendon xanthomas, the presence of small dense LDL, the presence of other types of dyslipidemia (type IIa, type IIb, type IV) in patient's family and elevation of LDL-C to a lesser extent than for FH patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4.</label><title>Treatment of Heterozygous FH</title><sec><label>1)</label><title>Management Target Levels</title><p>Because FH is a disease associated with a very high risk of CAD, FH should be considered to correspond to secondary prevention, and it is desirable to set a management target for the LDL-C level at &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL. However, in many cases, it is difficult to achieve the target level in clinical practice. Therefore, it is also acceptable to aim for &#x0003c; 50% of the pretreatment level if the management target for LDL-C is not achieved.</p><p>In HeFH patients for secondary prevention, the LDL-C management target level is set at &#x0003c; 70 mg/dL because they can be considered to be at even higher risk.</p><p>However, there is no clear evidence for the validity of these numerical targets because clinical studies on FH without lipid-lowering therapy are ethically not permissible.

In the treatment of FH, risk assessment cannot be applied using the risk charts provided in these guidelines.</p></sec><sec><label>2)</label><title>Lifestyle Modification</title><p>Lifestyle modification should also be performed in FH patients as described in Chapter 4-2 Lifestyle Modification. However, due to the high risk of CAD, screening for CAD before administering exercise therapy is essential. CAD should be evaluated using patient interviews to determine the presence or absence of effort angina, and exercise electrocardiography and echocardiography should be performed. If the existence of CAD is suspected, administering treatment for CAD before initiating exercise therapy is thus preferred. Smoking cessation and obesity management are also important.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>Drug Therapy</title><p>In many HeFH patients, adequate lipid management is not achieved through lifestyle habit interventions alone, so drug therapy is usually combined with them. Statins are the first-line drugs for FH treatment. A retrospective analysis of 329 HeFH patients conducted in Japan revealed that statin use delayed the incidence of CAD<sup><xref rid="bib734" ref-type="bibr">734</xref>)</sup>. When sufficient efficacy is not obtained with the initial statin dose, increase the dosage to the maximum tolerated dose and co-administer with ezetimibe. If efficacy is still not adequate, PCSK9 inhibitors, resins and probucol are used (<bold><xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref></bold>). When the attending physician determines that the risk is particularly high, such as in secondary prevention patients and those with underlying diabetes, LDL-C should be lowered as early as possible.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Treatment flow chart for adult (15 years or over) heterozygous FH</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jat-25-846-g009"/></fig><p>A retrospective study suggested that probucol delayed recurrence of CAD in HeFH. In addition, it has been reported that the addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab (Rutherford-&#x02161; study<sup><xref rid="bib879" ref-type="bibr">879</xref>)</sup>) or alirocumab (Odyssey FHI and FHII studies<sup><xref rid="bib880" ref-type="bibr">880</xref>)</sup>) in HeFH patients already being treated with statin (and ezetimibe) the further lowering of LDL-C (approx 60%) and Lp(a) was achieved relatively safely.

It is necessary to assess CAD, valvular disease (aortic valve stenosis and supravalvular aortic stenosis in particular) and aortic aneurysm, and make a careful judgment based on the findings before giving any guidance on exercise therapy because progression of atherosclerosis is remarkable in HoFH patients.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>Drug Therapy</title><p>In HoFH, in order to prevent the incidence and progression of CAD, intensive lipid-lowering therapy should be initiated as early as possible at an early age (<bold><xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref></bold>). The major mechanisms of action of statins, bile acid adsorbing resins and PCSK9 inhibitors are to enhance expression (activation) of LDL receptors. For the defective type, in which only a small amount of LDL receptor activity remains, slight efficacy is observed but in the negative type in which LDL receptor activity is completely absent, no LDL-C lowering effect is observed<sup><xref rid="bib881" ref-type="bibr">881</xref>, <xref rid="bib882" ref-type="bibr">882</xref>)</sup>. A retrospective study found that the administration of statin and other drugs was effective in reducing mortality rates in HoFH<sup><xref rid="bib883" ref-type="bibr">883</xref>)</sup>. It has been reported that MTP inhibitors, which were developed for HoFH patients, lowered LDL-C by approximately 50%<sup><xref rid="bib693" ref-type="bibr">693</xref>, <xref rid="bib884" ref-type="bibr">884</xref>)</sup>. However, as the frequencies of the adverse events of fatty liver and diarrhea are high, it is essential to control the fat and alcohol intake strictly. Probucol reportedly exerts a certain LDL-C lowering effect on HoFH and may cause the regression or disappearance of xanthoma in the skin or Achilles tendon<sup><xref rid="bib885" ref-type="bibr">885</xref>)</sup>. Nevertheless, for LDL-C control, LDL apheresis therapy once every 1&#x02013;2 weeks is still required in many cases. When patients are resistant to all of the above treatments or show intolerance, liver transplantation may be considered.</p><fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Fig. 10.</label><caption><p>Treatment flow chart for adult (15 years or over) homozygous FH</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jat-25-846-g010"/></fig></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>LDL Apheresis in HoFH</title><p>In patients with HoFH, it is difficult to decrease the LDL-C level sufficiently using existing drug therapies, and many patients require continued LDL apheresis with extracorporeal circulation starting in childhood. Considering the inhibition of the progression of CAD, the earlier LDL apheresis is initiated, the better; however, it is difficult to perform LDL apheresis until the affected child can be kept in bed during apheresis. Realistically, the timing of treatment initiation is 4 to 6 years of age, when children can lie on bed and extracorporeal circulation can be performed; however, it is recommended that the treatment be initiated as early as possible.</p></sec><sec><label>5)</label><title>Pregnancy and Delivery of Patients with HoFH</title><p>It is important to permit patients with HoFH to become pregnant as planned. Before pregnancy, screening for atherosclerosis should be performed using carotid ultrasonography, echocardiography and exercise tolerance tests to assess the status of atherosclerosis. By three months before the planned pregnancy, treatment with lipid-lowering drugs other than bile acid-binding resins should be discontinued. Because the cardiovascular system is greatly stressed during late pregnancy, particularly at delivery, performing LDL apheresis during pregnancy is desirable. LDL apheresis can also be safely administered during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><label>6)</label><title>HoFH Designated as an Intractable Disease</title><p>HoFH has been designated as an intractable disease in the Specified Disease Treatment Research Program since 2009. The criteria for designation are as follows: patients with HoFH definitively diagnosed using a genetic analysis of genes involved in the LDL metabolic pathway or measurement of the LDL receptor activity are definitively designated, and patients with remarkable hypercholesterolemia and those with cutaneous xanthoma starting in childhood who are refractory to drug treatment should be designated.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>6.</label><title>Treatment of Pediatric HeFH</title><p>When HeFH is diagnosed, patients should be provided with guidance regarding lifestyle modification such as diet and exercise as quickly as possible in order to reduce the risk for atherosclerosis by means of LDL-C lowering. <bold><xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref></bold> shows a treatment flow chart for pediatric HeFH<sup><xref rid="bib886" ref-type="bibr">886</xref>)</sup>. For both boy and girl patients from the age of &#x02265; 10 years, pharmacotherapy needs to be considered if the LDL-C level is persistently above 180 mg/dL. Statins are the first line drugs starting from the minimal dose. In Japan, pitavastatin has been indicated for pediatric FH patients of &#x02265; 10 years since June 2015. The target LDL-C level should ideally be &#x0003c; 140 mg/dL. When there is a family history of premature CAD or diabetes is also present, ensure that the LDL-C level is kept below 140 mg/dL. While it will be difficult to achieve targets in serious cases, efforts should be made to achieve a level as close to the target as possible through combination drug therapy.

The prognosis after the incidence of cerebrovascular disease and CAD is also poor, which increases the risk for disability. Therefore, primary and secondary preventions are extremely important. However, because aging is a stronger risk factor than other risk factors associated with ASCVD, the weighting of other risk factors such as dyslipidemia become relatively less. Nevertheless, these risk factors should also be managed accordingly.</p><p>Epidemiological studies in Western countries have revealed that hyper-LDL cholesterolemia is also a risk factor for CAD among the elderly (primarily in the young elderly: 65&#x02013;74 years of age) as well as in nonelderly adults<sup><xref rid="bib902" ref-type="bibr">902</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib907" ref-type="bibr">907</xref>)</sup>. Although, many of the studies in the elderly aged &#x02265; 75 years reported that there was no relationship between the LDL-C level and the risk of CAD<sup><xref rid="bib908" ref-type="bibr">908</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib910" ref-type="bibr">910</xref>)</sup>, a meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies in Japan (65,594 subjects, aged 70&#x02013;89 years, EPOCH-JAPAN) reported that in men, total cholesterol &#x02265; 240mg/dL correlated with significantly increased death from CAD. No significant relationship was found in women. There was no significant relationship for stroke mortality in either sex<sup><xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)</sup>. Furthermore, according to the NIPPON DATA 90 cohort data relating to the relationship between non-HDL-C and ASCVD, a significant relationship was found between non-HDL-C and CAD in elderly subjects aged &#x02265; 65 years, but no significant relationship was found between non-HDL-C and cerebral infarction or stroke<sup><xref rid="bib911" ref-type="bibr">911</xref>)</sup>. A meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies including approximately 900 thousand adult men and women in Europe and North America, confirmed the deaths of 55,000 subjects from cardiovascular events during the reported observation periods, such as CAD and cerebrovascular disease. Of these, a significant correlation was found between total serum cholesterol at the beginning of the observation period and death from CAD in the elderly (aged 70&#x02013;89 years), although a relationship with stroke was not identified<sup><xref rid="bib912" ref-type="bibr">912</xref>)</sup>. In a further meta-analysis of 29 cohort studies in the Asia-Pacific region, a significant positive correlation was found between total cholesterol and death from CAD in not only individuals &#x0003c; 60 years but also in the 60&#x02013;74 year group and &#x02265; 75 year group; however, no relationship was identified between stroke and lipid levels<sup><xref rid="bib913" ref-type="bibr">913</xref>)</sup>. As such, some independent cohort studies did not find a positive correlation between serum lipid levels and ASCVD in the elderly aged &#x02265; 65 years, but meta-analyses have reported positive correlations between CAD and total cholesterol, non-HDL-C and LDL-C. However, even meta-analyses have revealed no correlation between stroke and these lipid levels.</p><p>In the Japan Cholesterol and Diabetes Mellitus Study, an observational study including elderly Japanese people with diabetes, a significant relationship was found between CAD and HDL-C as well as the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and between cerebrovascular disease and HDL-C in the elderly aged &#x02265; 75 years; however, no relationship was found between LDL-C and non-HDL-C and either of these diseases<sup><xref rid="bib914" ref-type="bibr">914</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>There is almost no clinical evidence related to the elderly aged &#x02265; 85 years, a cohort which is expected to become larger in the future.

However, the Cardiovascular Health Study has shown that in the elderly aged &#x02265; 85 years, LDL-C was not a risk factor for cardiovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib915" ref-type="bibr">915</xref>)</sup>.

In this study, 3.2 years of statin administration on patients aged 70&#x02013;82 years, including secondary prevention patients, lowered the primary endpoint (CAD death + nonfatal myocardial infarction + fatal and nonfatal stroke) by 15%, clearly demonstrating that intervention with statins could also be applied to the elderly. The reduction of CAD risk was more pronounced in men than in women as well as in secondary prevention patients than primary prevention, although no significant difference was observed in the interaction analysis.</p><p>Several meta-analyses by Cholesterol Treatment Trialists have been published, and showed the following: in the &#x0003e; 65 years group, the relative risk of statin therapy on major coronary artery events was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76&#x02013;0.88] (2005)<sup><xref rid="bib917" ref-type="bibr">917</xref>)</sup>, the relative risk on a major vascular event of statin and high-dose statin groups in subjects aged 66&#x02013;75 years was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74&#x02013;0.83) relative to the control group or a low-dose statin group, and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73&#x02013;0.97) in the group &#x0003e; 75 years (2010). Both meta-analyses demonstrated that statin therapy showed increased effects than the control group, and that high-dose statins had greater effects than a low-dose statin group in preventing an event<sup><xref rid="bib918" ref-type="bibr">918</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 51,351 elderly subjects aged &#x02265; 60 years, including primary and secondary prevention patients, who received intervention with statins showed that statin therapy decreased total mortality by 15% (95% CI: 7&#x02013;22%), death from CAD by 23% (95% CI: 15&#x02013;29%), fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 26% (95% CI: 22&#x02013;30%), and fatal and nonfatal stroke by 24% (95% CI: 10&#x02013;35%) compared to the placebo. However, the relative risk of cancer onset with statin therapy was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.95&#x02013;1.18) relative to the placebo, and the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between statins and the placebo in terms of adverse events, such as a &#x02265; 3-fold increase of AST and ALT, &#x02265; 10-fold increase of CK or termination of the trial. However, muscle pain and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred significantly more often in the statin group. Moreover, new-onset diabetes was significantly higher in the statin group among those &#x02265; 65 years<sup><xref rid="bib919" ref-type="bibr">919</xref>)</sup>. A meta-analysis of CAD mortality risk in a secondary prevention intervention trial, including elderly subjects aged &#x02265; 65 years, showed that the effects of secondary prevention on the elderly are far greater than that would be predicted from the outcomes in younger individuals<sup><xref rid="bib920" ref-type="bibr">920</xref>)</sup>. As such, the secondary prevention effects of statin in the elderly with CAD history are evident and are recommended. The recently published J-STARS is a research study investigating the efficacy of 10 mg pravastatin on patients with ischemic stroke aged 45&#x02013;80 years. Although no significant difference was found in terms of the primary endpoint, statins decreased the incidence of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction by 67%<sup><xref rid="bib921" ref-type="bibr">921</xref>)</sup>. Considering the mean patient age of 66 years in this study, approximately half of the subjects were presumed to be elderly, and considering that the effects of statin therapy were observed regardless of age group, these results suggest that statins are capable of preventing the recurrence of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction in the elderly.</p><p>Meanwhile, the MEGA Study on primary prevention in the elderly showed that the concurrent risk of CAD and cerebral infarction decreased significantly in individuals aged &#x02265; 65 years [hazard ratio: 0.60 (0.39&#x02013;0.93)], which was related to the efficacy of statin treatment in the elderly with high LDL-C<sup><xref rid="bib922" ref-type="bibr">922</xref>)</sup>. Another meta-analysis, involving only primary prevention studies, also indicated that statin administration lowered the risk of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events and major cerebrovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib923" ref-type="bibr">923</xref>)</sup>. Another meta-analysis of primary prevention including 24,674 elderly patients (mean age: 73 years, 43% women) confirmed that statins decreased myocardial infarction and stroke by approximately 40% and 25%, respectively<sup><xref rid="bib924" ref-type="bibr">924</xref>)</sup>. The efficacy of statin treatment has thus been established, at least for primary prevention in younger elderly patients. Consequently, pharmaceutical therapy can be recommended on the basis of the risk factors present. However, there is still a lack of strong evidence for primary prevention in the elderly aged &#x02265; 75 years. As there is no method of risk assessment for elderly patients aged &#x02265; 75 years, as indicated in Chapter 2, treatment should be given, or dismissed, at the discretion of the attending physician. In addition, as geriatric syndrome complications, such as frailty and sarcopenia, are common in elderly aged &#x02265; 75 years, it is important to confirm whether patients in this particular group have adequate protein intake when dietary counseling is provided.</p></sec><sec><label>2)</label><title>The Effects of Statins in Dementia Prevention</title><p>A selection of observational and interventional studies has attempted to investigate the effects of statin treatment on dementia prevention. However, many of these reports relate to subanalysis and secondary endpoints, and studies that set cognitive function as the primary endpoint involved sample sizes that were too small. An observational study suggested that statin treatment improves cognitive function<sup><xref rid="bib925" ref-type="bibr">925</xref>)</sup>, many research results do not support these effects<sup><xref rid="bib926" ref-type="bibr">926</xref>, <xref rid="bib927" ref-type="bibr">927</xref>)</sup>. A meta-analysis of interventional trials of four statins on patients with Alzheimer's disease patients in a recent Cochrane review, however, failed to demonstrate that statins could improve cognitive function<sup><xref rid="bib928" ref-type="bibr">928</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, we can conclude that the effects of statins in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease are not positive. Although there is no research data relating to the assessment of statin effects on vascular dementia, we do know that stroke increases dementia risk by approximately 2-fold and that statins decrease the incidence of stroke; consequently, the preventive effects of statins on vascular dementia incidence can be expected. However, there are some case reports in which statins decreased cognitive function, and must, therefore, be approached with caution.</p></sec><sec><label>3)</label><title>Frailty, a New Risk Factor that should be Considered in the Elderly</title><p>In the elderly, frailty is another factor which can require long-term care, much like dementia. In fact, there have been recent studies reporting that the incidence of cardiovascular events increases in elderly patients with frailty, or those who show vulnerability to acute stressors, a condition that appears with age. For example, White et al. conducted a prospective follow-up study dividing non-ST-elevating ACS patients aged &#x02265; 65 years into three groups: frail, pre-frail, and nonfrail groups using Fried criteria and found that the frail group had significantly higher primary endpoints of cardiovascular, myocardial infarction and stroke mortality than the nonfrail group (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.36&#x02013;2.28), and that all-cause mortality also increased significantly (HR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.47&#x02013;2.68)<sup><xref rid="bib929" ref-type="bibr">929</xref>)</sup>. In another study, Sergi et al. divided 1,567 nonfrail elderly patients aged 65&#x02013;96 years into three groups: a group meeting 1 Fried criterion, a group meeting 2 Fried criteria and a third group that did not meet any of the criteria; these groups were followed-up for 4.4 years in relation to CAD, heart failure, stroke, PAD and cardiovascular death as the primary endpoints. Even after adjustment for the confounding factors, event incidence occurred significantly more frequently in the groups meeting 1 or 2 Fried criteria; in other words, those in the pre-frail groups, compared to the robust group<sup><xref rid="bib930" ref-type="bibr">930</xref>)</sup>. This suggested that frailty, characterized by low grip strength and slower walking speed, may represent a new risk factor for cardiovascular events in the elderly, and that there may be a need to make more comprehensive assessments that include geriatric syndromes such as frailty.</p><p>Sarcopenia is a pathological condition related to frailty. Sarcopenia is characterized by decreased muscle mass associated with age, which decreases muscular strength and walking speed, and has been suggested to not only cause falls and fractures but also exert impact on cardiovascular events<sup><xref rid="bib931" ref-type="bibr">931</xref>)</sup>. Because statins cause muscle disorder as a side effect, it is concerned that long-term continuous use may be related to sarcopenia incidence. For example, Scott et al. showed that the use of statins in the community-dwelling elderly was linked to decreased leg muscle strength<sup><xref rid="bib932" ref-type="bibr">932</xref>)</sup>; however, a subsequent meta-analysis by Krishnan et al. concluded that the earlier study by Scott et al. was lacking in convincing evidence<sup><xref rid="bib933" ref-type="bibr">933</xref>)</sup>. Lynch et al. further reported that the use of statins in 3,422 elderly patients in rehabilitation (mean age = 81.4 years) was associated with an improvement in the activities of daily living<sup><xref rid="bib934" ref-type="bibr">934</xref>)</sup>. As such, at present, there is simply not enough evidence to support the fact that statin treatment increases the risk of sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec><label>4)</label><title>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Statin Treatment during End-of-Life Care</title><p>Sometimes doctors cannot decide whether or not a patient's medication should be continued or terminated, even during end-of-life care. Most clinical research tests the effects of pharmaceutical drugs by initiating them; however, Kutner <italic>et al.</italic> randomly assigned 381 patients estimated to have &#x02264; 1 year of life expectancy into two groups: one group for which treatment would be terminated and a second group that would continue taking the prescribed statin. These authors set death as the primary endpoint, and also studied quality of life (QOL) and financial effects. Results showed that there was no increase in deaths or cardiovascular events when statin treatment was terminated, and instead showed that QOL improved and that patients were able to save on their medical costs<sup><xref rid="bib935" ref-type="bibr">935</xref>)</sup>. At the end of life, it is sometimes difficult to continue taking medication due to decreased appetite or dysphagia; hence, it is logical that being able to decrease oral medication in a safe manner will lead to an improvement in patient QOL.</p><p>Because statins in primary prevention are thought to take 3&#x02013;4 years to have an effect upon the suppression of vascular events, the use of statins should only be considered in cases with at least &#x02265; 3 years of life expectancy.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>Care of the Elderly</title><p>For preventing ASCVD in the elderly and maintaining QOL, it is important to manage dyslipidemia, particularly hyper-LDL cholesterolemia, which is an important risk factor. At the same time, it is important to consider the increase in secondary dyslipidemia, which occurs with complications such as hypothyroidism. There are many aspects to carefully consider in providing treatment to the elderly, such as the comorbidities other than ASCVD that may impact upon vital prognosis, latent organ disorder, atypical symptoms, decreased organ spare ability, decreased drug metabolism ability, malnutrition, frailty, polypharmacy, and due to variability in physical functions, careful considerations should be paid to treatment.</p><p>The basic treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary and exercise therapy for the elderly. Drug therapy should not be given at ease without implementing nonpharmaceutical therapies first. However, because adherence to strict diet therapies can worsen the nutritional state of the elderly, particularly in the latterstage elderly population, and because it is difficult for many to take on the same-level of physical activity as nonelderly adults for exercise therapy, it is best to make an intervention which is adapted to each individual's capacity.

Other possible causes include a deficiency of apolipoprotein C-II, which activates LPL, and mutations in apolipoprotein A-V genes.</p><p>Homozygotes have very severe hypertriglyceridemia (&#x02265; 1,000 mg/dL). Diet therapy (fat intake restriction and the use of medium-chain fatty-acid milk for infants) is the primary form of treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4.</label><title>Secondary Dyslipidemia</title><p>Various causes are involved in the development of secondary dyslipidemia. Among these, obesity is frequently involved. In addition, thyroid hormones should always be tested when the cause is unclear because some patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis) have severe hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia. Attention should also be paid to druginduced dyslipidemia.</p><p>Obese patients require treatment to reduce the degree of obesity. Hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia accompanying diabetes is also particularly problematic in children. Diabetes itself is a major risk factor for arteriosclerosis, and blood glucose control alone seems to be insufficient for preventing ASCVD (see Chapter 4 &#x0201c;Comprehensive Risk Management, 4-2) Diabetes&#x0201d;). The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes guidelines<sup><xref rid="bib991" ref-type="bibr">991</xref>)</sup> state lipid management targets of &#x0003c; 100 mg/dL for LDL-C, &#x0003e; 35 mg/dL for HDL-C, and &#x0003c; 150 mg/dL for TG. When LDL-C is above the target level, blood glucose control is intensified and diet and exercise therapies for hyperlipidemia are added. For hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the basic approach is to improve lifestyle habits<sup><xref rid="bib991" ref-type="bibr">991</xref>)</sup>. In Japan, the general consensus is that LDL-C should be maintained at least within the normal range (&#x0003c; 140 mg/dL); however, no explicit criteria are currently available for drug therapy for children<sup><xref rid="bib992" ref-type="bibr">992</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, it is important to take care of children's diets and continue with strict blood glucose control.</p></sec><sec><label>5.</label><title>Maintaining Proper Body Weight with Appropriate Diet and Exercise Habits</title><p>Pathological blood vessel changes associated with arteriosclerosis have been reported to gradually occur in childhood<sup><xref rid="bib993" ref-type="bibr">993</xref>, <xref rid="bib994" ref-type="bibr">994</xref>)</sup>. It is important to prevent such changes from occurring and progressing as much as possible. To achieve this, it is important to develop correct lifestyle habits (e.g., diet) and maintain a proper body weight from childhood. Even in children, obesity causes problems such as abnormal blood test values (e.g., adipocytokine secretion) and blood pressure<sup><xref rid="bib995" ref-type="bibr">995</xref>, <xref rid="bib996" ref-type="bibr">996</xref>)</sup>. Thus, obesity in children is also considered to promote ASCVD similar to that in adults, and attention paid to obesity during childhood helps reduce the risk of future lifestyle-related diseases.</p><p>The 2015 Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese<sup><xref rid="bib997" ref-type="bibr">997</xref>)</sup> lists the desirable daily energy intake according to age and body size. Regarding nutritional balance, the target ratios of energy intake from fat and carbohydrates are 20&#x02013;30% and 50&#x02013;65%, respectively, which are same for all age groups (from 1 year to &#x02265; 70 years). Fat intake should be moderate because in recent years, due to the westernization of dietary habits, fat intake has increased. Therefore, it is recommended that individuals consume a well-balanced amount of fish, soybeans (products), vegetables, fruits, and seaweed, by utilizing Japanese food patterns as a main method, with no preference to a particular type of food. Care should also be taken to avoid excess salt intake.</p><p>Because BMI percentile (or standard deviation) method is inappropriate to evaluate overweight and obesity in children, because of the large variability in body height, it is better to assess the percentage of overweight (POW) based on comparison with standard body weight<sup><xref rid="bib998" ref-type="bibr">998</xref>)</sup>. The POW is calculated as [(measured body weight&#x02013;standard body weight)/standard body weight] &#x000d7; 100 (%). In general, elementary and junior high school students are classified as obese if the calculated POW is + 20% or higher (&#x02265; 120% of the standard body weight)<sup><xref rid="bib998" ref-type="bibr">998</xref>)</sup>. Like in obese adults, LDL-C and TG tend to be high in obese children, whereas HDL-C tends to be low. Even if the calculated POW is not indicative of severe obesity (&#x02265; 50%), the child is considered to be &#x0201c;obesity disease&#x0201d;, a target of treatment for reducing the severity of obesity, when he or she exhibits any obesity-related complications<sup><xref rid="bib996" ref-type="bibr">996</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>In obesity, the energy intake is increased and exceeds the necessary level; it should be reversed to normal levels. Obese children should increase their vegetable intake and avoid certain drinks and seasonings. The degree of obesity improves more easily during childhood because body height continues to increase. Moreover, an exercise habit should be established at the same time as dietary restrictions. In particular, adequate guidance should be given to children who are obese or not accustomed to exercise. In cases of severe obesity, energy intake may also need to be restricted.</p><p>Smoking is also an independent major risk factor for ASCVD, and smoking cessation is known to reduce the risk of developing such diseases. Because passive smoking has also been reported to increase the risk for CAD and diabetes, attention should be paid to smoking not only by the patient themselves but also by other family members.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>Many studies performed in the Western countries consider a diet containing fat to &#x02264; 25% or to &#x02264; 30% of total energy intake as being a low-fat diet. Hence, the low-fat diet mentioned here refers to a dietary pattern in which the percentage of energy of fat is 30% or less of the total energy intake. It is necessary to take note that this is different from diets containing fat to 20&#x02013;25% of total energy intake that are recommended in Japan and the fatrestricted diets for hyperchylomicronemia.</p></fn></fn-group><sec><title>Footnotes</title><p>This is an English version of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases 2017 published in Japanese in June 30, 2017.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1)</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
