Metal and organic pollutants are discharged into the marine environment through the sewage system and from the surrounding catchments. They are released as diffusive inputs or during flood events. The city of Marseille has one of the largest Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) in Europe, serving 1.7 million inhabitants and using both physical and biological treatment processes. A large proportion of the treated wastewaters are discharged into the rivers (50%), with a noticeable signature of trace metals from the WWTP effluent during baseflow [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In dry periods, continental outflows from urban and industrial areas merge in Marseille and mix with the WWTP effluent down to an outlet located at the sea surface at Cortiou on the southern coastline. During flood events, significant amounts of trace metals are discharged into the surface aquatic system through runoff processes [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and in extreme cases as the outflows exceed the WWTP outlet capacity, a significant part of the continental waters are directly channeled into the southern bay of Marseille. On average, during flood events, 90% of the continental waters and particulate matter are channeled through the outlet and only 10% are diverted to the southern bay. In addition, the discharge of untreated wastewater in the coastal zone was estimated between 456 and 1450 t<sup><bold>.</bold></sup>y<sup>-1</sup> of Suspended Particulate Matter during the period 2001&#x02013;2007 [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As the WWTP effluent is a major source of water and particles discharged from the city to the coastal area, previous modelling work focused on Marseille as a source of nutrients or contaminants for the coastal area. The focus was on modelling the impact of meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions on the fate of the WWTP contaminants in the coastal waters [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Successive modelling studies of the hydrodynamics in the bays of Marseille have been carried out. Firstly, we used the 3D-Princeton Ocean Model on a 250 x 350 horizontal grid with a horizontal resolution of 100 m and 11 vertical sigma levels, in order to map the wind<bold>-</bold>induced hydrodynamic connections between the artificial reefs submerged in the central southern bay and the surrounding shorelines [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Secondly, 2 versions of the 3D-model MARS3D&#x02013;RHOMA (for Rh&#x000f4;ne-Marseille Area), with respective resolutions of 200 m and 400 m and 30 vertical sigma levels, were implemented on a domain extending from the Rh&#x000f4;ne River (roughly 40 km west of Marseille) to Cap Sici&#x000e9; (roughly 40 km southeast of Marseille), within the framework of the METROC, FP7 PERSEUS and EC2CO/PNEC MASSILIA projects, with the aim of coupling hydrodynamic, sediment transport and biogeochemical models. The results, described in [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref rid="pone.0195257.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], confirmed that the water circulation in the bays of Marseille is mainly controlled by the wind regimes, but also by the Rh&#x000f4;ne River seasonal floods, and the periodic intrusions of the Northern Current (NC) on the continental shelf south of Marseille. These intrusions of the NC on the continental shelf have been studied and explained by many authors on the basis of surveys involving in situ Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements and 3D numerical modelling [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref rid="pone.0195257.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The latter results led the authors [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to propose 3 types of wind conditions likely to favor an intrusion of the NC on the shelf: i) &#x02018;intrusions under easterlies&#x02019; that correspond to a stable SE wind regime; ii) &#x02018;intrusions under northwesterlies&#x02019; that correspond to a relaxation of a NW wind, in stratified conditions; iii) &#x02018;a combination of the 2 wind patterns&#x02019; involving a strong NW wind event immediately followed by a SE wind regime that reinforces the intrusion of the NC on the shelf.</p><p>In addition, a recent combination of the results of the 3D RHOMA model (resolution of 200 m) and the Lagrangian model ICHTHYOP was used to compute the wind<bold>-</bold>induced connectivity at the surface between different populations of the seaweed <italic>Cystoseira amentacea</italic> within the bays of Marseille under strong and well-established NW and SE wind regimes [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The results highlighted very rapid northwestward connections of propagules, considered as passive particles, at the surface in less than 18 hours across the bays from the WWTP outlet at Cortiou to the limit of the northern coastline. However, this modeling experiment showed that particle trajectories induced by well-established SE winds gave rise to strong connections between the eastern and western limits of the domain, passing south of the Frioul archipelago, but without entering the inner bays of Marseille and not resulting in connections on the shorelines of the northern and southern bays [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>As a result, more recent simulations of connectivity were performed by combining the results of the RHOMA model (200 m resolution) with the ICHTHYOP tool, still under efficient SE wind regimes, but this time taking into account the deeper sub<bold>-</bold>surface circulation between 10 and 30 m depth, likely to enter the inner bays. These new sets of computations of the sub<bold>-</bold>surface circulation entering the inner bays of Marseille provided a basis for only taking into account the episodes of intrusions of the NC on the continental shelf that occurred under SE wind regimes, which have emerged as the dominant process giving rise to connections between southeastern offshore areas and the northern and southern bays. This result is of major importance in that it concerns the inner bays of Marseille, characterized by the highest number of sites that are vulnerable with regard to human activities such as tourism and the commercial activities of ports or beaches, fish farming, artificial reefs for production or sampling stations for water quality monitoring.</p><p>The aim of this study was to provide new insight into the previously under-estimated impact of the Cortiou WWTP effluent on the water quality of the bays of Marseille. Our approach was not chosen according to the usual approach defined in terms of the dilution of dissolved constituents, but according to a Lagrangian approach that consisted in computing the trajectories of a patch of passive and conservative particles discharged at the WWTP outlet, under the specific conditions of circulation which characterize the intrusion of the NC on the continental shelf near Marseille. The impact of the WWTP effluent on the water quality of the bays is identified, both from the spatial and quantitative points of view, by quantifying the amounts of fine, non-motile, neutrally-buoyant particles that reach 10 different specific sites, chosen along the shorelines of both northern and southern bays, according to their vulnerability with regard to local human activities.</p></sec><sec

Ichthyop is an Individual-Based Model (IBM) with various sub-models including biological behaviors. Here, we used only the movement sub-model that simulates the following processes: horizontal and vertical advection, horizontal and vertical dispersion. In our study, horizontal and vertical advection were used in the movement equation but no horizontal or vertical dispersion was applied. Particles were considered as passive tracers. For time-stepping, a fourth order Runge&#x02013;Kutta integration scheme was used with a constant time step of 30 s that respected the CFL criterion on the entire domain. In our study, the ICHTHYOP model was run taking into account the 3-hour resolution fields of Eulerian current velocities, temperature and salinity, previously computed by the MARS3D. In ICHTHYOP, these fields are interpolated in space to provide values at any individual (particle) location. They are also interpolated in time to feed the IBM time step (30 s) that addresses sub-grid scale processes. Simulations consist of tracking the locations and properties of the individuals (particles), typically during periods from a few hours to a few weeks. The output time step was 3 hours. Each computation took into account the same design for the initial source located at the WWTP outlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g001">Fig 1</xref>): a circular patch of 5x10<sup>4</sup> particles with a diameter equal to a half mesh size (eg. 100 m or 200 m for the version of the model used), located at 1 m depth with a vertical thickness of 1 m. In addition, in each ICHTHYOP computation we considered the particles as passive elements in suspension without any biogeochemical transformation, with no buoyancy and no sinking velocity. All the Lagrangian trajectories were computed by ICHTHYOP as direct trajectories, with particles being transported from a single source, still located at the surface (1 m depth) at the WWTP, towards their respective targets within the bays. In addition, as the time of release strongly impacts the trajectories and final destination of particles, various tests were made on the time of the release for each event considered, and a choice was made to select the timing associated with trajectories that best transport the particles further up the bays. The source files of all the particle trajectories computed by ICHTHYOP in our study are available within the Supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195257.s001">S1 Dataset</xref>, with the two netcdf files S1A and S1B corresponding to the computations of the entire chosen periods of June 2008 and October 2011, respectively.</p><p>Finally, the number of suspended particles reaching each regional box shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g001">Fig 1</xref>, during each Lagrangian transport computation, is then counted and compared to the number of particles constituting the initial patch.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Particulate organic matter</title><p>The ratios of the stable isotopes of carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) and nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N) allow the identification of Particulate Organic Matter (POM) sources in coastal waters.

In addition, it is interesting to note that our results identify 2 specific locations of downwelling, where particles from the WWTP outlet sink to sub<bold>-</bold>surface depths, according to the angle of incidence of the SE winds, and resulting surface currents, with respect to the orientation of the southern coastline at the site of the WWTP outlet. In summary, an E-SE wind with higher incidence (direction &#x0003c; 120&#x000b0;) will induce delayed particle sinking and shallower and faster connectivity, especially effective in reaching the distant shorelines of the northern bay, while a S-SE wind with lower incidence (direction &#x0003e; 120&#x000b0;) will induce immediate particle sinking and deeper and slower connectivity, especially effective in reaching the inner shorelines of the southern bay.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Confirmation of the particle origins</title><p>On the basis of the measurements of stable isotopes, our results confirmed that the POM at Somlit is partially constituted of particles transported from the WWTP effluent. As suggested by the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C stable isotope ratio, the sea surface POM, which arrived at Somlit on October 17, 2011, was probably constituted by a mixture of marine phytoplankton transported by the NC and detritus particles from the WWTP effluent. Moreover, the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N stable isotope ratio of POM at Somlit was particularly influenced by the POM from the WWTP plume. These particles are consumed by the zooplankton and integrate the pelagic food web particularly during the cold season (fall and winter) [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These particles may also be consumed by benthic filter feeder organisms after their release at the WWTP outlet [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A mixture of marine phytoplankton and a large part of the POM from the WWTP effluent may be consumed by the filter feeder organisms in the artificial reefs (R&#x000e9;cifs), even if the main source of this food web suggested by the authors is the nanophytoplankton [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In fact, according to these authors, the estimated value of the basis of the food web (&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C = -25.23&#x000b1;1.16 &#x02030;, &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N = 1.77&#x000b1;0.25 &#x02030;) is rather close to values of the POM from the WWTP effluent at Cortiou (&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C = -25.5&#x000b1;0.62 &#x02030;, &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N = 0.59&#x000b1;0.85 &#x02030;). The results of the present paper, relating to intrusions of the NC on the shelf and the high resulting impact of the particles from the WWTP effluent in the artificial reefs zone (R&#x000e9;cifs), support this hypothesis.</p><p>Interestingly, hydrodynamic circulation and stable isotope ratios could be used at the same time to better identify the respective contributions of the different seawater sources of POM. For example, in October 2001, at Somlit: 40% and 60% of the sampled POM may be attributed to particles from the WWTP effluent and marine phytoplankton, respectively. Thus, Lagrangian trajectories computed in this study confirm that a significant part of the particles from the WWTP effluent are effectively connected to Somlit (3&#x02013;7%), and furthermore the study published by [<xref rid="pone.0195257.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that the NC intrusion of October 17, 2011, induced an intrusion on the shelf of the warmer and mostly oligotrophic water from the NC, characterized at Somlit by its signature in terms of offshore marine phytoplankton.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Concerns about human activities</title><p>From a health point of view, Niolon is a diving and bathing site that is potentially at risk of being contaminated by the particles from the WWTP outlet. Finally, it is crucial that Rouet, which is the site of a Protected Marine Area, is almost never impacted by the potentially polluted particles. Joliette is a commercial harbour that is more likely to be polluted by vessel traffic than by particles from the WWTP effluent.</p><p>In the southern bay, it should be noted that the sites the most impacted by the WWTP effluent are SE Frioul (especially in October, 2011) and R&#x000e9;cifs, each characterized by vulnerable human activities such as fish farming (SE Frioul) and a zone of artificial reefs for production (R&#x000e9;cifs). In addition, we highlighted that the sites R&#x000e9;cifs (artificial reefs), and also Somlit (water quality monitoring station), both located in the middle of the southern bay, were highly impacted by particles from the WWTP effluent, especially in June 2008. This result reveals that the particles from the WWTP can potentially be integrated into the pelagic and the benthic food webs within the southern bay, where professional and recreational fishing is highly developed. Finally, bathing areas such as Proph&#x000e8;te, Prado and Madrague, located at the southeastern limit of the anticyclonic sub-surface circulation induced by the intrusion of the NC within the southern bay, remain weakly impacted by particles from the WWTP effluent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mechanism we propose in the present study for the dispersal of fine particles from the WWTP effluent at Cortiou throughout the bays of Marseille involves surface, shallow (&#x0003c; 10 m depth) and sub-surface (about 20 m depth) modes of particle transport, induced by intrusions of the NC on the continental shelf, associated with SE wind regimes. These modelling results are quite new and unexpected. In fact, the present study is of interest because the importance of the sub<bold>-</bold>surface circulation is too often under-estimated compared to the surface circulation, more intuitively considered, but very different from the deeper circulation and, in our case, ineffective in connecting sites located in the inner bays of Marseille. Our study highlights that the transport of particles from the WWTP effluent towards the inner shorelines of the bays of Marseille is not negligible. For each studied event, if we take together all the amounts of particles having connected the 10 vulnerable sites chosen around the northern and southern bays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g008">8</xref>), we obtain the relatively high values of 21.2% and 46.3% in June 2008 and October 2011, respectively. Moreover, the observations at Julio station (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195257.g001">Fig 1</xref>) reveal that the occurrence frequency of the intrusions of the NC on the continental shelf is not so uncommon. In fact, the 3 series of measurements performed at Julio and covering 23 months between February 2012 and April 2015, show an average of 1 to 2 intrusions of the NC per month (A. Petrenko, pers. comm.). The intrusions of the NC on the shelf at sub-surface depths therefore represent a significant health risk in relation to coastal water quality along the shorelines of both the northern and southern bays of Marseille, and seeking greater knowledge in terms of their intensity, frequency and dynamics are ongoing research topics. At present, the analysis of the observations available at Julio station (2012&#x02013;2015) is being processed in relation to the analysis of wind regimes and modeled current fields (A. Petrenko, pers. comm.). More generally, it is clear from our recent experience that enhanced monitoring of the sub-surface circulation, often under-estimated, with bottom-moored ADCP stations, as well as periodic analyses of the POM at sea surface with the stable isotope method, might play a major role in the detection and prediction of health risk episodes in a large number of highly urbanized coastal areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195257.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Source files of computed particle trajectories (ZIP file).</title><p>S1A and S1B (netcdf) correspond to the ICHTHYOP computations of June 2008 and October 2011, respectively.</p><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195257.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Meteo France for meteorological data.
