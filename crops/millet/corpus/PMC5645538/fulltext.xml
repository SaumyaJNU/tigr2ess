When people move from a rural environment to urban areas, and experience improved socio-economic conditions, they are often exposed to a &#x0201c;globalized&#x0201d; Western type diet. Here, we present preliminary observations on the metagenomic scale of microbial changes in small groups of African children belonging to the same ethnicity and living in different environments, compared to children living on the urban area of Florence (Italy). We analyzed dietary habits and, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, gut microbiota profiles from fecal samples of children living in a rural village of Burkina Faso (<italic>n</italic> = 11), of two groups of children living in different urban settings (Nanoro town, <italic>n</italic> = 8; Ouagadougou, the capital city, <italic>n</italic> = 5) and of a group of Italian children (<italic>n</italic> = 13). We observed that when foods of animal origin, those rich in fat and simple sugars are introduced into a traditional African diet, composed of cereals, legumes and vegetables, the gut microbiota profiles changes. Microbiota of rural children retain a geographically unique bacterial reservoir (<italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Treponema</italic>, and <italic>Succinivibrio</italic>), assigned to ferment fiber and polysaccharides from vegetables. Independently of geography and ethnicity, in children living in urban areas these bacterial genera were progressively outcompeted by bacteria more suited to the metabolism of animal protein, fat and sugar rich foods, similarly to Italian children, as resulted by PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States), a predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene. Consequently, we observed a progressive reduction of SCFAs measured by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry, in urban populations, especially in Italian children, respect to rural ones. Our results even if in a limited number of individuals point out that dietary habit modifications in the course of urbanization play a role in shaping gut microbiota, and that ancient microorganisms, such as fiber-degrading bacteria, are at risk of being eliminated by the fast paced globalization of foods and by the advent of westernized lifestyle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>environment</kwd><kwd>urbanization</kwd><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>short chain fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a fundamental process in human life cycle since microbiota&#x02013;host interactions influence health and disease (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Collado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tremaroli and Backhed, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>). Animal and human hosts and their microbiota have co-evolved together over the millennia into a homeostatic and symbiotic relationship.</p><p>Dietary habits are one of the main factors contributing to the diversity of human gut microbiota (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2014</xref>). Dietary changes and gut microbiota alterations have the potential to profoundly affect host health and development (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Agans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ringel-Kulka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In infants, GI colonization is influenced by several factors including genetics, gestational age, mode of birth, diet, environment, sanitation, and antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adlerberth and Wold, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Khodayar-Pardo et al., 2014</xref>). During the first year of life, dietary richness and environmental exposures increase and in parallel, the richness and complexity of the GI microbiota also increase (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>). Early life is a distinctive stage for the microbiota also in terms of functional acquisition (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>). However, microbial colonization in children, following dietary and environmental changes, is still being completely uncovered.</p><p>In the last few years, researchers have gone beyond the Western world, to investigate human populations still living in rural environments and having a lifestyle completely different from that of developed countries. Metagenomic datasets obtained worldwide in different populations show that both host and environmental factors, especially diet, can affect gut microbial ecology over a lifetime (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Borenstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Freilich et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our previous study showed for the first time that gut microbiota from children living in a rural African village in Burkina Faso, an environment resembling that of Neolithic subsistence farmers, is completely different from the microbiota of children living in the urban Western world (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrated that in children different dietary habits (a fiber-rich diet of rural populations versus a typical Western diet rich in fat, animal proteins, and simple sugars) affect the gut microbiota.</p><p>A fiber and plant-derived polysaccharide-rich diet in children and adults is associated with a human gut microbiota enriched in Bacteroidetes phylum compared to Firmicutes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2014</xref>). The fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates stimulates the growth of bacterial producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are associated with disease and health in different ways (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since the publication of our study, the impact of diet on gut microbiota has been observed and reported in different geographically isolated populations, such as Amazonas from Venezuela and rural populations in Malawi (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>) and Papua New Guinea (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, there are reports about drastic and rapid changes in gut microbiota when adults make a dietary switch from carnivorous to vegetarian diets (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>). The study of gut microbiota in ancestral populations, such as Hazda hunter-gatherers from Tanzania, one of the last few remaining populations with a Paleolithic type diet and lifestyle (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schnorr et al., 2014</xref>), showed significant differences in microbiota due to dietary fluctuations linked to seasonal changes. The microbiota of BaAka hunter-gatherers and Bantu agriculturalists is characterized by microbial gradients linked to traditional subsistence strategies (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, the studies on traditional and culturally diverse populations living in isolation from the globalized world showed the degree of an individual&#x02019;s traditional lifestyle and can explain the evolutionary processes of human gut microbiota.</p><p>We hypothesized that in the same country the phenomenon of urbanization, and consequently the &#x0201c;Westernization&#x0201d; may affect dietary habits of traditional populations, resulting in modification of gut microbiota profiles. The aim of the present preliminary investigation was to assess the impact of dietary habits on the gut microbiota of small groups of African children who live in a rural village, with marginal contacts with the globalized world, respect to children living in suburban small town and in an urban area. For such populations who live in the same country and belong to the same ethnic group, such a transition is in parallel with increased wealth and greater food availability.</p><p>We integrated the data on the gut microbiota characterization of our previous study on children living in the rural villages of Boulpon (district of Nanoro) in Burkina Faso (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>), with data on microbiota from children of the same Mossi ethnicity who live in the small town of Nanoro and from those of wealthy families living in Ouagadougou, the capital city. We then compared the composition of the gut microbiota of these three African populations, corresponding to different levels of urbanization, with that of previously known Italian children, as representative of a typical Western and urbanized population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Enrollment of Children Populations and Fecal Sample Collection</title><p>In this study, we enrolled 11 healthy children living in the rural village of Boulpon (Boulkiemde province, Burkina Faso, BR), 8 healthy children living in the small town of Nanoro (Boulkiemde province, Burkina Faso, BT), 5 children living in the capital city of Burkina Faso, and 13 healthy children living in the urban area of Florence, Italy (EU). All children aged 2&#x02013;8 years, had not taken antibiotics or probiotics in the 6 months prior to the sampling dates and had not been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. A detailed medical and lifestyle report was obtained from EU children&#x02019;s parents as well as a 4-day dietary questionnaire and an in-depth interview on African children&#x02019;s diet was obtained directly from their mothers. Additional data were collected for all children (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>) including ethnicity, environment in which they live, and mode of birth (natural or cesarean). All children were breastfeed as infants, except one EU children (1EU) who was formula-fed.</p><p>Despite the high incidence of infectious disease, including malaria and malnutrition in the area, all children were healthy at the time of sample collection.

It is worth of mentioning that the capital city of Ouagadougou is very polluted by vehicle exhaust, especially during the dry season.</p><p>The dietary habits of these three African populations were compared to a population of our previous study comprised of 13 European children (EU) living in Florence (Italy) and having a typical Western diet (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we analyzed the dietary habits and daily food intake of all our pediatric populations, based on dietary questionnaires and interviews with mothers and care givers, estimating average quantities of food ingested per day, food energy (kcal/day), grams of protein, fat, carbohydrates, including simple sugars, and fiber (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>).</p><p>As shown in our previous study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>), the diet of BR children is predominantly vegetarian, rich in fibers and plant-polysaccharides and low in fat, animal protein, and simple sugars (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2A</xref>). The sources of fibers are also quite unique, as derived from locally cultivated indigenous cereals (millet, <italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic> and sorghum, <italic>Sorghum vulgare</italic>), legumes (Nieb&#x000e8;, <italic>Vigna unguiculata</italic>), vegetables (N&#x000e9;r&#x000e9;, <italic>Parkia biglobosa</italic> and baobab leaves), fruits (especially mango, papaya, and bananas), and fermented products (Soumbal&#x000e0; from Ner&#x000e8; seeds; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>). Millet and sorghum, typical cereals of the Burkinab&#x000e8; diet in these rural villages, are frequently still ground into flour on a flat grinding stone, similarly to what humans did during the agriculture revolution in the Neolithic age, to produce a thick porridge called T&#x000f4;, that is the principal dish-component of Burkinab&#x000e8; meals.</p><p>The BT children living in Nanoro town still eat cereals and legumes, similarly to BR children but, depending on their socio-economic status, their diet also contains rice, corn, peanuts, peanut oil, and about once-a-week mutton or chicken from animals bred in the village or dried fish. Unlike the BR population, cereal flour, legumes, fruit, and dried fish can be bought in the local market in Nanoro town, where products from neighboring countries can also be found (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2B</xref>).</p><p>The BC children, living in the capital city of Ouagadougou, eat a typical African diet of cereals (millet, sorghum, rice, soya) and legumes (Nieb&#x000e8;), but also bread, milk and dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, eggs, fruit juices, snacks, sweet bakery products and different kinds of meat and fish, including frozen fish no more than three times <italic>per</italic> week. Their diet, therefore, is very similar to that of children living in an industrialized and globalized world. Many of these products are bought at supermarkets (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2C</xref>).</p><p>The Italian children in our study eat a typical Western diet, high in starch, simple sugars, animal protein, and fat and low in fiber (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2D</xref>), as previously described (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our nutritional analysis of the four populations of children showed that passing from rural (BR) to urban centers (BT, BC, and EU), the variety of food consumed increased (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>), as well as the daily intake of fat, protein and simple sugars, and consequently the daily caloric intake, whereas the fiber intake was progressively reduced (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). The average amount of fiber in the BR diet is 14.2 g/day (3.19% of total grams of daily food intake) compared with 12.5 g/day (2.72%) in the BT diet, 9.7 g/day (1.04%) in the BC, and 8.4 g/day (0.9%) in the EU diet.

LEfSe analysis (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Segata et al., 2011</xref>) performed on PICRUSt output showed several KEGG categories differentially present in the African and European populations (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">6</xref>). In particular, considering KEGG function categories at level 3 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>), among the most representative metabolic functions enriched in the BR metagenome, we observed functions involved in complex carbohydrate metabolism, deriving from foods rich in fiber and polysaccharides, such as glycan biosynthesis, glycosyl transferases, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). These metabolic functions could explain the microbiota abundance of plant polysaccharides-bacteria degraders and the highest levels of SCFAs observed in fecal samples of BR with respect to other urban populations.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Differences in the most representative bacterial functional classes (KEGG categories level 3). <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold> Functional pathways significantly enriched in African and European populations based on PICRUSt prediction.

We could hypothesize that the presence of known fermenting bacteria such as <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>, observed in BC microbiota, can promote functional acquisition related to methane metabolism.</p><p>In the EU metagenome, we found enrichment of KEGG functions deriving from a simple sugar-rich diet. The acquisition of functions related to galactose metabolism, involved in conversion of galactose into glucose (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>), could arise from consumption of dairy products. Other functions enriched in the EU gut microbiota were the biosynthesis of carbohydrates from fatty acids and to sulfur and nitrogen metabolism (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>). Several enteric bacteria produce reduced sulfur and nitrogen by dietary amino acids and animal protein. We supposed that bacteria such as <italic>Bilophila</italic>, found abundantly in EU microbiota, a well-known sulfite-reducing bacterium, could be responsible for this functional contribution.</p><p>In the BC and EU metagenome, we observed enrichment in functions related to consumption of a diet with high fat and animal protein, such as lipid and amino acid metabolism.</p><p>Among the KEGG functional categories, in BC metagenome, we observed enrichment of primary and secondary bile acid biosynthesis (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>). Commensal bacteria deconjugate bile acids, synthesized in the liver from cholesterol-derived precursor molecules, and convert primary into secondary bile acids (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brestoff and Artis, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the BR metagenome, PICRUSt analysis showed several enriched amino acid metabolism (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref></bold>), suggesting a potential ability of BR microbiota to contribute to host metabolic functions in conditions of poor amino acid food intake. The absence of essential amino acids in food, especially in cereals, which are the basis of the African diet, leads to an inability to synthesize protein and ultimately can lead to malnutrition, especially through a syndrome known as Kwashiorkor, which is common among children in these countries. However, the high intake of cereals and legumes in the BR diet could be a source of amino acids, especially glutamate, alanine, and cysteine. Interestingly, one exceptional source of glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid could be the Baobab, whose leaves are added to main Burkinab&#x000e8; dishes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">2</xref>). Similar findings have been observed in the Hazda, one of the last hunter-gatherer populations, who eat Baobab leaves (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schnorr et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the BC metagenome, we found enrichment of aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref></bold>), and in the EU, of metabolism of arginine, proline, valine, leucine, isoleucine, histidine and tryptophan, and lysine biosynthesis and degradation, that may originate from the animal protein-rich food, typical of the Western diet (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref></bold>). In particular, concerning essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAAs, such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine), our results are in agreement with a recently analyzed metagenome of an Italian population (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rampelli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The breakdown of basic amino acids by commensal bacteria is a source of SCFAs, as demonstrated by <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Macfarlane (1997)</xref>. In general, alanine, glycine, and cysteine are fermented by bacteria to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Serine is fermented to acetate and butyrate, while threonine is mainly metabolized to propionate. The main products of methionine metabolism are propionate and butyrate. Interestingly, we found that metabolism of these amino acids was enriched in our BR group, and, together with fiber and polysaccharide fermentation, could contribute to the abundance of SCFAs we observed in their fecal samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>).</p><p>Regarding the more prevalent amino acid metabolism in our EU group, lysine, arginine and deamination of histidine produce butyrate and acetate, while BCAAs are slowly fermented by colonic bacteria. Thus, diet and the functional acquisitions of the bacterial metagenome for metabolism of amino acids or foods rich in fermented fiber and polysaccharides could explain the different levels of SCFAs observed in our studied populations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The first years of life are fundamental for acquiring the gut microbial biodiversity, following dietary changes, and are essential for microbiota&#x02013;host interactions that will later influence the health and disease status in adulthood (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>With respect to our previous work (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Filippo et al., 2010</xref>) and other studies investigating dietary habits and gut microbiota composition in traditional populations (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yatsunenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schnorr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gomez et al., 2016</xref>), this preliminary study although performed in a limited groups of children point out the modification of microbiota composition that occurs in African children belonging to the same ethnicity but living in different environments recapitulating processes occurring over a longer time in the co-evolution of diet, gut microbiota and the host.</p><p>The gradual enrichment of food variety, with an increase in animal protein (meat, fish, and dairy products), processed and refined foods, the increase in fats and reduction in fiber intake, occurring during the Westernization of dietary habits, drastically changes the microbial profiles and functions, especially bacterial lineages able to ferment complex carbohydrates and produce the well-known anti-inflammatory SCFAs, as observed in urban African children. Despite the limited number of samples from children of each African and Italian population, the dramatic differences among groups presented in this study provide preliminary insights into how improved socio-economic level and exposure to globalized foods could rapidly endanger ancient microbial communities able to ferment dietary fiber, and replaced by other bacteria more suited to metabolism of animal protein, fat and simple sugar. Although the limitations of the approach of functional inference by PICRUSt must be considered, as well as the limited number of individuals analyzed, the concordance of observation on the microbiome and the SCFAs profiles, suggest that the observed differences cannot be explained by chance, but rather from variation in fundamental microbial processes.</p><p>These key microbial and metabolic markers that have remained relatively unaltered over 100s of generations in rural Burkina Faso can be considered as reliable indicators of &#x0201c;pristine&#x0201d; microbial patterns, suggesting that dramatic microbial profile losses could occur during the course of urbanization, industrialization, and Westernization.</p><p>It is important to remember that children in rural areas of developing countries are at high risk of infectious disease and malnutrition, either because of lack of sanitation and/or the scarcity of food. This has key implications on policies related to mitigation of malnutrition and famine, as well as health assessment and protection of migrants. On the other hand, the gradual disappearance of &#x0201c;old friends&#x0201d; during the transition from rural to urban environments may also be a danger to the health of industrialized and Western populations, in which non-communicable diseases are widespread, as well-reported by hygiene hypothesis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Rook and Brunet, 2005</xref>). Our results provides, in a preliminary way, a vital piece to the puzzle of the co-evolution of diet, gut microbiota and host, and highlight the importance of developing strategies to preserve microbial functional acquisitions, especially in childhood, that have been lost during the course of urbanization and the economic development of human populations, and that might have important health implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Data deposition: data were submitted to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP000133">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP000133</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19895">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19895</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
