    "Defatted mango kernel seed flour was added to wheat flour for the production of cookies. The protein contents of the wheat-mango kernel flour blend were optimized using optimal mixture design of response surface methodology. The farinograph analysis had acceptable mixing profile at 25%-defatted mango kernel flour incorporation, after which the mixing profile was adversely affected. The pasting temperature was between 65.8 and 75.6Â°C; peak viscosity ranged between 448 and 521 BU while the final viscosity ranged between 594 and 709 BU. The flour blends had promising dynamic rheological characteristics; at 15% incorporation of defatted mango kernel flour, G' was greater than G'' while a stage was reached when G' was equal to G'' at 25% incorporation. At 50% incorporation, G'' was greater than G'. The cookies produced showed high (>70%) quality in terms of physical properties, color, and sensory evaluation at 25% incorporation of defatted mango flour."
