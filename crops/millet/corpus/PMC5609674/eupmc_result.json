    "This study aimed to compare and determine the differences in the physiological, anthropometric and training characteristics of the finishers (FIN) and non-finishers (N-FIN) in a 161-km race. Two groups of runners (FIN; N=12 and N-FIN; N=14) completed a series of anthropometric and physiological measurements over two separate sessions at least three weeks prior to the race. Training sessions starting from six weeks prior to the race were recorded. Sum of 7 skinfolds, arm and calf girths, VO2max and peak treadmill speed (PTS) were taken during session 1 while the lactate threshold (LT) and running economy (RE) were assessed during session 2. Effect size calculations showed moderate and clear differences in the lactate concentration at LT1 (ES = 0.88, P = 0.05), velocity at LT2 (ES = 0.70, P = 0.07), longest run attempted (ES = 0.73, P = 0.07) and number of cross-training hours (ES = 0.73, P = 0.06) between the FIN and N-FIN. The results suggest that from a physiological perspective, the ability to finish a 161-km race might be differentiated by metabolic attributes via LT measurements. Runners should not neglect the importance of the long runs and should incorporate cross-training to provide additional stimuli to the body while allowing the running muscles to recover from fatigue."
