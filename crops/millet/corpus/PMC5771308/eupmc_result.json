    "The term decreased occlusal vertical dimension refers to the reduced distance between two anatomical points while the teeth are in a state of occlusion. The development of this situation is about some parafunctional activities of the masticatory system.To evaluate the value of decreased occlusal vertical dimension in cases with temporomandibular disorder and to follow up the influence of corrective treatment with occlusal splints and definitive prosthetic construction upon the elimination of clinical symptoms.Eight cases with decreased occlusal vertical dimension accompanied with temporomandibular disorders were treated with an occlusal splint, as part of reversible occlusal treatment. After reducing, or complete elimination of the symptoms related to problems of decreased occlusal vertical dimension, the definitive prosthetic therapy was performed.The mean value of decreased occlusal vertical dimension in our patients is 8.5 mm, and the mean value of therapy time with an occlusal splint in these patients was 3.5 months.Occlusal splint is a part of reversible occlusal therapy in cases with decreased occlusal vertical dimension. After reducing the symptoms related to decreased occlusal vertical dimension definitive prosthetic therapy can be done."
