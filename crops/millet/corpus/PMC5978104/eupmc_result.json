    "The disadvantages such as swelling after absorbing water and flammability restrict the widespread applications of lignocellulose composites (LC). Herein, a facile and effective method to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces with flame retardancy on LC has been investigated by coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and stearic acid (STA) modified kaolin (KL) particles. The as-prepared coatings on the LC exhibited a good repellency to water (a contact angle = 156&deg;). Owing to the excellent flame retardancy of kaolin particles, the LC coated with PDMS@STA-KL displayed a good flame retardancy during limiting oxygen index and cone calorimeter tests. After the coating treatment, the limiting oxygen index value of the LC increased to 41.0. Cone calorimetry results indicated that the ignition time of the LC coated with PDMS@STA-KL increased by 40 s compared with that of uncoated LC. Moreover, the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and the total heat release (THR) of LC coated with PDMS@STA-KL reduced by 18.7% and 19.2% compared with those of uncoated LC, respectively. This LC coating with improved water repellency and flame retardancy can be considered as a potential alternative to protect the lignocellulose composite."
