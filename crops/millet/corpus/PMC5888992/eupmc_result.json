    "Many studies support the pro-nociceptive role of brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) in pain processes in the peripheral and central nervous system. We have previously shown that nociceptor-derived BDNF is involved in inflammatory pain. Microglial-derived BDNF has also been shown to be involved in neuropathic pain. However, the distinct contribution of primary afferent-derived BNDF to chronic pain processing remains undetermined. In this study, we used Avil-CreERT2 mice to delete Bdnf from all adult peripheral sensory neurons. Conditional BDNF knockouts were healthy with no sensory neuron loss. Behavioural assays and in vivo electrophysiology indicated that spinal excitability was normal. Following formalin inflammation or neuropathy with a modified Chung model, we observed normal development of acute pain behaviour, but a deficit in second phase formalin-induced nocifensive responses and a reversal of neuropathy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity during the later chronic pain phase in conditional BDNF knockout mice. In contrast, we observed normal development of acute and chronic neuropathic pain in the Seltzer model, indicating differences in the contribution of BDNF to distinct models of neuropathy. We further used a model of hyperalgesic priming to examine the contribution of primary afferent-derived BDNF in the transition from acute to chronic pain, and found that primed BDNF knockout mice do not develop prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity to an inflammatory insult. Our data suggest that BDNF derived from sensory neurons plays a critical role in mediating the transition from acute to chronic pain."
