    "WD40 proteins are scaffolding molecules in protein-protein interactions and play crucial roles in fundamental biological processes. Genome-wide characterization of WD40 proteins in animals has been conducted solely in humans. We retrieved 172 WD40 protein genes in silkworm (BmWD40s) and identified these genes in 7 other insects, 9 vertebrates and 5 nematodes. Comparative analysis revealed that the WD40 protein gene family underwent lineage-specific expansions during animal evolution, but did not undergo significant expansion during insect evolution. The BmWD40s were categorized into five clusters and 12 classes according to the phylogenetic classification and their domain architectures, respectively. Sequence analyses indicated that tandem and segmental duplication played minor roles in producing the current number of BmWD40s, and domain recombination events of multi-domain BmWD40s might have occurred mainly after gene duplication events. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that a higher proportion of BmWD40s was involved in processes, such as binding, transcription-regulation and cellular component biogenesis, compared to all silkworm genes annotated in GO. Microarray-based analysis demonstrated that many BmWD40s had tissue-specific expression and exhibited high and/or sex-related expression during metamorphosis. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the animal WD40 protein family and assist the study of the functions of BmWD40s."
