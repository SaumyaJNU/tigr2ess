In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in &#x003bc;CT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13007-017-0229-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>X-ray micro computed tomography</kwd><kwd>&#x003bc;CT</kwd><kwd>Image analysis</kwd><kwd>3D vision</kwd><kwd>Grain traits</kwd><kwd>Wheat</kwd><kwd>Temperature</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M009459/1</award-id><award-id>BB/M018407/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doonan</surname><given-names>John H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par26">Agriculture is facing major challenges to provide adequate amounts of food in a changing environment. There is a need to produce high-yielding crop varieties under different predicted abiotic stresses. A great deal of progress in generating genomic tools for the major food crops means that the current challenge is to link genetic variation to plant phenotype. Although our ability to analyse phenotype in a comprehensive and automated manner is rapidly developing, we still lack key capacities to analyse phenotypic variation at the population level and thereby dissect the complex genetic and environmental interactions that underpin breeding efforts (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]).</p><p id="Par27">Bread wheat is an important crop in temperate climates, widely used for human consumption and animal feed and a key target in breeding programs. Since domestication some 10,000&#x000a0;years ago in the Fertile Crescent, wheat has become one of the most important food crops worldwide, not only economically but also culturally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Arguably, two of the most important traits during wheat domestication were the increase in grain size and the development of non-shattering seed. Later, during the green revolution, yields were further increased by introducing semi-dwarf alleles with specifically changed plant architecture, including fewer tillers and more compact spikes with more fertile flowers resulting in increased grain number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite the observation that variation in grain shape may affect yield and grain quality including milling and nutritional properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the relationship between spike and grain traits has not been systematically studied; one of the main reasons being that the capture of spike-related grain traits has been labour-intensive, involving painstaking documented destruction of the spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The drive behind the development of an alternative method was to address one of the main climate-change related challenges in contemporary crop research, namely to understand how yield-related grain properties are affected by increased temperatures and limited water. Transient increases in temperature can have a dramatic effect on yield in wheat, particularly if applied at specific stages during flowering when cells are in the early stages of meiosis and at anthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Drought also has a significant impact on wheat yield particularly when applied during the reproductive phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The effect on yield has mainly been attributed to reduced grain number although, for some varieties and at specific growth stages, grain size could increase to compensate for this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Evaluating the effect of stress on grain set and fill traditionally involves threshing the spikes to release the grain, which are then analysed in bulk. The spike is a complex structure in which individual florets are only semi-synchronised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] therefore threshing may discard developmentally relevant information.</p><p id="Par31">Computer vision techniques using both visible and non-visible part of the light spectrum have been used to help evaluate the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on plant growth and are now starting to be used in physiological breeding programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These techniques include growth analysis using visible light imaging, infrared thermography, fluorescence analysis, and spectroscopy imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Other imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been used to study plant traits but their use is not widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is due to the fact that both MRI and PET scanners tend to only be available in hospitals and medical research centres mainly due to the high cost of this equipment as well as their maintenance requirements. Recently NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) was used to determine grain weight and composition on a population scale but this was done on loose grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite these advances, techniques to study the effect of stresses on crop yield, and specifically on grain traits in a fast and non-destructive way that retains positional information, are still largely lacking. Combined with controlled environment growth facilities, these imaging capabilities could offer unparalleled precision in dissecting the effect of environment on phenotype.</p><p id="Par32">X-ray micro computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT) is a non-invasive imaging technique based on differential X-ray attenuation by biological material that may offer a cost-effective alternative. The &#x003bc;CT scanner comprises an X-ray source, a sample rotation stage and an X-ray detector. Attenuation of the X-rays as they pass through the sample is correlated with the density and atomic number of the material and is detected by the image detector as a grey value. Rotation of the beam or of the sample allows for these projections to be acquired from different angles that can be reconstructed as an accurate representation or model of the 3D object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Originally developed as a medical diagnostic tool, recent advances in &#x000b5;CT have led to improvements in scan resolution and quality while reducing scanning time, allowing it to be applied to the study of complex plant traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The capacity to detect and quantify internal structures in a non-invasive and non-destructive way, combined with the ability to automate the process, means that &#x003bc;CT is an attractive approach to study plant traits. High resolution &#x003bc;CT has been successfully used to analyse soil properties, root structure, developing seeds, shoots, developing panicles and leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">However, this approach has not been so widely applied to study general plant traits as might be expected. There are several possible reasons for this. The majority of the &#x003bc;CT hardware and software has been developed and optimised for medical purposes. Most of the available &#x003bc;CT scanners are designed to give high resolution images or to scan large specimens and thus only a few samples can be scanned in a given time. Smaller and bench top scanners are becoming commercially available and overcome some limitations stated above.</p><p id="Par34">At the software level, the available packages have been specifically designed for human biology and material sciences and lack the flexibility necessary to deal with images obtained from different plant organs at different stages of development.</p><p id="Par35">Here, we report on the development of a robust, high-throughput method that allows rapid and accurate feature extraction from &#x003bc;CT images acquired in batches, using a standard benchtop &#x003bc;CT scanner. This method offers many advantages over previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and allows not only to quickly and accurately quantify traditional grain traits like number and size, but also determine grain position along the spike which have previously required destructive and time-consuming dissection. To demonstrate the utility of the approach to address typical research questions, spikes resulting from a multiple stress experiment where plants had been grown under different water regimes and exposed to short periods at different temperatures were examined. Whole spike analyses indicated that grain number along the spike and other grain traits, such as volume, are affected by the treatments. This method is provided in an accessible format with usage instructions and sample data. Finally our method can be used to extract similar features from grass inflorescences with very diverse morphologies, demonstrating its flexibility and potential for wider use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par36">Spring wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv Paragon) was grown as single plants in compost (3.5L Levington F2) in the greenhouse (day temperature set to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and night 15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 14&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;day length) until the sixth leaf stage and then split into 2 equal groups, one watered to 80% field capacity (FC) (high water&#x02014;HW) and one to 40% FC (low water&#x02014;LW). Plants were imaged and gravimetrically watered daily using a LemnaTec Scanlyser system until the primary tiller was at Growth Stage (GS) 39&#x02013;41 (Zadoks scale) which approximates to meiosis (primary tiller was tagged). Plants were then subjected to different temperature regimes as follows: 25/20, 30/25 and 35/30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (day/night set air temperature respectively) for 4&#x000a0;days, and then returned to ambient conditions within the glasshouse to complete their life cycle and ripen. At harvest the primary tiller was weighed and retained for scanning. Other parameters including the total dry weight of the plant and ears and height of the primary tiller were also collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mounting and scanning of material</title><p id="Par37">For each treatment, twelve representative, fully dried primary spikes were selected for scanning and placed in plastic holders (34&#x000a0;mm diameter, 70&#x000a0;mm height). The majority of the spikes were too tall to fit in the holders so they were cut into two pieces and each scanned separately. Pieces of thermoplastic starch were used to eliminate sample movement while scanning. Sample preparation and loading into the scanner takes around 30&#x000a0;min per 12 samples and after this time there is no more user input. The twelve holders were loaded into the sample changing carousel of a &#x003bc;CT100 scanner (Scanco Medical, Switzerland). This scanner has a cone beam X-ray source with power ranging from 20 to 100&#x000a0;kVp (pre-set and calibrated for 45, 55, 70, 90&#x000a0;kVp) and a detector consisting of 3072&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;400 elements (48&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m pitch) and a maximum resolution of 1.25&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m. The samples can be positioned at different distances from the X-ray source greatly improving resolution while keeping scanning time to a minimum. Spikes were scanned with the X-ray power set at 45&#x000a0;kVp and 200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;A with an integration time of 200&#x000a0;ms. Each spike was ~&#x000a0;1000 slices (51 slices per stack), 125 projections/180&#x000b0; were taken and a binning of 6 was used. Output images were produced with a 0.2 megapixel (512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;512) resolution (68.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m/pixel) in a proprietary ISQ file type format (Scanco Medical, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Computer hardware</title><p id="Par38">The 3D volume was reconstructed from the projections (raw data, including flat field correction data) using proprietary software supplied with the Scanco &#x003bc;CT100 scanner.

In order to overcome these issues we developed a high-throughput, automated method using relatively low resolution images acquired from a bench top scanner that is easily applicable to species with diverse spike morphologies and grain sizes.</p><p id="Par43">The initial test population consisted of naturally ripened dry wheat spikes (cv. Paragon) harvested from plants which had been subjected to different defined watering and temperature regimes. Dry spikes were harvested and 12 spikes per treatment were scanned at a resolution of 0.2 megapixel (512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;1000; 68.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m/pixel). This resolution was chosen to allow fast scan times and increase throughput while still retaining sufficient image information necessary for accurate data acquisition and analysis. Scanning time for each spike was around 40&#x000a0;min. We found that performing the scans at higher resolution (1024&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1024&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;2000; 34.4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m/pixel) increased scanning time to 60&#x000a0;min and this did not translate into an increase in the quality of the data output for the analysed grain traits (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Therefore, we chose a resolution of 512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;1000; 68.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m/pixel for routine scans.

The first computational task performed was converting these data into a malleable, workable format. For this, a file-reader in MATLAB (available from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) was developed to generate image stacks. The 3D reconstructed volume as collected from the &#x003bc;CT scanner has a dual peak distribution of grey values and the use of this information has been essential&#x000a0;in constructing an effective method for removing all non-plant material from an image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To further segment the plant material of interest, we developed an adaptive thresholding method that enabled both removal of non-plant material and segmentation of grain and non-grain data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). This developed method relied on taking a cumulative sum of grey values across all slices in a single scan and computing a minimum value for plant material. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Fig. S1 illustrates that material with a density value within the pink shaded area is of interest for this method.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Image segmentation. <bold>a</bold> &#x000b5;CT cross section image of a typical spike in 16-bit greyscale, <bold>b</bold> initial thresholding using our adaptive method, <bold>c</bold> erosion to remove outlying objects using a disk structuring element (SE), <bold>d</bold> median filter applied to smooth and further segment region of interest (ROI), <bold>e</bold> image dilated by same SE as (<bold>c</bold>) and with remaining holder removed and <bold>f</bold> final result of this process was obtained by using (<bold>e</bold>) as a mask in conjunction with (<bold>a</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13007_2017_229_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

A disk shaped structuring element (SE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was used to erode the image, and then we applied a median filter before dilating. This allowed for the removal the majority of the non-target plant material and artefacts of the scanning process and obtain a segmented image (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). From this image a minimum grain size parameter is used to filter out any remaining noise, thus an image is produced containing exclusively grain material. Finding and removing the largest cluster of connected pixels throughout the 3D image allowed elimination of the outer tube used for scanning (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). To precisely preserve the shape of the grains along with the grey levels and ensure that there was no data loss, this segmented black and white image was used to mask the original one (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). After this step, the cleaned image can be used for trait extraction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>3D processing</title><p id="Par48">There is an unavoidable trade-off between image resolution and scanning/processing times. Therefore, acquisition of low resolution images at the expense of image quality enabled us to keep scanning times at a minimum and increase the sample numbers processed. While the information needed for the morphometric analysis is still present in these lower resolution images, there is an increased possibility for objects to be artifactually fused during segmentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Such fused grains were commonly encountered (red circles in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, c) and would be counted and treated as single objects, thus degrading data quality and requiring extensive manual curation. To overcome this problem, a distance-based watershed technique was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This technique was adjusted to work for 3D images by computing, for each white pixel, a distance from the nearest black pixel using a chessboard method for distance measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. With this newly computed distance map a standard watershed algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] was then applied to find dividing contour lines. This allowed for the complete separation of previously fused objects (compare red circled areas in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, c with b, d).

By using 3D reconstructions of whole spikes, the spatial distribution of grains along the spike is maintained and this can be overlaid with the traits measured for each grain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This allows for a visual representation of how grain traits change along the spike and also how the different stresses affect those traits. A high degree of resolution was achieved in the y and z axis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a); this is illustrated by detection of occasional secondary spikelets that protrudes in the y-axis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a circled region). Generally, the middle region of the spike (in the z axis) contains more grains than the top and bottom and grains at the top of the spike are smaller (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b).

As the organs of interest are often embedded within other tissues, the techniques described above require the manual removal of the surrounding tissue.

However, their use necessitates a number of trade-offs between sample number, size and data quality. For example, the loading carousel imposes physical limitations on the size of individual samples and we had to divide many spikes. To re-integrate measurements taken from separate portions of the same spike, we identified conjoining points along the rachis of each spike and rejoining images was introduced as an additional processing step. Further issues can emerge from the use of a fixed X-ray beam which rotates the subject to obtain a 360&#x000b0; image. This gives opportunity for movement during scanning resulting in minor image distortion. To limit movement, scanning material was held in place using thermoplastic starch that, although visible in the scan, can easily be removed by the application of morphological filters during image processing. The time required to produce and reconstruct high resolution scans represents, perhaps, the most serious bottleneck for routine grain analyses. For a wheat spike this can take several hours using typical hardware. To address this, the scans were performed at the lower resolution of 0.2 megapixels (512&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;512) rather than much higher resolutions used in previous studies, for example 5 megapixels (2048&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2048) and larger is often used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

We found that temperature differentially affects grain formation along the spike with the middle of the spike being more sensitive to the stresses. Recent studies have shown that there are two discrete developmental stages where the spike is more sensitive to temperature: early booting when meiosis is occurring and anthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Floret development along the spike is asynchronous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] it is thus tempting to speculate that the florets in the middle were at a temperature-sensitive stage when the stress was applied. In agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] we also found an inverse relationship between grain number and grain volume across treatments. While high temperature and high water regime caused a decrease in the number of grains per spike, the average volume of grains increased, partially compensating for grain loss. It should be noted that the low water plants were slightly ahead in terms of spike development when the heat stress was applied and this could explain why in these plants&#x02019; temperature has a less detrimental effect on grain number per spike. Despite suggestions that grain height, width and depth are affected by independent sets of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], our data indicates that the response of these traits to different growth conditions are highly correlated. It will be informative to extend these studies to diversity and mapping populations to explore how changes in spike architecture and grain traits in response to multiple stresses are genetically controlled.</p><p id="Par70">Finally, to demonstrate the wider applicability of the method, we examined different species (foxtail millet, oats, darnel ryegrass and ryegrass) that illustrate a diversity of inflorescence and grain morphologies, from the dispersed open panicle structure of oats to the very congested structure of millet which has numerous small grains packed together (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).
