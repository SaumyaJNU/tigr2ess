    "Mucoralean invasive fungal infections, while unusual among the general population, have a high mortality rate among immunocompromised individuals who become infected. They are also common spoilage organisms in cultured dairy products, some fresh produce, and baked goods. Additionally, Mucor and Rhizopus spp. are utilized in the production of traditional fermented foods including mold ripened cheeses and fermented soy products. The risk that consumption of these foods poses to immunocompromised consumers has been previously identified. However, actionable guidance on implementation of appropriate dietary restrictions and microbial specification targets for food manufacturers serving these populations is scarce and is limited by insufficient data regarding traceback analysis in cases of invasive fungal infections where food is the suspected transmission vector. Culture-dependent and molecular subtyping methods, including whole genome sequencing, will improve identification of the point source. In turn, the empirically determined information on root-cause can best direct the development of appropriate food safety policies and programs."
