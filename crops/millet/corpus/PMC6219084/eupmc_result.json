    "BACKGROUND:WD40 domains are abundant in eukaryotes, and they are essential subunits of large multiprotein complexes, which serve as scaffolds. WD40 proteins participate in various cellular processes, such as histone modification, transcription regulation, and signal transduction. WD40 proteins are regarded as crucial regulators of plant development processes. However, the systematic identification and analysis of WD40 proteins have yet to be reported in wheat. RESULTS:In this study, a total of 743 WD40 proteins were identified in wheat, and they were grouped into 5 clusters and 11 subfamilies. Their gene structures, chromosomal locations, and evolutionary relationships were analyzed. Among them, 39 and 46 pairs of TaWD40s were distinguished as tandem duplication and segmental duplication genes. The 123 OsWD40s were identified to exhibit synteny with TaWD40s. TaWD40s showed the specific characteristics at the reproductive developmental stage, and numerous TaWD40s were involved in responses to stresses, including cold, heat, drought, and powdery mildew infection pathogen, based on the result of RNA-seq data analysis. The expression profiles of some TaWD40s in wheat seed development were confirmed through qRT-PCR technique. CONCLUSION:In this study, 743 TaWD40s were identified from the wheat genome. As the main driving force of evolution, duplication events were observed, and homologous recombination was another driving force of evolution. The expression profiles of TaWD40s revealed their importance for the growth and development of wheat and their response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our study also provided important information for further functional characterization of some WD40 proteins in wheat."
