    "Setaria viridis (green foxtail) and its domesticated relative S. italica (foxtail millet) are diploid C4 panicoid grasses that are being developed as model systems for studying grass genomics, genetics, development, and evolution. According to archeological evidence, foxtail millet was domesticated from green foxtail approximately 9,000 to 6,000 YBP in China. Under long-term human selection, domesticated foxtail millet developed many traits adapted to human cultivation and agricultural production. In comparison with its wild ancestor, foxtail millet has fewer vegetative branches, reduced grain shattering, delayed flowering time and less photoperiod sensitivity. Foxtail millet is the only present-day crop in the genus Setaria, although archeological records suggest that other species were domesticated and later abandoned in the last 10,000 years. We present an overview of domestication in foxtail millet, by reviewing recent studies on the genetic regulation of several domesticated traits in foxtail millet and discuss how the foxtail millet and green foxtail system could be further developed to both better understand its domestication history, and to provide more tools for future breeding efforts."
