    "Introduction:Multiple bone fractures in a newborn can be associated with osteogenesis imperfect (OI). OI is a rare genetic disorder that causes Type I collagen synthesis disturbance results in bone fragility. Case Report:We present a female newborn which had numerous fractures of the humerus, bilateral clavicle, and bilateral femur. Her delivery was at 36 weeks gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. She had has not any pathological symptom at 2 weeks after birth, the patient had a fracture of the humerus, bilateral clavicle, and femur without any trauma. Genetic analysis of the patient was reported and OI diagnosed. The patient was followed up for 8 months with regularly and without any complication. Conclusion:Multiple fractures with OI in an infant after birth may require an accurate orthopedic plan for diagnosing and treatment."
