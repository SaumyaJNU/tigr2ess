    "Maize was cofermented with pigeon pea for ogi production and evaluated for microbiological qualities. White maize and pigeon pea were mixed at ratios of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50, respectively, with 100:0 serving as the control. Mixtures were cofermented for 96 h at 27 ± 2°C, and microbiological and sensory qualities analyzed were carried out using analysis of variance. Values were significant at p ≤ .05. Results showed that there was a gradual decrease in the pH and increase in total titratable acidity (TTA), respectively, during fermentation in all the samples. At the end of fermentation, pH ranged from 3.47 to 4.27 and TTA ranged from 0.47% to 0.54%, respectively. Total heterotrophic count (THPC) ranged from 5.76 to 5.90 log cfu/g; lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from 6.15 to 5.98 log cfu/g; and yeasts from 5.51 to 5.79 log cfu/g. Microorganisms isolated were lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus buchneri, L. casei, L. pentosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida kefyr, C. krusei, C. tropicalis), molds (Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Penicillium oxalicum, Mucor racemosus and Rhizopus stolonifer) and other aerobic bacteria (Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter amnigenus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Bacillus subtilis, B. firmus, Corynebacterium kutscheri, C. striatum, and C. afermentans). In conclusion, the total heterotrophic plate count (THPC) in fortified maize: pigeon pea products was very high. This could constitute health hazards to infants as weaning foods. However, the microbial loads could be reduced through heat treatment as ogi is usually boiled or treated with boiled water before consumption and it can therefore be concluded that the fortified maize: pigeon pea products could be used as weaning foods."
