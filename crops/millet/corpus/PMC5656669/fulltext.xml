Foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>) is an orphan crop essential to the food security of many small farmers in Asia and Africa and is a model system for other millets. A novel <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation and direct plant regeneration procedure was developed from shoot apex explants and used to downregulate expression of 3 members of the PHT1 phosphate transporter family <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>2 SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>3</italic> and <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>4</italic>. Transformants were recovered with close to 10% efficiency. The downregulation of individual transporters was confirmed by RT-PCR. Downregulation of individual transporters significantly reduced the total and inorganic P contents in shoot and root tissues and increased the number of lateral roots and root hairs showing they have non-redundant roles. Downregulation of <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>2</italic> had the strongest effect on total and inorganic P in shoot and root tissues.

P participates in the structure of nucleotides and phospholipids, and it is also important for many biochemical functions including photosynthesis and respiration. P is important for plant growth and P deficiency affects the growth and yield of several crop plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Plants absorb P from soil solution as inorganic phosphate (Pi), the process is influenced by the soil pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">High reactivity with metal cations and very low mobility of Pi make it highly inaccessible to plants. Hence, organic or synthetic P fertilizers are applied to improve crop yields. Reserves of rock phosphate for the production of inorganic phosphate fertilizers are predicted to be exhausted in next 2 centuries or so<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Further, much of the applied phosphate is also wasted, resulting in environmental damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. So it is imperative to find ways to improve the Pi uptake efficiency of crop plants for sustainable food production.</p><p id="Par4">The principal means of entry of Pi from the soil to plant is through the plasma membrane located PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 1 (PHT1) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Each plant has several members of PHT1 transporters which are found to play key roles not only in P acquisition but also in root to shoot transport and remobilization from mature to young tissues. Since their discovery in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> in 1996&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, members of these transporters have been characterized in several plants including in rice, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Many of the PHT1 members have been found to be induced by low Pi stress in root tissues. Their functions were characterized by heterologous expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Pi transporter deficient mutants and Xenopus oocytes. PHT1 transporters are found to have 12 transmembrane segments and belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Millets are important cereals used as a food and feed in developing countries of Asia and Africa. Foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>) is one of the important millets mostly cultivated in the semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa and has been used as an excellent model species for various genetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Together with its wild relative green foxtail (<italic>Setaria viridis</italic>), it is the only millet with its whole genome sequenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. While the genome sequencing of other millets like finger millet and pearl millet are still in progress due to their larger genome size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, foxtail millet has been considered as an ideal millet to study the functions of PHT1 transporters. Although millets are important cereal crops in less developed countries, they have not been paid much attention for genetic transformation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Even only a few reports are available on the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation of foxtail millet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, in all these reports immature inflorescence was used as initial explants and callus mediated regeneration was adopted to recover the transgenic plants. The callus mediated regeneration is a time consuming process and may also induce soma clonal variations. Hence, development of rapid regeneration protocol is needed for this important model crop following an efficient <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation.</p><p id="Par6">In a previous study, we have analysed the expression patterns of <italic>12 PHT1</italic> transporters of foxtail millet (<italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>1</italic> to <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>12</italic>) as a function of external Pi concentration and in response to colonisation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) <italic>Funneliformis mosseae</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The transporter <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>2</italic> has been found to express in all tissues and at all stages of growth tested while <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>4</italic> was found to be induced by low Pi stress in root tissues. Many transporters were also induced in 15 days old shoot tissues under low Pi condition. Transporters <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>8</italic> and <italic>SiPHT1</italic>;<italic>9</italic> have been found to be induced by AMF colonisation in root tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, functions of these transporters have not yet been studied.</p><p id="Par7">In this article we report a novel <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation system using shoot apex explants with a direct plant regeneration procedure. Yeast complementation studies of some of these transporters was performed in a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae pho84</italic> mutant and the <italic>in planta</italic> functions of 3 transporters (SiPHT1;2, 1;3 and 1;4) studied by downregulation through RNA interference (RNAi). This study will help to understand the role of PHT1 transporters on Pi transport in foxtail millet with a view to improve Pi uptake and efficient utilization under low Pi stress conditions.

To this end an <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation and novel direct regeneration protocol was developed for foxtail millet. Shoot apex explants were initially cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing various concentrations of cytokinins benzylamino purine (BAP), thidiazuron (TDZ) or kinetin (KN) at varied concentrations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The first study on <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation of foxtail millet was reported in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> using immature inflorescence as explants with the transformation frequency of 6.6%.

Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> further optimized the regeneration conditions following the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation of foxtail millet. However, in all these reports immature inflorescence was used as initial explants and callus mediated regeneration was adopted to recover the transgenic plants. The use of immature inflorescence as initial explants may pose some technical difficulties as these explants are not readily available around the year and needs pre-culture of plants. Further, callus mediated regeneration is a time consuming process and may also induce somaclonal variations. Therefore, the combination of an efficient <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation of readily available (shoot apex) explants followed by direct regeneration is a significant advance on current methodology. Shoot apex seems to be an excellent source of explant for regeneration and transformation studies in cereals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.
