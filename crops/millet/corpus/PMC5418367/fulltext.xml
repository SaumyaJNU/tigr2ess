Biofortification, the process of enhancing micronutrient content and bioavailability in staple crops, represents an exciting sustainable food-based strategy to combat and prevent iron deficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this review, we examine the evidence to date of the efficacy of iron-biofortified staple food crops on improving iron status in at-risk populations, including rice, pearl millet, and beans. Three randomized efficacy trials of iron biofortified interventions were included in this analysis, conducted in the Philippines, India, and Rwanda. Iron status (hemoglobin, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), C-reactive protein, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein) was measured at enrollment, midline, and endline in each trial. The primary outcomes evaluated included hemoglobin, serum ferritin, sTfR, and total body iron. A meta-analysis using random effects models was conducted to examine the effects of interventions on hematological outcomes, with the DerSimonian and Laird method. In meta-analyses of data from the three trials, iron-biofortified interventions significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations and total body iron. Evidence to date from randomized trials suggest that iron-biofortified crops are an efficacious intervention to improve iron status. In particular, findings from all three trials also indicate that the effects of biofortified staple crops were highest among individuals who were iron deficient at baseline, suggesting the greatest potential to benefit. Assessment of functional outcomes and consideration of other high-risk populations such as young children, are warranted to elucidate the impact of iron-biofortified interventions on human health.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><boxed-text id="tb0005"><p><bold>Current Opinion in Biotechnology</bold> 2017, <bold>44</bold>:138&#x02013;145</p><p>This review comes from a themed issue on <bold>Food biotechnology</bold></p><p>Edited by <bold>Patrick Stover</bold> and <bold>Saurabh Mehta</bold></p><p>For a complete overview see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09581669/44" id="intr9065"><underline>Issue</underline></ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1016/j.copbio.2017.03.015" id="intr9070"><underline>Editorial</underline></ext-link></p><p>Available online 25th January 2017</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1016/j.copbio.2017.01.003" id="intr0005">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2017.01.003</ext-link></p><p>0958-1669/&#x000a9; 2017 The Authors.

Characteristics of these studies are presented in <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The efficacy of consuming iron-biofortified rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) was examined during a 9-month double-blind randomized feeding trial in 192 religious sisters living in nine convents in metro-Manila, Philippines [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Participants were randomized to consume either iron-biofortified rice (3.21&#x000a0;mg/kg Fe) or a local variety of conventional rice (0.57&#x000a0;mg/kg Fe). The iron-biofortified rice contributed 1.79&#x000a0;mg of iron per day to the diet, compared to 0.37&#x000a0;mg of iron per day from the control rice. At baseline, 28% of women were anemic (hemoglobin &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L) and 34% were iron deficient (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L). In analyses among non-anemic women, iron-biofortified rice increased serum ferritin concentrations (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02) and total body iron (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05), compared to conventional rice. Findings represented a 20% increase after controlling for baseline values and daily rice consumption. Overall, the greatest improvements in iron status were observed in non-anemic women who had the lowest baseline iron status and in individuals who consumed the most iron from rice.</p><p>The second randomized efficacy trial was conducted to determine the effects of consuming iron-biofortified pearl millet (<italic>Pennisetum glaucum</italic>) on iron status, compared to conventional pearl millet, among 246 children (12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years) for six months in rural Maharashtra, India [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13<sup>&#x02022;&#x02022;</sup></xref>]. The iron-biofortified pearl millet contained 87&#x000a0;mg per kilogram of iron, compared to 30&#x000a0;mg per kilogram of iron in the conventional pearl millet. All children received 200&#x02013;300&#x000a0;g of (dry) pearl millet per day in the form of <italic>Bhakri</italic> flatbread during lunch and dinner. Bhakri was prepared two times per day by seven cooks who used only one of two types of pearl millet flour and followed a protocol to standardize <italic>bhakri</italic> diameter, weight, and consistency. Iron status, including hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI), inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), and anthropometric indices were evaluated at enrollment, at four months, and at six months. At baseline, 43% of children were iron deficient (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) and 28% were anemic (hemoglobin &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L). Iron-biofortified pearl millet significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations and total body iron after four months compared to the conventional pearl millet. Among children who were iron deficient at baseline, those who received iron-biofortified pearl millet were 1.64 times more likely to become iron replete by six months compared to those received the control pearl millet (RR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.49, P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). The effects of iron-biofortified pearl millet on iron status were greater among children who were iron deficient at baseline than children who were not iron deficient at baseline, suggesting a greater potential to benefit.

Random serial sampling was used to collect blood during each of the eight middle weeks of the randomized feeding trial. A total of 86% of participants were iron deficient (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) and 36% were anemic (hemoglobin &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L) at baseline.

Total body iron (TBI) was estimated with the approach originally proposed by Cook <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Iron deficiency was defined as serum ferritin less than 15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L for the primary analyses and as TBI less than 0&#x000a0;mg/kg or sTfR greater than 8.3&#x000a0;mg/L in additional analyses.</p><p>Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models (DerSimonian and Laird method), and the weights used are reported in the figures. Models were tested for heterogeneity and analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>Iron deficiency and anemia were common in these populations: at baseline, 31% of participants were anemic (Hb &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L) and 54% were iron deficient (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) in the overall sample. The prevalence of iron deficiency ranged from 34% in the Philippines to 86% in Rwanda (43% in India), and the prevalence of anemia ranged from 28% in the studies in the Philippines and India to 36% in Rwanda.</p><p>In meta-analyses of data from the three trials, iron-biofortified crop interventions significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1.1</xref> ), compared to conventional crops with a mean increase of 1.10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L of serum ferritin (ln&#x000a0;(SF): 0.10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.18; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). Similarly, iron-biofortified crop interventions significantly increased total body iron (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.1</xref> ) during the feeding trials, with a mean increase of 0.43&#x000a0;mg/kg (95% CI: 0.10, 0.76; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). However, there were no statistically significant effects of iron-biofortified interventions on hemoglobin (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.1</xref> ; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.25) or sTfR (data not shown; P&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05) concentrations, compared to conventional crops.</p><p>In analyses of data from the three trials among individuals who were iron deficient (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) at baseline, iron-biofortified crop interventions significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1.2</xref>), compared to conventional crops (ln(SF): 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.24; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). In analyses among individuals who had low total body iron (&#x0003c;0&#x000a0;mg/kg) at baseline, there were no significant increases in TBI in individuals consuming the iron-biofortified crops compared to conventional crops (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 2.2</xref>; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10). In analyses among individuals who were anemic (Hb &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L) at baseline, iron-biofortified crop interventions significantly increased hemoglobin concentrations (<xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Figure 3.2</xref> ) during the feeding trials, compared to conventional crops, with a mean increase of 2.45&#x000a0;g/L (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04).</p><p>In analyses of data among individuals who were not anemic at baseline (Hb &#x02265;120&#x000a0;g/L) iron-biofortified crops significantly increased both serum ferritin concentrations and total body iron, with a mean increase of 1.15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L of serum ferritin (ln(SF): 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.24; P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) (<xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.1</xref> ) and 0.52&#x000a0;mg/kg of total body iron (0.52&#x000a0;mg/kg; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.92; P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) (<xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Figure 4.2</xref> ), respectively.</p><p>Findings from these meta-analyses provide insights into the efficacy of biofortification as a strategy to improve iron status, and may inform future trials and effectiveness studies of the potential benefit of iron-biofortified crops on iron status in different age groups. In particular, findings suggest that the benefits of biofortified stable crops were greatest among individuals who were iron deficient at baseline. Meta-analyses among non-anemic individuals also indicated that non-anemic individuals had a greater benefit in terms of iron status (serum ferritin and TBI), consistent with evidence that absorbed iron is preferentially allocated to iron stores after hemoglobin concentrations are repleted.</p><p>This analysis has several limitations which warrant caution in the interpretation of findings. For example, the diversity of the populations and the interventions in the combined randomized trials represents a potential limitation. Other limitations include only consideration of baseline and endline data for these analyses, as a different sampling scheme was used across the three different randomized trials. This precludes our ability to detect changes between baseline and midline, as observed in the India pearl millet trial, and more sensitive time-to-event analyses within the duration of the follow-up period across randomized trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p>Findings to date from randomized trials suggest that iron-biofortified crops are an efficacious intervention to improve iron status, including serum ferritin and total body iron.
