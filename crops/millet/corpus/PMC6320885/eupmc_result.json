    "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria that stimulates plant growth, and enhances resistance to pathogens and tolerance of salt stress. Instead, the mechanistic basis of drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana induced by FZB42 remains unexplored. Here, we constructed an exopolysaccharide-deficient mutant epsC and determined the role of epsC in FZB42-induced drought tolerance in A. thaliana. Results showed that FZB42 significantly enhanced growth and drought tolerance of Arabidopsis by increasing the survival rate, fresh and dry shoot weights, primary root length, root dry weight, lateral root number, and total lateral root length. Coordinated changes were also observed in cellular defense responses, including elevated concentrations of proline and activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, decreased concentrations of malondialdehyde, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in plants treated with FZB42. The relative expression levels of drought defense-related marker genes, such as RD29A, RD17, ERD1, and LEA14, were also increased in the leaves of FZB42-treated plants. In addition, FZB42 induced the drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by the action of both ethylene and jasmonate, but not abscisic acid. However, plants inoculated with mutant strain epsC were less able to resist drought stress with respect to each of these parameters, indicating that epsC are required for the full benefit of FZB42 inoculation to be gained. Moreover, the mutant strain was less capable of supporting the formation of a biofilm and of colonizing the A. thaliana root. Therefore, epsC is an important factor that allows FZB42 to colonize the roots and induce systemic drought tolerance in Arabidopsis."
