Past droughts in Zimbabwe have had devastating environmental and socio-economic impacts in rural areas where livelihoods mainly depend on agriculture. Over the past few years, many parts of Zimbabwe have been experiencing extreme events. The study sought to address the following objectives to describe smallholder farmers&#x02019; knowledge of climate change variability and change in Chilonga Ward and to explore the potential of cassava production as a climate change adaptation strategy in Chiredzi. An assessment of the impact of cassava production on rural livelihoods as a climate change adaptation strategy was also done. Focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, desk research and observation were the tools used to collect data. The results show that cassava has an extensive root system that can penetrate poor soils which may not support crops like maize. Zimbabwe has to increase cassava production as its tubers can be value added to produce a range of products that include livestock feed and porridge.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the key challenges facing humanity today is climate change. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) indicates that the energy balance within the Earth&#x02019;s climate system has been altered, and this has resulted in significant changes in national, regional and world climate. IPCC (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) has observed increases in average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. In Zimbabwe, climate change presents risks to lives and livelihoods at the individual level and to the economy, and the livelihoods of the poor are highly vulnerable to climate change because of heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture (Brown <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Zimbabwe has not been spared from the effects of climate change (Downing <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The country&#x02019;s annual mean surface temperature has warmed by about 0.4 &#x000b0;C from 1900 to 2000 (Chigwada <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The occurrence and amount of rainfall is becoming increasingly uncertain and the two decades from 1980 have witnessed a trend towards reduced rainfall or heavy rainfall and drought occurring in the same season (GoZ-UNDP/GEF <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Chitiyo and Kasele (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) assert that the most plausible strategy, therefore, is not only crop diversification but also cultivation of alternative low-input crops such as cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta Crantz</italic>), which can tolerate the stressful conditions such as drought, acidity and low soil fertility (Asher, Edwards &#x00026; Howeler <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Challinor et al. <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Cassava is a potentially high yielding root crop of South American origin. It was introduced into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century and into Zimbabwe from Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zaire and Zambia (Carter, Fresco &#x00026; Jones <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). No specific production skills are required to grow cassava, which tolerates drought, acidity and low soil fertility (Asher et al. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Hahn, Reynolds &#x00026; Egbunike <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). It is against this background that this study sought to probe the potential of cassava production as climate change adaptation strategy in Chilonga in Chiredzi, Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Climate change and agriculture</title><p>The IPCC (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) defines climate change as a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise the damage they can cause or taking advantage of opportunities which may arise (IPCC <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Cassava (<italic>M. esculenta</italic>) is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America between 30&#x000b0;N and 30&#x000b0;S (Duangpatra <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; El-Sharkawy <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The total global cassava production in 2009 was about 241 million tonnes, with Africa being the leading producer (FAOSTAT <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Cassava is considered a staple root crop for more than 800 million people living in developing tropical countries (Burns, Johnston &#x00026; Schmitz <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). About 70% of world cassava root production is used for human consumption either directly after cooking or in processed forms. The remaining 30% is used for animal feed and other industrial products, such as starch, glucose and alcohol (El-Sharkawy <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In Brazil and China, cassava is being increasingly used for bioethanol production, while in Nigeria it is a major cash crop earning the country about three billion United States Dollars annually through export of the crop and related products (FAO <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Although cassava requires optimal conditions to achieve high growth rates, it performs well in drought-prone areas and on poor soils and is thus considered one of the most productive tropical crops on marginal lands (Zhang et al. <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In seasonally dry and semi-arid environments with less than 700 mm of annual rain, improved cultivars of cassava can give dry root yields of over 3 tonnes/ha (El-Sharkawy <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Therefore, cassava is often considered an insurance and hence major food security crop for resource-poor smallholder farmers in marginal lands (Kamukondiwa <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Conceptual framework</title><p>Farmers make decisions at the extensive margin (what to produce at site) and intensive margin (how to produce at a site) in order to maximise economic returns. New perspectives in research on climate change adaptation posit that socio-cognitive factors may be important in motivating individuals to take adaptive actions (Frank et al. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Mitchell (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) defines motivation as the degree to which an individual wants and chooses to engage in certain specified behaviour. Motivation theory explains the cognitive and psychological processes that drive actions in order to predict behaviour (Mitchell <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Maslow&#x02019;s hierarchy of needs posits that the underlying needs for all human motivation are on five general levels from the lowest to the highest: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness needs, esteem needs and self-actualisation.</p><p>Motivation cannot be observed or measured directly, but can manifest itself through attitudinal and behavioural measures (Ambrose &#x00026; Kulik <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Behavioural manifestations may include active pursuit and use of information and implementation of adaptations. However, identifying both the generic- and climate-specific elements of smallholder farmers&#x02019; adaptation behaviour is vital in order to facilitate a societal response to the changes that climate scientists have predicted (Sieber et al. <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Tailoring adaptation practices to specific societies may make it possible to offset the adverse impacts of climate change (Fussel 2007). Moreover, assessments of economic adaptations show that in some cases returns on financial investments in adaptation are likely to exceed the returns from a baseline situation (Fussel 2007).</p><p>Nevertheless, the availability of information alone remains unlikely to motivate adaptation (Cash et al. 2002; Patt &#x00026; Schroter <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Individuals seek or receive, manage and interpret information in different ways and then use or reject it. Frank et al. (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) argue that smallholder farmers&#x02019; knowledge is largely a synthesis derived from personal experience, local sources of knowledge and external sources of techno-scientific information. How farmers perceive scientists and their knowledge is likely to affect farmers&#x02019; use of scientific information in making decisions. Cash et al. (2002) argue that at the core of any decision process involving the creation of knowledge, individuals assess the salience, credibility and legitimacy of available information. Cash et al. (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) propose that effective management of these three components of information is central to successful knowledge production and the ability to mobilise knowledge for desired actions.</p><p>Individuals are not only motivated by information about risk but also by their direct experience with loss and harm brought about by living with hazards (Kasperson et al. <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). The process of adaptation is affected by perception of risk and evaluation of information, and also by perception of one&#x02019;s own capacity to adapt or self-efficacy. Motivation theory posits that much of human action can be explained through the concept of perceived self-efficacy, defined by Bandura (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>), as concerned with judgments of how well one can execute courses of actions required to deal with prospective situations. Perceived self-efficacy is positively associated with any behaviour from which a desired outcome is anticipated (Bandura <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Frank et al. (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) argue that smallholder farmers are highly perceptive of climate and its impact on their land and crops. When confronting environmental change, however, local knowledge is not always sufficient in building adaptive capacity. To adapt to change, new information is often needed, in this case information about the changing climate and feasible adaptations of farming practices.</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Cassava production in Africa</title><p>Cassava (<italic>M. esculenta</italic>) is the crop with the highest total production in Africa, with 118 million tonnes of productions across the continent in 2010, contributing significant energy input to the population with an average 196 kcal/capita/day in 2008 (FAO <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Smit and Skinner <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Cassava is a major staple for more than 500 million people in Africa, and is renowned for its drought tolerance and hardiness in stressful environments (El-Sharkawy <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). From the few studies which have quantified the impacts or responses of cassava to climate change, Jarvis et al. (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) found out that cassava is the least affected crop when compared with other major staples such as maize, sorghum and millets. Liu et al. (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) used the Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (GEPIC) model to evaluate impacts on cassava production across sub-Saharan Africa, finding a change in production to 2030 of -2% to +1% depending on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). The results were in agreement with those by Lobell et al. (2008) who found cassava to moderately benefit from climate change by 2030 with an average increase of 1.1% in production from 2000 through the use of statistical models. Jarvis et al. (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) carried out a research on the impacts of climate change on cassava and compared it with other important African staples such as maize, sorghum, millets, potato, common bean and banana and found that cassava is not affected by soil type and changes in weather patterns. Jarvis et al. (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) also found that very few studies have focused on cassava when predicting impacts of climate change on crop production, partly because process-based crop models are not accurate or not available at all (Boote et al. <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Challinor &#x00026; Wheeler <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fermont et al. <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and partly because most research on climate change impact assessment has focused on better documented staples such as maize, wheat and rice (Bakker et al. <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Case studies in Nigeria and Ghana revealed that in Ghana cassava is a major crop with a hectarage under cassava was 387 000 ha in 1986 and increased to 590 000 ha in 1996 (USAID <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). During the same periods, cassava production also increased from about 2.9 million tonnes to 7.11 million tonnes. Cassava is by far the largest agricultural commodity produced in Ghana and represents 22% of Agriculture Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) compared with 5% for maize and 2% for rice (Al-Hassan <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Day et al. <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The 1987/1988 Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) showed that 1.73 million sampled households (83%) were engaged in cassava production compared with 1.74 million (86%) in maize production (FAO <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In Nigeria, Adeniji et al. (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) postulated that almost all farmers in the main cassava belts of the south-eastern, south-western and central zones grow cassava. Cassava intercropped as a main or minor crop. Cassava produced in Nigeria is used for human consumption and less than 5% is used in industries (Adeniji et al. <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Cassava as a food crop fits well into the farming systems of the smallholder farmers in Nigeria because it is available all year round, thus providing household food security (Alderman &#x00026; Higgens <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; FAO <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><sec id="s20005"><title>Cassava production in Zimbabwe</title><p>Cassava production in Zimbabwe only takes place on a very limited scale in Mashonaland West and the crop was identified as having potential for increasing diversification in Zimbabwean agriculture (Kleih <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Cassava can be used as a food security and industrial crop because it is drought tolerant. There is a need to market cassava as an alternative food to the general populace of Zimbabwe, especially those who live in marginal areas which mainly receive less than 250 mm of rain and temperatures above 23 &#x000b0;C. In Zimbabwe, cassava production is negligible and has not been the focus of agriculture policy because more emphasis is put on production of cash crops such as maize and tobacco, of which these do not do well in areas like Chiredzi.</p></sec><sec id="s20006"><title>Zimbabwe&#x02019;s policy and regulatory framework for dealing with climate change in the agricultural and food security sector</title><p>Zimbabwe under the agriculture and food security cluster is currently developing a climate change policy which emanated from the national climate change response strategy.

It is a vast, semi-arid and drought-prone area downstream of the Save and Runde Catchments with altitude generally below 500 m above mean sea level (Unganai <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Chiredzi District borders Mozambique to the east and South Africa to the south &#x02013; extending over an area of 17 629 square kilometres. Chiredzi has a population of 307 436, and an estimate of 276 842 people live in the rural areas of the district (ZIMSTATS <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Average household size is about five people per household. The key features of district include the Save Conservancy, the Gonarezhou National Park and the Manjinji Pan. There are four major rivers: the Save, Runde, Chiredzi and Mwenezi. Chiredzi lies largely in Natural Region V, a region that experiences less than 400 mm rainfall per year in most years (Vincent &#x00026; Thomas <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>). Natural Region V is an extensive farming region characterised by cattle or game ranching. Lovell (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) states that temperatures are always very high in summer (&#x000b1; 39 &#x000b0;C), causing evaporation losses of 10 mm &#x02013; 13 mm per day. Rainfall in Chiredzi decreases from 700 mm in the north to less than 500 mm in the south along the Limpopo Valley (Fewsnet <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; GoZ-UNDP/GEF <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Annual grasses with scattered shrubs and stunted trees are the main vegetation types (Unganai <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Soils are heavy clays. Livestock rearing, of cattle and goats, forms an important component of livelihoods (Wolmer, Sithole &#x00026; Mukamuri <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Sorghum, pearl millet, cowpeas and maize are the dominant food crops grown in the region and red sorghum, cotton and groundnuts are the main cash crops (GOZ/UNDP/EMA <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0009"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s20010"><title>Demographic data</title><p><xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the majority of the respondents were females from the ages 31 to above 51 years old.

Twenty-five percent know cassava and are not cultivating the crop and 22% do not know cassava. Production is still at subsistence level and is for domestic consumption as responded by the 53% that are practicing cassava production. Seventy-eight percent respondents indicated that women were more interested in cassava production than men. This is an indication that women were more motivated to produce cassava and 38% were willing to produce cassava crop on large scale. FAO (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) asserts that in a study that was carried out in Nigeria, it was found out that women play a central role in cassava production, processing and marketing, contributing about 58% of the total agricultural labour in the South West, 67% in the south-east and 58% in the central zones. FAO (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) also added that women are said to be entirely responsible for processing cassava which provides them with additional income-earning opportunities and enhances their ability to contribute to household food security. Cassava was introduced as an adaptation option in Chilonga Ward in 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate through EMA and financially supported by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through Coping with Drought and Climate Change Programme. By 2010, uptake of cassava remained at less than 1% and the low uptake was because of limited planting material, limited knowledge of the crop and extension services.</p><fig id="F0009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Cassava production in Chilonga Ward.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JAMBA-9-348-g009"/></fig></sec><sec id="s20017"><title>Benefits of cassava</title><p>Fifty-three percent respondents who are into cassava production said that benefits of cassava include consumption of both tubers and leaves. Tubers can be stored in the ground after harvesting for as long as 4 months. Cassava can be prepared and processed for consumption in many different ways, either by just boiling the tuber or by drying and grounding it into powder which can be used to cook sadza (thick porridge) or make bread and which can also be fried as chips (Ceballos <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gleadow et al. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref> depicts pictures of demonstration of cultivating cassava, drying of grated cassava, pounding of cassava into meal and fried cassava chips.

Seventy-eight percent of the respondents also indicated that they have limited seed, which is also a limiting factor in large-scale production. Seed is made available through Chiredzi Research Station at a cost and respondents argued that they lacked financial resources to purchase the seed. However, 38% indicated that they were going to get the seed cuttings from the cassava crop in Tamuwanyika Garden in Chilonga. Lack of resources was another limitation that was raised by 78% of the respondents. Fencing material protects the crop from livestock. The respondents echoed that after harvesting of the other crops, cassava will be the only crop that will be green in the fields and, therefore, animals will be attracted to the crop.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues were taken into consideration before, during and after data collection process and the subsequent writing process.</p></sec><sec id="s0021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Smallholder farmers remain vulnerable to climate variability and change in Zimbabwe, given their dependence on rain-fed agriculture. The farmers are aware of the changing weather patterns, major causes of change, as well as their impacts within their localities and are thus attributing this to climate change. The perception of smallholder farmers that climate is changing is supported by observables such as changes in rainfall amounts, rainfall distribution, onset and cessation of rains and average temperature. Conservation agriculture and production of drought-tolerant crops that thrive in all soil types are some of the major adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers (Herrera Campo, Hyman &#x00026; Bellotti <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Food security is increased in such areas once drought-tolerant crops such as cassava are grown.</p><p>In light of the above conclusions, the study recommends the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There is a need for policy makers to review Zimbabwe&#x02019;s agricultural policy so that it can encourage production of crops such as cassava. Given the increased frequency of extreme weather events induced by climate change, creating a framework for targeted adaptation is crucial to protect people&#x02019;s livelihoods in marginal areas such as the Chiredzi District.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Farmers willing to grow cassava should be assisted with fencing material and seed; this can be on a loan basis with attractive repayment plan such as payment after sale of harvested produce.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Farmers, EMA, AGRITEX, Meteorological Services Department (MSD), Livestock Extension Officers and the Rural District Council Officers should invest in climate change adaptation strategies, training and initiation of cassava production.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The issue of cultivating drought-tolerant crops is not yet a policy, but since independence in 1980 the Government of Zimbabwe has been encouraging farmers to grow cash crops such as tobacco. Instead, the drafting of a climate change policy should be expedited so that the growing of drought-tolerant crops such as cassava could become a major thrust. Adaptation is influenced to a certain extent by governmental actions.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the GoZ/UNDP/GEF (2008&#x02013;2012), and the Coping with Drought and Climate Change Project which invoked our thirst to undertake this research.</p><sec id="s20022" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no financial or personal relationships that may have inappropriately influenced them in writing this article.</p></sec><sec id="s20023"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>T.M. mooted the topic idea when her dissertation was supervised by V.I.T.
