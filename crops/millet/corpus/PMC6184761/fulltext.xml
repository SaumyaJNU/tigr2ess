In maize PBs, 16-kD &#x003b3;-zein locates at the interface between a core of alcohol-soluble &#x003b1;-zeins and the outermost layer mainly composed of the reduced-soluble 27-kD &#x003b3;-zein. 16-kD &#x003b3;-zein originates from 27-kD &#x003b3;-zein upon whole-genome duplication and is mainly characterized by deletions in the N-terminal domain that eliminate most Pro-rich repeats and part of the Cys residues involved in inter-chain bonds. 27-kD &#x003b3;-zein also forms insoluble PBs when expressed in transgenic vegetative tissues. We show that in Arabidopsis leaves, 16-kD &#x003b3;-zein assembles into disulfide-linked polymers that fail to efficiently become insoluble. Instead of forming PBs, these polymers accumulate as very unusual threads that markedly enlarge the ER lumen, resembling amyloid-like fibers. Domain-swapping between the two &#x003b3;-zeins indicates that the N-terminal region of 16-kD &#x003b3;-zein has a dominant effect in preventing full insolubilization. Therefore, a newly evolved prolamin has lost the ability to form homotypic PBs, and has acquired a new function in the assembly of natural, heteropolymeric PBs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cereal seeds</kwd><kwd>disulfide bonds</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>genome-wide duplication</kwd><kwd>neofunctionalization</kwd><kwd>prolamins</kwd><kwd>protein bodies</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prolamins are present only in the seeds of grasses, where they are usually the main proteins, and thus constitute the major global source of food protein (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shewry and Halford, 2002</xref>). Their most striking and unique cell biology feature is their accumulation within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as very large heteropolymers, termed protein bodies (PBs; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shewry and Halford, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pedrazzini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Most proteins that enter the ER are destined to be secreted or sorted to distal locations of the endomembrane system, whereas ER residents, which are mainly folding helpers, have specific amino acid signals that allow their retention/retrieval in the ER (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Navarro and Miller, 2016</xref>). Since these signals are not present in prolamins, the question arises as to what are the molecular features that determine prolamin ER residence and ordered PB formation.</p><p>Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) prolamins are divided into four classes: &#x003b1;-zeins (&#x0003e;30 genes), &#x003b3;-zeins (three genes), and &#x003b4;-zeins and &#x003b2;-zeins (both single genes; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Woo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Messing, 2008</xref>). 27-kD &#x003b3;-zein and &#x003b2;-zein are the oldest maize prolamins (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Messing, 2008</xref>). Whole-genome duplications (WGD), particularly common in plants (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Jiao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), are followed by rearrangements that can lead to gene loss or retention. In the latter case, functional buffering or neofunctionalization can occur, and play important roles in evolution (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chapman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Kassahn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). About 5&#x02013;12 million years ago, maize underwent WGD followed by allotetraploidization (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Swigon&#x002c7;ov&#x000e1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). As a result, &#x003b3;-zein, originally a single gene encoding a polypeptide of 27-kD and one of the most ancient maize prolamins, now has representatives in homologous regions of chromosome 7 (27- and 50-kD &#x003b3;-zein; hereafter referred to as 27&#x003b3;z and 50&#x003b3;z) and chromosome 2 (16-kD &#x003b3;-zein; 16&#x003b3;z). 16&#x003b3;z most probably originates from duplication of the 27&#x003b3;z gene followed by deletion events (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Messing, 2008</xref>).</p><p>During endosperm development, &#x003b3;- and &#x003b2;-zeins are synthesized first, forming a PB where &#x003b1;- and &#x003b4;-zeins will later accumulate (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lending and Larkins, 1989</xref>). In the mature PB, &#x003b2;-zein, 27&#x003b3;z, and 50&#x003b3;z form the outer layer in contact with the luminal face of the ER membrane, whereas &#x003b1;- and &#x003b4;-zeins form the inner core, with 16&#x003b3;z located at the interface between the core and the outer layer (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lending and Larkins, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Yeast two-hybrid data suggest that 16&#x003b3;z can interact with zeins of all classes (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). 27&#x003b3;z expressed in vegetative tissues of transgenic plants forms homotypic PBs, indicating that no specific features of the maize endosperm ER are necessary to form a PB (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Geli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). The primary sequence of 27&#x003b3;z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) consists of the transient signal peptide for translocation into the ER (co-translationally removed), followed by a region containing eight or seven (depending on the maize variety) repeats of the hexapeptide PPPVHL and seven Cys residues involved in inter-chain bonds that make the protein insoluble in non-reducing conditions, and finally a second region homologous to 2S albumins, which are vacuolar storage proteins present in various amounts in all land plants (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Vitale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Prat <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Mainieri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). 2S albumins belong to a larger class characterized by the eight-cysteine motif, consisting of four intra-chain disulfide bonds between three helical domains (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pedrazzini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This motif is also conserved in 27&#x003b3;z (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ems-McClung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Progressive Cys-to-Ser mutation of the seven Cys residues of the N-terminal region lead to increased solubility and a parallel increase in the ability to leave the ER along the secretory pathway (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Mainieri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). When the N-terminal region including the first six Cys residues is fused at the C-terminus of phaseolin, the vacuolar 7S storage globulin of common bean, the chimeric protein zeolin formed homotypic PBs in the ER (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mainieri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Zeolin was instead efficiently secreted upon <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment with a reducing agent, or when its six Cys residues were mutated to Ser (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Pompa and Vitale, 2006</xref>). Overall, these studies indicate that the N-terminal region of 27&#x003b3;z contains key information for PB assembly and that its Cys residues are necessary for this process.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram and amino acid sequence of the 27-kD and 16-kD &#x003b3;-zein primary translation products.

Additionally, its C-terminal region has lost one Cys residue of the eight-cysteine motif and has acquired a new one near the C-terminus, resulting in a new CysProCys sequence. This tripeptide could form an intra-chain disulfide bond (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>); however, it is not known whether this occurs in 16&#x003b3;z. The changes that have generated 16&#x003b3;z are noteworthy, since Cys residues are rarely lost once acquired during evolution (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Feyertag and Alvarez-Ponce, 2017</xref>). 16&#x003b3;z can thus provide information on the minimal requirements for PB biogenesis and the features that allow the formation of heteropolymeric maize PBs. Here, we show that, unlike 27&#x003b3;z, ectopically expressed 16&#x003b3;z remains in part soluble, mainly because of the mutations in the N-terminal region. 16&#x003b3;z is unable to form PBs, but it stably accumulates as polymers that markedly enlarge the ER lumen, giving rise to very unusual filamentous structures. These characteristics indicate neofunctionalization after WGD and cast light on the molecular basis for the specific organization of maize PBs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Analysis of maize PBs</title><p>Seeds from <italic>Zea mays</italic> inbred line W64A, collected at 25 d post-pollination and stored at &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C, were homogenized in a mortar using 5 ml g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ice-cold 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1.0 mM EDTA (buffer H), 7% (w/w) sucrose, and cOmplete&#x02122; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche).

The lumen of the ER dilatations contained very extensive electron-dense structures of two forms: very electron-opaque, osmiophilic threads of various lengths and irregular orientation (well represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>) were mainly observed, whereas a minor proportion formed more compact irregular structures of lighter electron-density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>, enlarged inset, and more evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref>).

After pulse labelling for 1 h with a mixture of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met and [<sup>35</sup>S]Cys, protoplasts were subjected to chase for 0, 4, or 8 h. At each time-point, protoplasts were directly extracted in reducing conditions (thus solubilizing all molecules of each construct, to measure synthesis and stability; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">B</xref>) or sequentially extracted: first in non-reducing buffer and then treating the insoluble material with reducing buffer (to calculate at each time-point the percentage of molecules that are insoluble unless reduced, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>). Each extract was immunoselected with anti-FLAG antibody and analysed using SDS-PAGE and radiography. Newly synthesized 16&#x003b3;zf and 27&#x003b3;zf had the expected molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>). 16&#x003b3;zf was slightly more stable during the chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>; data are from two fully independent experiments).

Since most of the molecular mass difference between the two zeins is due to their N-terminal domain, the SDS-PAGE migrations of 27/16 and 16/27 are similar to those of 27&#x003b3;zf and 16&#x003b3;zf, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>).

This led to the assembly in PBs and a change in the subcellular compartment used for permanent accumulation from the vacuole to the ER, particularly in rice and panicoid cereals such as maize, sorghum, and millet (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lending and Larkins, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Shewry and Halford, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>16&#x003b3;z originated upon maize WGD (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Messing, 2008</xref>) and it is mainly characterized by deletions in the N-terminal region of 27&#x003b3;z, the most ancient &#x003b3;-zein. We have shown here that recombinant 16&#x003b3;zf ectopically expressed in vegetative tissues accumulated within the ER, forming unusual structures. These did not resemble PBs or other ER-located polymers formed by natural or recombinant proteins expressed in plants (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bagga <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mainieri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">de Virgilio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Conley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Torrent <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Llop-Tous <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). 16&#x003b3;zf structures mainly consisted of extensive, convoluted but well-defined filamentous threads; more rarely, the enlarged ER also contained irregular, homogenously electron-dense sectors, which may represent the proportion of 16&#x003b3;zf that had become insoluble. At the onset of prolamin accumulation, initial irregular dilatations along the ER have been observed in rice, but with diameters below 1 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Kawagoe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). 8S globulin, a mung bean vacuolar storage protein, forms 0.2&#x02013;0.6 &#x003bc;m ER enlargements in transgenic tobacco BY2 cells and, as a GFP fusion, in Arabidopsis vegetative tissues and young developing seeds, to be correctly deposited in Arabidopsis storage vacuoles only at later seed development (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The sizes of these ER structures are one order of magnitude smaller compared the dilatations caused by 16&#x003b3;zf. Wider, irregular ER enlargements are formed by the expression of the N-terminal region of 27&#x003b3;z in Arabidopsis, but these have homogeneous electron density, with no signs of filaments (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Geli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). PBs formed by chimeric fusions containing spider elastin-like polypeptides can have a loosely packed content, but they are round and rarely larger than 3 &#x003bc;m, with no well-defined filaments (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Conley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Phan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Thus, the unusual structures that we found formed by 16&#x003b3;zf markedly differed from 27&#x003b3;zf PBs and from ER enlargements formed by various other storage proteins at early stages of seed development or by protein fusions that polymerize in the ER.</p><p>However, 16&#x003b3;zf threads strikingly resemble those formed by diabetes insipidus-inducing mutants of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin precursor (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Birk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beuret <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). These dominant mutations can be in different locations along the precursor, but they all result in abnormal inter-chain disulfide bonds leading to oligomerization and, in some cases, partial resistance to denaturation by SDS/reducing agent, whereas the normal precursor has eight intra-chain bonds. The misfolded precursors thus accumulate in the ER instead of trafficking to secretory granules and form irregularly packed electron-dense filaments, which in some cases coalesce in more uniformly electron-dense regions, similar to 16&#x003b3;zf. Although the mutated precursors seem unable to form canonical amyloid cross-&#x003b2;-sheets, their ability to form fibers resembles amyloid aggregation (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Beuret <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicated that 16&#x003b3;zf was not a structurally defective protein rapidly degraded by ER quality control. 16&#x003b3;zf threads were disulfide-bonded polymers that remained partially soluble in oxidizing conditions, unlike 27&#x003b3;zf polymers. Only when the two recombinant zeins were co-expressed, 16&#x003b3;zf become fully insoluble unless reduced, indicating direct interactions with 27&#x003b3;zf. 16&#x003b3;z present in natural maize PBs was in part solubilized by alcohol together with &#x003b1;-zeins, but no alcohol-soluble 16&#x003b3;zf was detected in transgenic Arabidopsis or upon transient co-expression with 27&#x003b3;zf. This supports the hypothesis that, in maize, at least one of the alcohol-soluble &#x003b1;-zeins directly interacts with16&#x003b3;z, consistent with the location of 16&#x003b3;z in natural PBs (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Lending and Larkins, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and the results of yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). A specific role of 16&#x003b3;z in natural, heterotypic PB assembly is also supported by the characteristics of two maize mutations with opaque endosperm, <italic>mucronate</italic> and <italic>opaque10</italic>. <italic>mucronate</italic> is a frameshift mutation that completely changes the 16&#x003b3;z sequence for the last 63 amino acids, abolishes its solubility in 70% ethanol supplemented with 2-ME, and markedly weakens the interaction with 22-kD &#x003b1;-zein (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In <italic>mucronate</italic> seeds, the overall amount of zeins is reduced (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Salamini <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>) and PBs have angular deformations that often interrupt the outer layer, indicating defects in the organization of the interface between &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-zeins (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Boston, 1992</xref>). <italic>opaque10</italic> is a frameshift mutation generating a premature stop codon in a cereal-specific protein located in PBs (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). <italic>opaque10</italic> PBs are misshaped and often irregularly elongated. The ordered localizations of 16&#x003b3;z and of the 22-kD &#x003b1;-zein that is normally located next to it are disrupted, and the two zeins are dispersed in the PB (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). RNAi, used to inhibit the synthesis of &#x003b3;-zeins in maize, also causes PB misshaping and angular deformations (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Messing, 2010</xref>). A specific role of 16&#x003b3;z could not be established in this case, since the synthesis of both the 27- and 16-kD polypeptides was almost fully inhibited. However, RNAi in which the synthesis of 16&#x003b3;z, 50&#x003b3;z, and &#x003b2;-zein was concomitantly suppressed indicated that these proteins are mainly involved in PB expansion, whereas 27&#x003b3;-zein controls PB initiation and shape, consistent with our data in transgenic Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>), a very close relative of maize (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Swigo&#x00148;ov&#x000e1; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), has not undergone WGD and contains only two genes belonging to the same prolamin II group of &#x003b3;-zeins, <italic>kafirin2&#x003b3;27</italic> and <italic>kafirin2&#x003b3;50</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Belton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Messing, 2009</xref>), and is therefore lacking a 16&#x003b3;z orthologue. Similar to &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-zeins, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-kafirins form the more electron-dense structures of the PB; however, these are not limited to the PB periphery and are also concentrated in the central core or form patches within the less-dense regions (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Shull <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). This lack of organization in layers with clear boundaries between dense and less-dense regions (the latter mainly containing &#x003b1;-type prolamins), compared to maize PBs may thus be related to the absence of a 16&#x003b3;z-like prolamin.</p><p>Our domain-exchange results suggested that the different behavior of the two &#x003b3;-zeins was mainly due to their N-terminal domains. A synthetic version of the (VHLPPP)<sub>8</sub> repeated segment has an amphipathic polyproline II structure and <italic>in vitro</italic> affinity to liposomes that partially mimics the lipid composition of the plant ER, suggesting that the repeat may favor interaction of 27&#x003b3;z with the inner surface of the ER membrane (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kogan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The Zera sequence is a 27&#x003b3;z portion almost identical to the one used to construct zeolin and, like zeolin, it determines PB formation in a Cys-dependent fashion when fused to a number of proteins (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Torrent <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In a Zera-fluorescent protein fusion, progressive deletion of the Pro-rich hexapeptides leads to progressively increased secretion and reduced PB size but does not alter their spherical shape (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Llop-Tous <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), indicating that the peculiar structures formed by 16&#x003b3;z are not simply due to the loss of repeats. Indeed, the N-terminal region of 16&#x003b3;z has also lost three Cys residues and contains two degenerated Pro-rich sequences containing two new Tyr residues&#x02014;aromatic amino acids inhibit the formation of polyproline II helices (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Zondlo, 2012</xref>)&#x02014;as well as other aromatic amino acids and a new Gln-rich short sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In combination, these features may have abolished the ability to interact orderly with lipids and determined the formation of rod-like polymers involved in stabilizing the &#x003b3;-zein/&#x003b1;-zein interface.</p><p>Proteins containing disulfide bonds generally have higher evolutionary rates (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Feyertag and Alvarez-Ponce, 2017</xref>). Intra-chain disulfides probably stabilize important conformations and thus have a buffering, chaperone-like effect that makes the polypeptide more tolerant to mutations; thus, once acquired, inter-chain disulfides are rarely changed (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Feyertag and Alvarez-Ponce, 2017</xref>). Unpaired Cys residues are also relatively more conserved than other amino acids (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The major deletion and the mutations generating 16&#x003b3;z have eliminated a number of 27&#x003b3;z cysteine residues and have altered the biochemical and polymerization properties of the prolamin, but they have not caused gross misfolding and degradation by quality control. They have instead promoted a new role of the protein and a new PB organization.</p><p>Prolamins form peculiar heteropolymers. Analysis of many prolamin polypeptides and their positioning within a PB in different grasses indicates that a high genetic variability is tolerated, probably because PB function is simply constituted by the high accumulation of reduced nitrogen in the first compartment of the secretory pathway. However, within an individual species, certain requirements for optimal PB assembly exist, as indicated by the many natural and artificial cereal mutants analysed. We have shown here that an apparently defective zein polypeptide, generated upon maize whole-genome duplication, forms very unusual structures that may explain its specific structural role at the interface between the ancient and the more recently evolved maize prolamins. The organization of 16&#x003b3;z structures resembles abnormally disulfide-linked, amyloid-like fibers formed by pathological mutants of a human hormone precursor. It thus appears that mutations giving rise to similar abnormal structures within the ER can result in pathogenic loss of function in one case but can be exploited in a developmental process in another.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s18"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
