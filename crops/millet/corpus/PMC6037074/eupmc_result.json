    "Improper disposal of herb residues in China has caused severe problems to the surrounding environment and human safety. Three herb residues, i.e., compound Kushen injection residues (CKI) and part one and part two of Qizhitongluo Capsule residues (QC1 and QC2, respectively), were used for the cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus. The effect of the supplementation of corncobs (CC) with different herb residues on yield, nutritional composition, and antioxidant activity of P. ostreatus was investigated. Compared to the control, the higher mycelial growth rate was observed on substrates CC +30% CKI and CC +30% QC1, while the higher yield was obtained from substrates CC +30% QC2 and CC +30% CKI. Moreover, chemical analysis of fruit bodies revealed that the addition of herb residues to CC significantly increased proteins, amino acids, ashes, minerals (Na and Ca), and total phenolic contents but significantly reduced carbohydrates and IC50 values of DPPH radicals. In addition, no heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and As) were detected in the fruiting bodies harvested from different substrate combinations. These results demonstrated that mixtures of CC with herb residues might be utilized as a novel, practical, and easily available substrate for the cultivation of P. ostreatus, which is beneficial for the effective management of herb residues."
