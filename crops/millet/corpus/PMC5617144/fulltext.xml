We identified 1,245 proteins in all experiments, of which only 45 had been previously annotated. Among overlapping proteins between three biological replicates, 598 proteins with 2 unique peptides identified were reliably quantified. The protein datasets were classified into 36 GO functional terms, and the photosynthesis term was most significantly enriched. A total of 113 proteins were defined as being differentially expressed during leaf development; 41 proteins were found to be differently expressed between two and four week old leaves, and 84 proteins were found to be differently expressed between two and six week old leaves, respectively. Cluster analysis of the data revealed dynamic proteomes. Proteins annotated as electron carrier activity were greatly enriched in the peak expression profiles, and photosynthesis proteins were negatively modulated along the whole time course. This dataset will serve as the foundation for a systems biology approach to understanding photosynthetic development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Natural science fund for distinguished young scholars of Hebei Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>C2014301035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31100880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>the Key Project of the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>C2012301020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hebei Province (C2014301035), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31100880), the Key Project of the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (C2012301020).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is an important oil and grain crop and is also the world's most important source of edible vegetable oil and vegetable protein[<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Soybean seeds are rich in protein, fat, and other nutritional compounds including isoflavones and oligosaccharides[<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With the increasing gulf between supply and demand, fully tapping yield potential and producing elite, high yielding, high quality soybean cultivars is essential for production[<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Photosynthetic efficiency directly affects soybean production, so understanding the dynamic development of the leaf is of singular importance.</p><p>As the leaf is so important to the basic functions of plant growth including photosynthesis, transpiration, and respiration, it has been the focus of widespread and continuing research. The cell-specific transcriptomes of successive developmental stages were compared in bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M) cells of maize leaves [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the results showed that the number of genes preferentially transcribed in one or another cell type varies greatly between the different stages of leaf development. The transcriptome of maize leaves were analyzed using Illumina sequencing, the results quantified transcript abundance along a leaf developmental gradient in mature BS and M cells [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Differential gene expression analysis was performed in soybean leaf tissues at late developmental stages under drought stress showing that the down regulation of many photosynthesis-related genes can contribute to retardation of growth under drought stress which may serve as an adaptive mechanism for plant survival[<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the research relevant to the dynamic development of soybean leaves is still lacking.</p><p>Studying proteins to reveal gene function and the nature of biological phenomena is important. However, biological proteins are complex, and each cell generally has thousands of proteins. Therefore, a technique capable of separating large number of proteins simultaneously is required. Proteomics is a recent developing technology which could be useful for the large-scale, comprehensive study of protein structure, modification, action and expression in cells and tissue [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Comparative proteomics is the identification of differences and changes in the proteome between states, tissue types, and environments. On one level, this provides the tools and methods for studying the function of life and physiological and pathological phenomena, but these same tools can also be applied to examine the basic laws of life [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There are many methods for proteomics research. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) is the main method for separating proteins due to its simplicity and is widely used in various plants proteomics. However, 2-DE results are not sufficiently accurate with some proteins being easily lost and others hard to detect in low abundance [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Compared with 2-DE, isotope affinity tag (ICAT) technology significantly improves the ease of separating membrane proteins, can be combined with high performance liquid chromatography, and provides protein isolation results which are more accurate and reliable. However, ICAT technology applies only to proteins containing cysteine residues and identifying small molecule peptides is difficult [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) is a high-throughput method which can be used to study the relative and absolute quantification of 2&#x02013;8 samples at the same time with good accuracy and repeatability. iTRAQ is one of the most widely used markers in comparison proteomics [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The research technology of iTRAQ quantitative protein has high sensitivity and can identify any type of protein. iTRAQ does not affect protein physical and chemical properties such as the isoelectric point, abundance of the protein itself, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity. At the same time, iTRAQ can detect alkaline, hydrophobic, high or low molecular weight, and low abundance proteins which are difficult to detect using 2-DE. In protein quantitative experiments using iTRAQ, more than 97% of the peptides can be marked efficiently and completely with high repeatability. In addition, through direct tandem application with the mass spectrum, iTRAQ can be automated saving time and effort with a fast reaction rate. All in all, iTRAQ is a good technique to study the plant protein quantity.</p><p>In our previously study, we compared leaf proteome specifically the photosynthetic protein expression patterns, between Hobbit and JD17 at same developmental stage [<xref rid="pone.0181910.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this research, we compared the protein different expression profiles in three important growth periods of Zao 5241, like V2 (second Trifolicate), R1 (beginning flowering) and R3 (beginning pod). Moreover, we analyzed enriched expressed proteins and revealed dynamic proteomes by cluster analysis. The results reported here represent a necessary step toward providing a useful tool and information for isolating proteins and better understanding the molecular basis underlying developmental dynamics in soybean.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant growth conditions and tissue collection</title><p>Zao 5241 is one of the most important elite germplasm lines for soybean breeding in the Huang-Huai-Hai region incorporating foreign descent such as Yanli from Japan and Williams from the United States.

Then, samples were incubated at -20&#x000b0;C for 2 h after thorough mixing. Proteins were collected by centrifuging at 30,000 g and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed. To reduce acidity, the protein pellets were re-suspended with precooled acetone and centrifuged again at 20,000 g and 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. They were then washed 3 times with cold acetone and re-suspended in 1 ml protein extraction reagent [8 M urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 30 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT], the protein was resolubilized through sonication in an ultrasonic cleaner (SCIENTZ, SB4200D). The supernatant was collected after centrifuging at 20,000 g at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Protein concentration was determined using a 2-D Quant Kit (General Electric Company, USA).

Nine Peptide samples labeled were divided into two iTRAQ groups, each iTRAQ groups were carried out independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181910.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Three independent biological experiments were performed.

In total, 38 fractions were collected and combined into 17 fractions to reduce peptide complexity. Subsequently, eluted fractions were lyophilized in a centrifugal speed vacuum concentrator and dissolved with 0.1% formic acid prior to reverse-phase nanoflow liquid chromatography (nLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>MS/MS analysis</title><p>MS/MS analysis was performed on an Easy Nano-LC system (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) connected to a hybrid qradrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MircOTOF-Q II, Bruker, Germany) equipped with a nano electrospray ion source. Peptides of each fraction were equalized before being injected into the Nano-LC-system. The peptides were separated on a C18 analytical reverse phase column of 75&#x003bc;m i.d.x100mm length with Solution A (5% acetonitrile, v/v, 0.1% formic acid, v/v), and Solution B (95% acetonitrile, v/v, 0.1% formic acid, v/v) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.

In the present study, an iTRAQ-based proteomic technique was used to assess proteomic changes and identify proteins which were differentially expressed during soybean leaf development. In total, 1,245 proteins were identified. Data from three biological replicates were analyzed and proteins detected by querying data with a soybean protein database. Although soybean protein annotation is limited, a total of 58 proteins out of 598 were annotated with photosynthesis, and 31 proteins were classified as electron transport chain. Pathway analysis showed that photosynthesis was the most enriched pathway followed by carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and photosynthesis. Differential proteomic analysis of grapevine leaves revealed responses to heat stress and subsequent recovery by iTRAQ. One hundred and seventy-four proteins were differentially expressed under heat stress and/or during the recovery phase, in comparison to unstressed controls. Based on MapMan ontology, functional categories for these dysregulated proteins included mainly photosynthesis (about 20%), proteins (13%), and stress (8%). some proteins related to electron transport chain of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, HSPs and other stress response proteins, and glycolysis may play key roles in enhancing grapevine adaptation to and recovery capacity from heat stress. In our preliminary research, proteomic analysis of two soybean cultivars were performed using iTRAQ-base quantitative.

On the basis of GO and pathway enrichment analysis, we concluded that the &#x0201c;photosynthesis was most significantly enriched. KEGG and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins showed that electron carrier activity proteins were significantly enriched in the photosynthesis pathway (P = 4.18E-4 for differentially expressed proteins of four-/two- weeks old leaves, P = 5.45E-6 for diff-expressed proteins of six/two weeks old leaves).
