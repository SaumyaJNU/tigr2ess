To date, it is the only method of simultaneously measuring multiple key electrophysiological parameters, such as transmembrane voltage and intracellular free calcium, at high spatial and temporal resolution. Despite the impact it has already had on the fields of cardiac arrhythmias and whole-heart computational modeling, present-day system designs precludes its adoption by the broader cardiovascular research community because of their high costs. Taking advantage of recent technological advances, we developed and validated low-cost optical mapping systems for panoramic imaging using Langendorff-perfused pig hearts, a clinically-relevant model in basic research and bioengineering. By significantly lowering financial thresholds, this powerful cardiac electrophysiology imaging modality may gain wider use in research and, even, teaching laboratories, which we substantiated using the lower-cost Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart model.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Optical mapping is a high-speed fluorescence imaging method that uses fluorescent dyes to measure cardiac and neuronal electrophysiological parameters such as transmembrane voltage, intracellular free calcium and cell-to-cell communication. In the cardiac electrophysiology field, this method has enabled researchers to study properties of both healthy and diseased heart tissue at high spatial and temporal resolution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Coupled with the use of drugs to perturb component cell and tissue activity, this method has helped provide mechanistic insights into how life-threatening arrhythmias arise and how they are sustained. Furthermore, whole-heart computer modeling and simulation studies may also be validated with optical mapping data, leading to the design and development of rational antiarrhythmic therapies <italic>in silico</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>A critical limitation of using optical mapping to study fibrillation on the epicardial surface of a Langendorff-perfused heart is that a camera can only take 2D images from one point-of-view. If one wants to detect ventricular ectopic beats or track spiral waves out of the one field-of-view afforded by a single camera, a panoramic optical mapping system is needed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Panoramic imaging systems either use multiple cameras, mirrors, or both to simultaneously image the globe-shaped heart from multiple points-of-view. System configurations providing from two to four points-of-view have been developed by several groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Two points-of-view allows one to image the anterior (front) and posterior (back) of the heart while four points-of-view yields overlapping fields-of-view and more complete spatial information. All such systems have enabled the visualization and quantitative analysis of complex arrhythmias.</p><p>Despite its impact on the field of cardiac arrhythmias, panoramic optical mapping continues to be a prohibitively expensive procedure, limiting its widespread use. Currently, the highest cost components are the high-speed fluorescence imaging cameras. Considering that the cost of the cameras most commonly used in the field is ~$40,000 USD each, constructing a panoramic imaging system utilizing four cameras may put the use of this powerful method out of reach to many research programs standing to gain from it. Add to this the cost of the optics, light sources, computer, electronics, mechanical and optomechanical components, it is easy to conceive of the total system cost rising above ~$180,000 USD.</p><p>The cameras used for optical mapping must meet certain minimum requirements to generate data of sufficient quality. Using standard fluorescent dyes, the photodetectors of the camera should be capable of recording action potentials and calcium transients with adequately high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) under nonfibrillatory and fibrillatory rhythms. Furthermore, these recordings must be achieved at minimal spatial and temporal resolution to capture propagation of the activation front and to describe wave patterns. For pig hearts, studies have shown negligible signal content above 100&#x02009;Hz in the temporal domain and below 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3&#x02009;mm in the spatial domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Hence, a camera with a frame-rate/sampling-frequency of at least 200&#x02009;Hz and resolution of at least 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50 pixels will surpass these minimal resolution limits (conservatively assuming heart dimensions of 15&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;15&#x02009;cm). If the goal of the imaging system is to capture all spatiotemporal phenomena on the epicardial surface of the heart, then the camera must be able to detect the highest frequency events at the requisite spatial resolution. Among the common animal models used for obtaining translational cardiac electrophysiology data (ex. rabbits and pigs), ventricular fibrillation in the rabbit heart represents the highest frequency events, reaching as high as ~30&#x02009;Hz<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Although a minimum sampling frequency of ~60&#x02009;Hz is needed, a sampling frequency of at least 300&#x02009;Hz will preserve the general morphology of action potentials and calcium transients.</p><p>In this study, we describe three optical mapping systems built around a collection of four Wide-VGA USB3.0 CMOS cameras (~$600 USD each at the time of writing) and one 2.2 Megapixel USB3.0 CMOS camera (~$1200 USD at the time of writing). Although the imaging systems described here were mainly validated with pig hearts, the systems were designed to be used with animal models ranging in size from the adult rabbit to the adult pig (or human). The most costly system described here is a four-camera optical mapping system providing four overlapping fields-of-view<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The total cost of this system, including all the optics, light sources, custom-built computer, electronics, mechanical and optomechanical components, was less than the ~$40,000 USD typically spent for one standard optical mapping camera system. Although some applications will certainly require such high-performance cameras, the systems described here represent inexpensive alternatives capable of yielding data of sufficient quality for arrhythmia research.</p><p>We now present the design and validation of three optical mapping systems. The first system uses four cameras to image the transmembrane voltage from the entire epicardial surface of the heart from four equally-spaced points-of-view. The second system uses four cameras to simultaneously image transmembrane voltage and intracellular free calcium from the anterior (two cameras) and posterior (two cameras) surface of the heart. Lastly, the third system uses just one high spatial resolution camera and multiple mirrors to image transmembrane voltage from the anterior and posterior surface of the heart. Besides meeting the minimal signal quality and spatiotemporal resolution requirements, we designed the imaging systems to be capable of making continuous long-duration recordings, which is not a common feature of panoramic optical mapping systems but has been proven to be important in the study of ventricular fibrillation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In terms of illumination, we built all light-sources around modern high-power light-emitting-diodes (LEDs), driving costs down further<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Besides the custom-machined mechanical components, all other components used are readily obtainable off-the-shelf (see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>).</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Optical Mapping System 1</title><p>The system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> utilizes four high-speed Wide-VGA USB3.0 CMOS cameras spaced 90&#x000b0; around the isolated heart on the horizontal plane, providing a 360&#x000b0; view of the heart ventricles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Although not implemented here, a surface scanner can be used to generate a 3D surface reconstruction of the epicardial surface, enabling the fluorescence signals collected from the four cameras to be mapped onto a geometric model of the heart surface. Each camera (CAM 1 &#x02013; CAM 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) is configured to record 120&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;160 superpixels (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 binning mode; 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 pixels per superpixel) at 400 frames-per-second (fps). All cameras are controlled by a single custom-built computer via USB3.0 interfaces. The frame exposure start signal generated by each camera allows one to record when each camera captures a frame. Although each camera is triggered to start at the same time, the inherent variation between camera hardware clocks can lead to slight timing differences between cameras over long duration recordings. The recorded sequence of frame exposure start signals from each camera allows one to deal with any such drifts during post-processing of the image sequences. We found the drift of a few milliseconds over tens of seconds of recording to be negligible relative to the electrophysiological phenomena observed in this study.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, two LED light sources are mounted on the left and right side of each camera. The LEDs are mounted to heat sinks and the emitted light lensed and filtered to provide illumination on all imaged surfaces of the dye-loaded heart. The off-the-shelf potentiometric dye di-4-ANEPPS was used because of its popularity, ease of loading, brightness and large fractional fluorescence change during cardiac action potentials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a&#x02013;d</xref> shows sample raw data, unfiltered in time. The heart was imaged while being electrically paced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>) and during ventricular fibrillation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). The SNR was sufficient for quantitative analysis for at least one hour of experimentation. For example, during pacing, the SNRs for CAM 1, CAM 2, CAM 3 and CAM 4 were ~49, ~52, ~50, and ~46, respectively. These sample values were calculated using the signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;d</xref> and the formula SNR&#x02009;=&#x02009;(AP Amplitude)/(SD during diastolic intervals), where AP: action potential and SD: standard deviation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2e</xref> shows a normalized transmembrane voltage fluorescence intensity maps at one time point during ventricular fibrillation, illustrating irregular electrical activity.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> presents samples of long-duration recordings that were taken simultaneously from all four cameras. In the 30&#x02009;second segments shown, the heart was paced at increasing frequency in an attempt to induce ventricular fibrillation (at ~22&#x02009;seconds, we stopped pacing). In this particular experiment, we failed to induce fibrillation and the heart returned to sinus rhythm. Although most of the proof-of-principle recordings in this study were 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;seconds in duration, we have tested the system&#x02019;s recording capability out to a minimum of 60&#x02009;seconds.</p><p>Although a frame rate of 400 fps is more than adequate to capture the highest frequency components of the action potential signal in the pig epicardium, some applications may require more temporal resolution. As a demonstration, we replaced one of the Wide-VGA USB3.0 CMOS cameras with the 2.2 Megapixel USB3.0 CMOS camera used in <bold>Optical Mapping System 3</bold> (described later). This more expensive camera provides higher spatial and temporal resolution while maintaining similarly sized pixels. Configuring the camera to record 160&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;220 superpixels (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 binning mode; 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 pixels per superpixel), a frame rate of 1000 fps can be achieved. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 3</xref>, the SNR remains sufficient at significantly higher frame rates (SNR ~35 for the action potentials shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> shows a time series of normalized transmembrane voltage fluorescence intensity maps during point electrical pacing (400&#x02009;ms cycle length).

Four frames from a 25&#x02009;ms interval are shown just after stimulation, illustrating the propagation of the activation front from the stimulation site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Point electrical stimulation was performed to emphasize the need for panoramic imaging when trying to detect events not visible from only one point-of-view.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Optical Mapping System 2</title><p>In cardiac electrophysiology, transmembrane voltage and intracellular free calcium are two of the most important parameters of interest because of their joint roles in excitation-contraction coupling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. As such, the simultaneous measurement of both parameters has become the gold standard in optical mapping. The system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> uses the same four high-speed Wide-VGA USB3.0 CMOS cameras to simultaneously image transmembrane voltage and intracellular free calcium from the anterior and posterior surface of the heart. For both points-of-view, one camera images action potentials while another images calcium transients. Each camera (CAM 1 &#x02013; CAM 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) is configured to record 120&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;160 superpixels (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 binning mode; 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 pixels per superpixel) at 400 fps.</p><p>We used RH237 and rhod-2AM to measure transmembrane voltage and intracellular free calcium, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. These off-the-shelf dyes are widely used in combination by the optical mapping community and have the benefit of being excitable by the same light source.

The heart was imaged during electrical pacing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Video 4</xref>) at a cycle length of 500&#x02009;ms. Compared to di-4-ANEPPS, we found RH237 and rhod-2AM challenging to load in the pig heart, emphasizing the need to optimize dye-loading protocols for each dye and species. The SNRs for CAM 1, CAM 2, CAM 3 and CAM 4 were ~24 (voltage), ~34 (calcium), ~26 (voltage), and ~43 (calcium), respectively, calculated using the signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>.</p><p>As a proof-of-principle application, we measured the effect of nifedipine on the action potential and calcium transient.

And with the advent of the high-speed USB3.0 interface, it is possible to continuously record image sequences from cameras directly to the computer&#x02019;s solid-state drives. The system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> takes advantage of the progress in spatial resolution by performing multi-view optical mapping with a single camera. By using six mirrors, the system can image both the anterior and posterior surface of the heart using just one high resolution camera.

These systems used two mirrors placed at the back of the heart to show two reflected images of the posterior surface. This provided three views, spaced ~120&#x000b0; apart, with one direct view and two reflected. Because of the longer light path, reflected images of the heart were smaller. All three views were roughly in focus because of the small size of the hearts used and the large depth-of-focus of the camera lens. The much larger size of the pig hearts used in this study made challenging this implementation, which led us to the presented configuration, which provides two equal views of the anterior and posterior surface. Though less emission light is collected compared to the more direct view approaches of <bold>Optical Mapping Systems 1 and 2</bold>, sufficient signal quality can be achieved with such high-light Langendorff-perfused heart preparations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref> shows sample raw data, unfiltered in time.

During sinus rhythm, the SNR from points on the posterior (blue) and anterior (red) surface were ~78 and ~55, respectively, calculated using the action potentials shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A Validation Study in the Langendorff-Perfused Rabbit Heart</title><p>An extensive study using a large animal model may be too costly to pursue for many research groups and would certainly be too expensive to use in a biomedical engineering teaching laboratory, for which these systems were also designed for. Therefore, we tested the same CMOS cameras used in <bold>Optical Mapping Systems 1 and 2</bold> in the Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart. Using the uEye Cockpit software, each camera was configured to record 120&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;160 superpixels at 400 fps. For comparison, images were also taken with another camera typically used in optical mapping systems (Evolve 128 EMCCD camera; 128&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;128 pixels; Photometrics, AZ, USA).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9a,b</xref> shows sample raw data, unfiltered in time.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>, the SNRs for the single-pixel blue and red traces were ~14 and ~9, respectively, while the SNRs for the spatially-averaged (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 pixels) blue and red traces were ~40 and ~36, respectively. These sample values were calculated using the signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>. For comparison, the same heart was imaged with the EMCCD camera under the same conditions (frame rate&#x02009;=&#x02009;400 fps and same illumination intensity). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>, the SNRs for the single-pixel blue and red traces were ~23 and ~19, respectively, while the SNRs for the spatially-averaged (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 pixels) blue and red traces were ~59 and ~47, respectively. These sample values were calculated using the signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>. As expected, the EMCCD camera performed considerably better than the low-cost CMOS camera, and the difference in performance would be magnified in low-light level preparations like cardiac monolayers. However, for high-light level preparations, these modern low-cost CMOS cameras represent inexpensive alternatives capable of yielding data of sufficient quality. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref> shows sample raw data, again unfiltered in time, demonstrating the suitability of using these CMOS cameras for intracellular calcium imaging in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have described and tested three low-cost optical mapping systems capable of panoramic imaging in a translational heart model. Our most costly implementation has a total system cost less than that of one standard optical mapping camera system, making this method financially viable to more research groups. There are, however, certain limitations with our approach. First, the high-speed CMOS cameras used have lower light sensitivity and more noise compared with the cameras typically used by the optical mapping community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a,b</xref>). Thus, using these cameras in low-light level preparations like cardiac monolayers or tissue-engineered constructs may yield unacceptably low SNRs. But for isolated hearts from adult rabbits to adult pigs, we have demonstrated that these low-cost CMOS cameras produce sufficient SNRs to study arrhythmias and drug-action. Second, we used blebbistatin as an excitation-contraction uncoupler to minimize motion &#x02018;artifacts&#x02019; in our fluorescence signals. Though this is currently standard practice in the optical mapping field, recent studies have shown that this compound can have deleterious effects on cardiac tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Consequently, it would be desirable to develop a low-cost optical analog to the epicardial electrode sock, designed to record epicardial activity in a beating heart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Although the presented systems can be used as is, there is still room for improvement. First, dye loading optimization in large animal models, like the pig, is necessary to improve SNRs and to further reduce costs since larger hearts generally require more dye. The use of newly-developed potentiometric dyes will also improve SNRs because they have been shown to produce larger fractional changes in fluorescence during action potentials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Second, exploration of other low-cost high-speed cameras is essential as the development of digital industrial cameras has been progressing at a rapid pace. We utilized CMOS cameras made by IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH because of their cost, performance and programming interface. We are currently exploring newer, and in some cases lower-cost, cameras from the same manufacturer and other manufacturers like Allied Vision Technologies GmbH and Basler AG.</p><p>Studying cardiac arrhythmias in animal models has been essential to furthering our understanding of this complex biological phenomenon. However, small animal models like the mouse do not represent a clinically-relevant model for studying either ventricular or atrial fibrillation, especially if the study of arrhythmia dynamics in isolated hearts is complemented with the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype. The use of animal models like the goat, sheep or pig permit researchers to obtain <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes of arrhythmias similar to those observed in the clinical setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Experiments in such models substantially increase the cost of both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. As such, low-cost implementations of powerful experimental methods like panoramic optical mapping will help enable more extensive <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies in large mammals with complex arrhythmias, a capacity limited to few laboratories. Importantly, the panoramic mapping approach enables one to track rotors on the myocardial surface at a resolution not achievable in current clinical electrophysiology procedures, which are limited to simultaneous multipolar recordings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>By lowering the financial threshold for implementing panoramic optical mapping, building a system that combines panoramic optical mapping with electrical mapping may be feasible while maintaining cost containment. For instance, simultaneous panoramic imaging and endocardial mapping using a balloon electrode array would provide both epicardial and endocardial information, respectively, which are both relevant in the study of ventricular arrhythmias<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Furthermore, doing both of these measurements in a torso-tank fitted with hundreds of body-surface electrodes would simultaneously provide a complete set of electrocardiogram information on the pseudo-torso surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. ECG imaging based on body surface potentials allows clinicians to non-invasively infer the electrical activity in the heart by solving an &#x0201c;inverse problem.&#x0201d; Though much progress has been made in reconstructing cardiac electrical activity from these remote electrode measurements, validating these inferences with combined panoramic optical mapping and endocardial mapping should prove useful. Finally, parallel work in the field of whole-heart computational modeling will undoubtedly benefit from such multi-modal validation measurements, leading to a more coherent picture of complex arrhythmias and therapeutic interventions to restore sinus rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Computer System</title><p>We built a custom computer to support all three optical mapping systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information</xref>).
