Previous studies have indicated that DCD plays key roles in the maintenance of the balance of dNTP pools, cell cycle progression, and plant development. However, few studies have elucidated the functions of the DCD gene in Panicoideae plants. <italic>Setaria</italic> has been proposed as an ideal model of Panicoideae grasses, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis research. Here, a <italic>Setaria italica</italic> stripe leaf mutant (<italic>sistl2</italic>) was isolated from EMS-induced lines of &#x0201c;Yugu1,&#x0201d; the wild-type parent. The <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant exhibited semi-dwarf, striped leaves, abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure, and delayed cell cycle progression compared with Yugu1. High-throughput sequencing and map-based cloning identified the causal gene <italic>SiSTL2</italic>, which encodes a DCD protein. The occurrence of a single-base G to A substitution in the fifth intron introduced alternative splicing, which led to the early termination of translation. Further physiological and transcriptomic investigation indicated that <italic>SiSTL2</italic> plays an essential role in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis, cell cycle, and DNA replication, which suggested that the gene has conserved functions in both foxtail millet and rice. Remarkably, in contrast to DCD mutants in C<sub>3</sub> rice, <italic>sistl2</italic> showed a significant reduction in leaf cell size and affected C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic capacity in foxtail millet. qPCR showed that <italic>SiSTL2</italic> had a similar expression pattern to typical C<sub>4</sub> genes in response to a low CO<sub>2</sub> environment. Moreover, the loss of function of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> resulted in a reduction of leaf <sup>13</sup>C content and the enrichment of DEGs in photosynthetic carbon fixation. Our research provides in-depth knowledge of the role of DCD in the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis model <italic>S. italica</italic> and proposed new directions for further study of the function of DCD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dCMP deaminase</kwd><kwd>chloroplast biogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>cell expansion</kwd><kwd>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Setaria italica</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase (DCD) is a key enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) synthesis pathway. DCD catalyzes the deamination of deoxycytidylate (dCMP) to produce deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), the latter of which is the substrate that ultimately forms dTTP (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Ellims et al., 1981</xref>). As described in previous studies, DCD contains two conserved motifs, HXE and PCXXC, which reportedly function as a zinc-binding motif (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Weiner et al., 1993</xref>). The DCD monomer is characterized to have between four and five &#x003b1;-helixes and six &#x003b2;-sheets, which are arranged in an &#x003b1;-&#x003b2;-&#x003b1; sandwich (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Scortecci et al., 2017</xref>). Six DCD monomers combine to form a biologically active homohexamer in bacteria and animals (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2008</xref>). As an allosteric enzyme, DCD contains an allosteric site. dTTP and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) are the inhibitor and activator of DCD, respectively, which competitively bind to the allosteric site to control protein stability and further regulate the activity of DCD (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Marx and Alian, 2015</xref>). This allosteric regulation depends on the participation of divalent metal ions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Scortecci et al., 2017</xref>). The pools of dTTP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are basic elements essential for DNA synthesis, replication, recombination, and repair (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>), which further guarantee the normal procession of these biological pathways. Two enzymes, the abovementioned DCD and ribonucleoside reductase (RNR), are mostly responsible for the maintenance of sufficient dTTP (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2005</xref>). RNR, which catalyzes the reduction reaction to produce deoxy-ribonucleotide diphosphate (dNDPs), is responsible for the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of four dNTPs to ensure the dNTP pools balance (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Buckland et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to the <italic>de novo</italic> pathway, dTTP can be supplemented by the thymidine kinase (TK) salvage pathway in a majority of higher eukaryotes. TK, as the key enzyme in the salvage pathway, can catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxidized thymidine to form deoxythymidine monophosphate, the substrate to produce dTTP (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Leija et al., 2016</xref>). When either of the <italic>de novo</italic> or salvage pathway is defective, the other can compensate for the loss of pyrimidine synthesis function (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Leija et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, these pathways are mutually interrelated to maintain sufficient dTTP and the balance of the dNTP pools. In addition, the biosynthesis of dTTP is a highly coordinated process.</p><p>Deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase defects always lead to the imbalance of the dNTP pools and further cause the abnormal synthesis of DNA. In the process of DNA synthesis, the accuracy of DNA polymerase depends on the supply of dNTPs (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Buckland et al., 2014</xref>). When the correct dNTP inserts into a nucleotide chain, it competes with three other kinds of dNTPs. In addition, the fidelity of DNA replication also depends on the GC% in the dNTP pools. Thus, unbalanced dNTP pools increase the probability of the insertion of the wrong base (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Gu and Li, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gawel et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, unbalanced dNTP pools can increase the frequencies of insertion/deletion mutations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). It has been reported that in fission yeast, the deletion of <italic>DCD1</italic> leads to drastic changes in the accumulations of dCTP and dTTP. The mutant strain becomes sensitive to DNA damage inducers, has a decreased capacity for DNA replication and repair, even appears the collapse of replication folk (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies also reported that in budding yeast, <italic>DCD</italic> or <italic>RNR</italic> mutation could increase the mutation rates, slow down the DNA replication, and impact the genome integrity and stability (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kohalmi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). In rice, the mutation of <italic>OsDCD</italic> results in DNA damage and leaf cell apoptosis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, DCD decrease sometimes impaired cell cycle progression. The S-phase is the period in which the majority of DNA replication is established. Thus, the adequacy of dNTPs is a precondition of entrance into S-phase (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al., 1986</xref>). Insufficient dNTPs or the imbalance of dNTP pools can activate the S-phase checkpoint, delay the progress of the cell cycle, decrease the cell proliferation rate, and even lead to cell apoptosis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have established that DCD or RNR deficiency in yeast resulted in cell cycle arrest in the S-phase (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Elledge and Davis, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>). The deficits of DCD in rice also cause cell cycle progression defects (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). DCD and other dNTPs biosynthetic genes are coordinated with cell cycle progression. Some cell cycle associated enzymes participate in the regulation of nucleotide metabolizing genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the activities of most dTTP synthetic enzymes exhibit periodic fluctuations during the cell cycle (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al., 1986</xref>). TK and thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are the targets of the cell cycle proteasome APC/C and can be degraded by APC/C during the G1-phase to maintain the balance of the dNTP pools in mammals (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2005</xref>). E2Fs, as important cell cycle associated transcription factors (TFs), can induce specific <italic>RNR1a</italic> expression in the G1/S-phase (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lincker et al., 2004</xref>). However, <italic>DCD1</italic> is reported to have a periodic expression level during the cell cycle in HeLa cells, but is transcribed at a constant level in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>In higher plants, mutations of dNTPs synthesis genes always result in abnormal leaf development. For example, the phenotype of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana RNR1</italic> mutant has crinkled leaves with white pits. The mutant has fewer, larger, and dysplastic chloroplasts (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Garton et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, mutations in large and small submits of RNR in rice lead to dwarf plants, white stripe leaves, low chlorophyll contents, and undeveloped chloroplasts (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). There are few reports on DCD gene functions in higher plants. A previous study showed that rice <italic>OsDCD</italic> mutant <italic>st2</italic> has white stripe leaves and reduced plant height. The chloroplast development and chlorophyll accumulation of <italic>st2</italic> are defected (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). In a recent study, another rice <italic>DCD</italic> mutant, <italic>alr</italic>, showed similar, but more severe phenotypes compared with <italic>st2</italic>, which had a small grain size and necrotic spots on the leaves. In addition, the cells of the <italic>alr</italic> mutant were increased in size, but decreased in number (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have proposed several explanations for these phenotypes in the <italic>OsDCD</italic> mutant. First, the unbalanced dNTP pools impaired the plastid genome replication and delayed chloroplast development. Second, the cell cycle progression and cell division were influenced, which resulted in small organs and dwarf plants (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we isolated an <italic>Setaria italica</italic> mutant <italic>sistl2</italic> from EMS-induced lines of the Yugu1 cultivar. The mutant gene <italic>SiSTL2</italic> encodes a DCD protein. <italic>sistl2</italic> has similar phenotypes to those of <italic>alr</italic> and <italic>st2</italic> in rice. More interestingly, we found that <italic>sistl2</italic> was different to the rice <italic>alr</italic> mutant, including significantly reduced leaf cell size, normal second and third leaves, and uninfluenced grain size. It is worth noting that the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic character of <italic>sistl2</italic> was affected, which has not been previously reported. In our study, we analyzed the mutant phenotypes, the expression of the causal genes, and expounded the function of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> in <italic>S. italica</italic>. Our research provides further insights into the role of DCD in the C<sub>4</sub> model <italic>S. italica</italic> and proposed new perspectives for further study of DCD functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Growth Condition</title><p>The <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant was obtained from the EMS-induced <italic>S. italica</italic> cultivar Yugu1.

Then, we verified the interactions between the EBS element and the SiE2F proteins by using the yeast one-hybrid assay (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>). The results showed that <italic>Seita.4G108100</italic> and <italic>Seita.1G314900</italic>, which are homologs of E2Fe, could bind to the EBS of the <italic>SiSTL2</italic> promoter and activate the expression of the <italic>Aureobasidin A</italic> (AbA) resistance gene in yeast strains. E2F family members are TFs that are closely related to the regulation of cell cycle progression. Collectively, these results suggested that <italic>SiSTL2</italic> may be regulated by cell cycle-related E2Fe and impacted cell cycle progression.

Most of the DEGs in photosynthesis-associated pathways and chlorophyll metabolism were down-regulated, which was consistent with the decreased capacity of photosynthesis and chlorophyll content of <italic>sistl2</italic>. Almost all of the DEGs in nucleotide metabolism, DNA replication and mismatch repair pathways were up-regulated; this may be caused by feedback regulation of the SiSTL2 functional defect. DEGs in carbon metabolism and glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism generally were down-regulated, indicating that energy conversion may be impaired in <italic>sistl2</italic>. DEGs in hormone signal pathways showed great changes, especially several auxin and cytokinin response regulator genes were sharply up-regulated (<italic>SiIAA26</italic>, 1.80 fold; <italic>SiLAX2</italic>, 1.74 fold; <italic>SiARR12</italic>, 2.14 fold; <italic>SiARF5</italic>, 2.31 fold; <italic>SiDFL1</italic>, 5.50 fold; <italic>SiARR9</italic>, 1.99 fold; <italic>SiTGA9</italic>, 2.58 fold). This suggested that hormone regulators that promote growth respond positively to the development of plant retardation. Most DEGs that participate in cell cycle regulation were up-regulated, which was consistent with the results of flow cytometric analysis and the yeast one-hybrid assay.</p><p>The expression changes of some associated TFs are summarized in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11">S8</xref></bold>. It is noteworthy that some TFs families are generally up-regulated, such as Teosinte Branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating Cell Factor (TCP), E2F, Growth Regulating Factor (GRF), YABBY, and Auxin Response Factor (ARF). Among these TFs families, ARF, E2F, and GRF control the leaf growth and development by regulating cell proliferation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Horiguchi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Magyar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Guilfoyle and Hagen, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2010</xref>). TCP family members are responsible for the progress of leaf expansion and development (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Trillo and Cubas, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Efroni et al., 2013</xref>). YABBY can regulate the leaf axial development (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sarojam et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, some members of ARF and GRF are speculated to be associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in maize (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). However, some other TFs families also may be associated with leaf patterning, plastid biogenesis, and photomorphogenesis, such as MYB, GLK, bHLH, GRAS, and GATA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). These TFs are also speculated to participate in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang P. et al., 2017</xref>). Members of these TFs families are numerous. In <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant, many members of these TFs up-regulated or down-regulated sharply compared with that in WT. This indicates that the expression of these TFs are influenced in the mutant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref></bold>). Collectively, the leaf development and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be impaired because of the mutation of <italic>SiSTL2</italic>. In addition, to validate the RNA-seq, 13 genes were selected and detected by qRT-PCR (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>). These genes are associated with photosynthesis, DNA replication, and cell cycle, encoding PS I/II reaction center proteins (Seita.J018400, Seita.3G149000, Seita.3G184900, and Seita.6G032200), chlorophyll binding protein (Seita.6G158500), DNA polymerase subunits (Seita.6G050100 and Seita.5G394500), DNA replication licensing factor (Seita.1G352100), cycle division control proteins (Seita.4G045900 and Seita.2G283000), and cyclins (Seita.9G171000, Seita.5G005800, and Seita.5G352700). The consequences are correspond to that in RNA-seq.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SiSTL2</italic> Affects C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis Capacity in Foxtail Millet</title><p>To investigate the influence of SiSTL2 on the capacity for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, the photosynthetic index, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters, and chlorophyll (Chl) accumulation were detected in <italic>sistl2</italic>. The results showed that compared with Yugu1, the net photosynthetic rate of <italic>sistl2</italic> was decreased by 46.1%; the stomata conductance was decreased by 45.6%; the transpiration rate declined by 65.2%, whereas the intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration showed no significant difference compared with that in Yugu1, concurrently. This suggested that the photosynthetic capacity of <italic>sistl2</italic> was impaired, which led to the accumulation of intercellular CO<sub>2</sub>. The &#x003a6;PSII reflects the light absorbed by PS II that is used in photochemical reactions. Fv&#x02032;/Fm&#x02032; indicates the excitation energy capture efficiency, which is also reflective of the light portion used in photochemistry.

The results of RNA-seq also suggested that the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis of <italic>sistl2</italic> may be affected. To confirm this, the stable carbon isotopes of the <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant, Yugu1, and a rice <italic>Japonica cultivar</italic>, as a C<sub>3</sub> control, were measured. The atmosphere contains a small amount of <sup>13</sup>C. When C<sub>3</sub> plants fix CO<sub>2</sub>, Rubisco prefers <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation enzyme PEPC does not tend to function on <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>. Rubisco of C<sub>4</sub> plants only exists in BSCs which segregates rubisco from air. As a result, <sup>13</sup>C accumulates to a greater extent in C<sub>4</sub> plants than in C<sub>3</sub> plants. It has been reported that C<sub>3</sub> plants and C<sub>4</sub> plants can be identified by the value of &#x00394;<sup>13</sup>C aaa (C<sub>3</sub>: -32 to -23aaa; C<sub>4</sub>: -19 to -6aaa) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bender, 1971</xref>). Our data show that&#x00394;<sup>13</sup>Caaa in <italic>sistl2</italic> was significantly decreased by 4.87% (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref></bold>), although the value was still within the range of C<sub>4</sub>. Then, we tested the expression of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> and certain C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis-related genes that respond to the stress of low CO<sub>2</sub> environments. The results showed that in Yugu1, the expression level of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> was rapidly up-regulated until 12 h, decreased to the initial level, and remained stable. However, in <italic>sistl2</italic>, the transcription level remained at a low level until 24 h and started to increase after 36 h (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref></bold>). This suggested that the expression of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> can respond in a timely manner to the low CO<sub>2</sub> level. The mutation in <italic>SiSTL2</italic> resulted in a delayed response to the stress of a low CO<sub>2</sub> environment. The C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis-related genes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) showed a similar expression pattern to <italic>SiSTL2</italic> in low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, which increased to a peak value at 12 h and then returned to the initial level (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref></bold>). In conclusion, we speculated that <italic>SiSTL2</italic> might indirectly regulated C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p><p>To further verify the connection between <italic>SiSTL2</italic> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, transcript levels of 102 previously reported <italic>S. italica</italic> C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>) in WT and <italic>sistl2</italic> are summarized from our RNA-seq data (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S10</xref></bold>). According to the expression patterns differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, these genes are divided into three types. Type I including genes that have higher expression levels in C<sub>4</sub> leaves compared with C<sub>3</sub> leaves. Type II genes show different expression patterns between C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> species. Type III genes have orthologs in C<sub>4</sub> species but absent in C<sub>3</sub> species (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). Comparison result showed that most of these genes (89 of 102; Type I, 18 of 20; Type II, 59 of 65; Type III, 12 of 17) also changed their expression patterns in <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S10</xref></bold>). Moreover, expression of 25.5% of these genes decreased more than twofolds in <italic>sistl2</italic> compared with WT. According to the previous study (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>), C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes which are associated with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in leaves and C<sub>4</sub> evolution are also summarized, respectively (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>, right panel and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">S10</xref></bold>). The result showed that 87.8% C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis associated genes (43 of 49) and 86.0% C<sub>4</sub> evolution associated genes (37 of 43) are down-regulated in <italic>sistl2</italic>. These results further indicated that the mutant in <italic>SiSTL2</italic> has some linkage with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Comparison of DCD Mutant Characteristics in Foxtail Millet and Rice</title><p>In <italic>sistl2</italic>, the plant height and chlorophyll contents were significantly decreased, the leaves have white stripes (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Furthermore, some leaf cells in <italic>sistl2</italic> contain fewer chloroplasts or even have no chloroplast (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). All these phenotypes were quite similar to the mutants of <italic>OsDCD</italic> (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). This suggested that the function of SiSTL2 is similar to that of OsDCD. What&#x02019;s more, similar phenotypes also exist in the mutants of other dNTP synthesis associated genes and other species (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). Thus we speculate that there are some correlations between dNTPs synthesis and leaf/chloroplast development, which need more experiments and evidences to prove it. In our study, the cell cycle progression of <italic>sistl2</italic> was impaired (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref></bold>), DEGs were enriched in the cell cycle GO term (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref></bold>) and most of the cell cycle-associated genes were up-regulated (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref></bold>). In the <italic>alr</italic> mutant, the cell cycle progression was also delayed (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). This indicated that SiSTL2 played a similar role in cell cycle regulation to OsDCD. In addition, the dNTP pools in <italic>alr</italic> were unbalanced. This caused further defects in DNA replication and repair (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). Our results show that SiSTL2 also has deamination activity similar with OsDCD (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>). In <italic>sistl2</italic>, the results of RNA-seq showed that abundant DEGs were enriched in the DNA replication and mismatch repair pathways (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>). In addition, most DEGs associated with nucleotide metabolism, DNA replication, and mismatch repair were up-regulated, which may be caused by feedback control (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref></bold>). These results suggested that similar to OsDCD, SiSTL2 can regulate DNA replication and reparation. In addition, the expression levels of chloroplast development-associated genes in <italic>sistl2</italic> were significantly decreased relative to Yugu1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>). The same results were also obtained in <italic>alr</italic> mutant (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that SiSTL2 disruption can impair chloroplast development. In summary, SiSTL2 has a similar function to OsDCD, and has effects on DNA replication and reparation, cell cycle progression, and chloroplast development.</p></sec><sec><title>SiSTL2 Participates in the Regulation of Cell Division and Influences Cell Expansion</title><p>The leaves of the <italic>sistl2</italic> mutant were significantly smaller than that of Yugu1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S4</xref></bold>).

These two parameters always depend on cell proliferation and cell expansion.</p><p>In our study, the ratios of 4C and 8C cells are significantly lower in <italic>sistl2</italic> compared with the level in Yugu1 (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref></bold>). We also found that in the vasculature of <italic>sistl2</italic>, the number of MCs and BSCs was reduced (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref></bold>). This indicated that the cell cycle progression in <italic>sistl2</italic> was delayed and that the cell proliferation may be defective. RNA-seq also showed that cell cycle-related genes (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref></bold>) and TFs (E2F; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>) suggesting that cell cycle of <italic>sistl2</italic> is influenced. Some reports indicated that many dNTP synthesis-associated genes were controlled by cell cycle regulating proteins (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2005</xref>). RNR, as an upstream gene of DCD and the S-phase check point, can active the cell cycle going into S-phase under the control of cell cycle regulating transcription factor E2F5 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lincker et al., 2004</xref>). The promoter of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> also has binding sites of SiE2Fe (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref></bold>). Thus, we speculated that SiSTL2, similar to RNR, maybe be correlated with cell cycle regulation. However, SiE2Fe is predicted to have the opposite function relative to E2F5 in cell cycle regulation. Therefore, the role of SiSTL2 in the cell cycle required further exploration.</p><p>However, the leaf cell sizes of both BSCs and MCs in <italic>sistl2</italic> were also significantly decreased (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F,G</xref></bold>), which indicated that the cell expansion of <italic>sistl2</italic> was also impacted. The RNA-seq data showed that TFs associated with cell expansion, such as TCP and GRF (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Trillo and Cubas, 2010</xref>), were up-regulated. This suggested that the mutation in SiSTL2 also impaired cell expansion. In addition, <italic>sistl2</italic> the decreases in cell sizes (by 43.52% in BSCs and 40.27% in MCs) were as strong as those in leaf length (44.1% reduction) and leaf width (58.8% reduction) relative to Yugu1 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S4</xref></bold>). However, the cell cycle progression changes were not so strong (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>). Therefore, we surmised that SiSTL2 may participate in cell cycle regulation and influence the cell expansion. In <italic>sistl2</italic>, the smaller leaf size was mainly caused by defective cell expansion, with reduced cell proliferation a subordinate reason for the smaller leaf size.</p></sec><sec><title>SiSTL2 May Have an Impact on C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis</title><p>Chloroplast development is important for photosynthesis, and the Kranz leaf structure is a characteristic and precondition of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. In <italic>sistl2</italic>, some BSCs and MCs have fewer or even no chloroplasts (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>) and the expression of chloroplast development genes are also decreased (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref></bold>). This suggested that the mutation in <italic>SiSTL2</italic> may affect the chloroplast development at transcription level. Considering that the chloroplast genes transcription depend on both nucleus-encoded RNA polymerase and plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, we speculate that the defect of SiSTL2 may have some influence on the nucleus or plastid transcription system. Additionally, <italic>sistl2</italic> displayed some abnormal phenotypes with respect to Kranz structure, such as undeveloped veins, reduced BSCs and decreased mesophyll cell number between vascular bundles (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). This may be the result of the restraints in both cell expansion and cell division. However, many members of the TFs families that regulate leaf development and leaf cell differentiation, such as YABBY, bHLH, GRAS, and GATA (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Siegfried et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) are differently expressed in <italic>sistl2</italic>. These suggested that mutations in <italic>SiSTL2</italic> influenced the leaf development and leaf structure. Meanwhile, most genes in the carbon fixation pathways in photosynthetic organisms were down-regulated (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref></bold>); the expression of TFs may regulate C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (ARF, MYB, and GLK) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2015</xref>) changed extensively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref></bold>). And most of the C<sub>4</sub> candidate genes were down-regulated after <italic>SiSTL2</italic> was defected (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>). These suggest that there are some linkage between C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and the mutation of <italic>SiSTL2</italic>. The <sup>13</sup>C accumulation in <italic>sistl2</italic> was also significantly reduced (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref></bold>). This suggested that the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis of the mutant was affected. Moreover, under the stress of a low CO<sub>2</sub> environment, <italic>SiSTL2</italic> can respond to the up-regulation in the similar pattern compared with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis genes (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D,E</xref></bold>). Given that the regulation of dTTP synthesis by DCD is a relatively upstream biological pathway, we speculate that the effect of the <italic>SiSTL2</italic> mutation is global in plants, indirectly regulating the chloroplast development and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. As the decrease in chloroplast biogenesis, the abilities of both photosynthesis and carbon fixation were impaired seriously. In the conditions of low CO<sub>2</sub>, the mobilization of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis genes requires sufficient dNTPs to ensure that the expression levels of <italic>SiSTL2</italic> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis genes are subsequently altered.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XD conceived the project.
