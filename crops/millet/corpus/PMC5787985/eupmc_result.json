    "Miliary tuberculosis results from the lymphohematogenous spread of the tubercle bacilli to the vascular beds in the lungs and other organs. Diagnosis is made by clinical judgment and chest X-ray showing miliary mottling of the lung fields. Another imaging study like computed tomography imaging of the lungs and abdomen can also be supportive in diagnosing miliary tuberculosis. We present a case of miliary tuberculosis in an immunocompetent young male with atypical manifestation of a left-sided pleural effusion and a life-threatening complication of acute respiratory distress syndrome during hospital stay which required noninvasive mechanical ventilation and steroids therapy, along with antitubercular medication."
