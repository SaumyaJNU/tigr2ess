The planting area and output for jujube in China account for 95% of the world&#x02019;s planting area and output for this fruit. However, jujube shrunken-fruit disease (JSFD) is prevalent in jujube plantations in China [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This disease influences jujube yield and quality and results in total crop failure. Numerous studies have been conducted to prevent the shrunken fruit disease. Chemical control is the most common method applied to remedy this disease [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the repeated application of chemical pesticides throughout the growth period of jujube hardly improves the condition of the jujube plant but rather results in damages to ecological balance, high pesticide residue, and drug resistance of pathogens. Exploring a new environment-friendly and effective biological pesticide to reduce these negative effects is currently a research hotspot to decrease the use or even replace chemical pesticides. Endophytes are microorganisms in healthy plant tissues which do not evidently harm plants. These microorganisms could be isolated from plant tissues through surface sterilization. Endophytes possess high colonization ability in the host [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and provide beneficial effect to the host [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Many studies have proved that the endophyte metabolite could kill pests and bacterial activity [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, exploring and using strains with active substances against disease and pests in plant endophyte can be used as biological agents to prevent shrunken fruit disease of Chinese jujube. Existing studies on the selection of associated antagonistic bacteria have mainly focused on rhizosphere soil bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], jujube endophytic bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and jujube leaves [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Isolation of endophytic fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes from different parts of healthy jujube to select antagonistic bacteria against the pathogen of JSFD has not been reported previously.</p><p>In this experiment, endophytic fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes were isolated from different tissues of healthy jujube. Strains with inhibited pathogen activity of JSFD were selected by testing their nutrition competition, production of antibiotics, and inhibition of pathogenic spore germination. The colonization capacity of these endophytes on jujube trees was tested. Additionally, strain was identified through morphological observation, physiological and biochemical reaction, 16S rDNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. This study was performed to screen endophytic strains with antagonistic activities against the pathogen of JSFD, and lay a foundation for a potential effective biocontrol agent against JSFD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Samples included fresh branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of &#x0201c;Zhanhua Dongzao&#x0201d; jujube.

During the growth season of jujube, the bacterial suspension was coated to the jujube leaf surface using sterile cotton. The bacterial suspension treated with sterile water was used as the control group. Then, the strains were isolated from leaves every 5 days by the same method of endophyte isolation.

In this paper, 16S rDNA sequences of type strains of nine <italic>Bacillus</italic> families were chosen from the GenBank as the ingroup, and 16S rDNA sequence of <italic>Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris</italic> was used as the outgroup.

These strains included 37 fungi, 20 bacteria, and 24 actinomycetes strains. Among these strains, 14 endophyte strains with certain spatial and nutritional competition were screened. Two strains (St-zn-9 and St-zn-34) with strong inhibition effects were selected by filter paper method. The inhibition zones of St-zn-9 and St-zn-34 were 6.14 &#x000b1; 0.04 mm and 8.27 &#x000b1; 0.11 mm, respectively. Effects of fermentation products on spore germination of the causal agent of JSFD were tested by the hanging drop method. St-zn-34 could significantly inhibit spore germination. Therefore, St-zn-34 was screened as the biocontrol bacteria. St-zn-34 was identified as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> based on the morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical characteristics and analysis of 16S rDNA sequence.</p><p>The name of JSFD was confusion and the pathogen was controversial. However, many scholars have proved recently that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic> was the pathogen or one of the pathogens of JSFD [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic> was chosen as the target pathogen of biocontrol strain of jujube endophytes. Culturable endophytes were isolated from different organs of jujube trees by conventional method. However, this process may fail to identify some non-culturable strains and some strains that grow slowly in the traditional culture medium. Population distribution patterns gained from non-culture and culture method differed significantly. The selected biocontrol strain St-zn-34 was identified as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> and isolated from jujube leaves. Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] successfully isolated <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> from jujube fruits, indicating its universal distribution in jujube trees.</p><p>Two selected endophytes strains (St-zn-09 and St-zn-34) showed good spatial and nutritional competition and strong antibiotics production. In this study, St-zn-09 was preliminarily identified as <italic>Trichoderma</italic> according to colonial morphology. This strain influenced the spore germination of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic> but differed significantly from the conidium germination of the control group. Conidia always produce a vesicle before each germination process, similar to the finding of Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This process may be due to the fact that St-zn-09 could break spore cell walls of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic> and cause outburst of protoplasm, though St-zn-09 did not affect spore germination of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic>. St-zn-34 inhibited the conidium germination of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic>, which conforms to the finding of Gu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The transmission of pathogen of JSFD is determined by its spores, so the strong inhibiting effect of the fermentation products of St-zn-34 on spore germination will directly affect the transmission ability of pathogen in the field. The antibiotics ability of biological strains is an important evaluation index of biocontrol effect. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> can produce <italic>iturins</italic>, <italic>fengycins</italic>, <italic>mycosubtilins</italic>, and many antibiotic substances. The antibiotic substance produced by St-zn-34 fermentation has been proved to exhibit wide antibacterial spectra and stable convective heat transfer, conforming to the characteristics of bacterial inhibition and heat tolerance of lipopeptide antibiotics. The proteinase K could reduce its bacterial inhibition, which reflects that it had properties of protein. Therefore, proteinase K should be a bacterial-inhibiting protein substance [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the biocontrol agent had the weakness of poor control effect and short duration in field application, which was related to the weak colonization capacity of the biocontrol agent in the host plants. The strong colonization capacity of the endophyte in the host could effectively reduce the accumulation of pathogen, and thus control disease [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, studies on the colonization of St-zn-34 in jujube trees will provide a theoretical basis for the biocontrol of JSFD. The endophytes screened in this paper exhibited strong colonization capacity and can maintain a long time duration in jujube leaves, but whether the strain could be colonized in other parts of jujube trees or it could spread from jujube leaves to other parts of jujube trees need further studies.</p><p>The salt concentration was also an important factor for St-zn-34. St-zn-34 grew well on 3% NaCl but not in solution with over 5% NaCl. This result is not consistent with the finding by Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which might be related to the poor salt resistance of St-zn-34 as an endophyte. However, the main effect of an endophyte is to increase significantly the salt resistance of host after being colonized in plants [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> at low salt concentration could promote plant growth and would not significantly affect plant growth at high salt concentration [<xref rid="pone.0199466.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, the salt-stress physiology of this endophyte requires further investigation in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199466.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Streak culture of endophytic <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strain St-zn-34 on potato dextrose agar plate.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199466.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199466.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Confront co-culture of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strain St-zn-34 and <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> strain CN193, the pathogen of jujube shrunken-fruit disease.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199466.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199466.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Inhibition effects of fermentation filtrates of strain St-zn-34 on <italic>A</italic>.<italic>alternata</italic> strain CN193.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199466.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199466.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Microscopic observation of strain St-zn-34 under environment scanning electron microscope.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199466.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199466.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>16S rDNA gene sequence of strain St-zn-34.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199466.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (C2016204202) and the Science and Technology Project in Henan Province Department of Education (17A210006).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0199466.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>XL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>GY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>ZC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Aetiologic studies on fruit shrink of jujube</article-title>. <source>Acta Agriculturae Boreali-Sinica</source>. <year>1995</year>; <volume>10</volume>: <fpage>139</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>143</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199466.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>ZJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name>. <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name>. <article-title>Studies on occurrence of jujube-fruit shrink disease in Shaanxi province</article-title>. <source>Chinese Agricultural Science Bulletin</source>. <year>2008</year>; <volume>24</volume>: <fpage>384</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>387</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0199466.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>XB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>TF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>YF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name>. <article-title>Isolation and identification of the pathogens of jujube (<italic>Zizyphus jujuba</italic> cv.
