Pile-fermentation is the key process for the formation of the characteristic properties of primary dark tea, during which the microorganism plays an important role. In this study, the changes of major chemical compounds, enzyme activities, microbial diversity, and their correlations were explored during the pile-fermentation process. Our chemical and enzymatic analysis showed that the contents of the major compounds were decreased, while the activities of polyphenol oxidase, cellulase, and pectinase were increased during this process, except peroxidase activity that could not be generated from microbial communities in primary dark tea. The genera <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Uwebraunia</italic>, and <italic>Unclassified Pleosporales</italic> of fungus and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> of bacteria were predominant in the early stage of the process, but only <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> were still dominated in the late stage and maintained a relatively constant until the end of the process. The amino acid was identified as the important abiotic factor in shaping the microbial community structure of primary dark tea ecosystem. Network analysis revealed that the microbial taxa were grouped into five modules and seven keystone taxa were identified. Most of the dominant genera were mainly distributed into module III, which indicated that this module was important for the pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea. In addition, bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) analysis revealed that the fungi made more contributions to the formation of the characteristic properties of primary dark tea than bacteria during the pile-fermentation process. Furthermore, 10 microbial genera including <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Eurotium</italic>, <italic>Uwebraunia, Debaryomyces</italic>, <italic>Lophiostoma</italic>, <italic>Peltaster</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, <italic>Aurantimonas</italic>, and <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> were identified as core functional genera for the pile-fermentation of primary dark tea. This study provides useful information for improving our understanding on the formation mechanism of the characteristic properties of primary dark tea during the pile-fermentation process.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>primary dark tea</kwd><kwd>food fermentation</kwd><kwd>microbial community</kwd><kwd>biochemical components</kwd><kwd>Illumina MiSeq sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31471706</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">41671233</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004735</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">13JJ4067</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">2018JJ2181</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="59"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Dark tea is a unique kind of microbial fermented teas, which is native to many regions of China, including Hunan, Yunnan, and Hubei provinces (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The manufacturing process of dark tea can be divided into primary processing stage and reprocessing stage. During the primary processing stage, primary dark tea was produced and was mainly used as material for compressed dark tea, including Fu brick tea, Hei brick tea, Hua brick tea, and Qiangliang tea. The manufacturing process of primary dark tea covers the following steps, harvesting fresh tea leaves, fixing, rolling, pile-fermentation, and drying processes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In the above processes, the pile-fermentation, a kind of solid-state fermentation, is the key process in the production of primary dark tea. The pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea is characterized by the growth and succession of microbial communities, and the microorganism plays a key role in the formation of the characteristic properties of primary dark tea during the pile-fermentation process (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991a</xref>).</p><p>A comprehensive study of microbial community succession could help to understand that how the sensory quality of primary dark tea was formed during the pile-fermentation process. Some kinds of microbial genera, including <italic>Candida</italic> sp., <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, and <italic>Penicillium</italic> in fungal community and <italic>Non-spore bacteria</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and <italic>Coccus</italic> in bacterial community, were identified as the dominant microbial genera by the culture-dependent method during the pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wen and Liu, 1991</xref>). However, the culture-dependent method is of limited value for identifying the microbial communities due to the limitation of cultural media (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the culture-independent methods, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and high-throughput sequencing technology (i.e., Illumina MiSeq sequencing) that use direct analysis of the diversity of ribosomal RNA genes with no culture step (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Amann and Ludwig, 2000</xref>), were introduced for identifying the structure of microbial communities in compressed dark tea, such as Fu brick tea and Pu-erh tea (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The genera <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Blastobotrys</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> were the major microbial communities in Pu-erh tea (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), and <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>Eurotium</italic>, <italic>Beauveria</italic>, <italic>Debaryomyces</italic>, <italic>Pestalotiopsis</italic>, <italic>Pichia</italic>, <italic>Rhizomucor</italic>, and <italic>Verticillium</italic> were the dominant microbial communities in Fu brick tea by PCR-DGGE (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2011</xref>) and high-throughput sequencing technology (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>During the pile-fermentation process, some new transformation products were generated in tea leaves. Our previous study showed that the power of substance transformation in tea leaves were mainly derived from the microbial enzymes, which were secreted from the microorganism during the pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991a</xref>). These transformations resulted in the formation of the characteristic properties of primary dark tea. The microbial metabolism, which produce the secreted enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), cellulase (CEL), and pectinase (PEC), thereby providing the effective biochemical power to oxidation of catechins, decomposition of cellulose, and hydrolyses of pectin and proteins. The microbial enzymatic action played an important role in the formation of the characteristics of primary dark tea (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). During the pile-fermentation process, the total contents of polyphenol, catechin, and soluble carbohydrate were decreased, and the catechin composition varied irregularly (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991c</xref>). The content of total amino acid (AA) was decreased, especially theanine and glutamic acid were decreased significantly; by contrast, the content of indispensable AAs, such as lusine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine, were increased remarkably. And the levels of caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were not significantly variated (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991b</xref>).</p><p>The succession of microbial community in primary dark tea during pile-fermentation process results in a dynamic taste and aroma of primary dark tea. Variation of major chemical compounds and enzyme activities in fermented tea has been studied (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991b</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>). The culturable microorganisms have also been identified in primary dark tea during the pile-fermentation process (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wen and Liu, 1991</xref>). However, the associations among microbiota and chemical compounds or enzyme activities, and so far the core functional microbiota were not clarified in primary dark tea. Thus, the assembly and dynamics of microbial community were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing during the pile-fermentation of primary dark tea. The changes of major chemical compounds content and enzyme activity were also investigated during this process. Based on these results, the relationship between microbiota and chemical compounds or enzyme activities was investigated by bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS). Finally, the core functional microorganisms were identified by comparison of the comprehensive importance of microorganisms correlated with the formation of characteristic properties of primary dark tea. The knowledge provide a new insight for better understanding on the mechanism of pile-fermentation in primary dark tea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tea Leaf Samples and Process Characterization</title><p>Sampling of primary dark tea was carried out in Ba Jiao tea factory (Yiyang, Hunan province, China). The manufacturing process of primary dark tea was performed as described by DB43/T660-2011 with a little modification (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, mature tea leaves (one bud and three to six leaves) were plucked from medium and sprinkled with water then fixing at 280&#x02013;320&#x000b0;C. The fixing leaves rolled twice by machine. Then, the rolling leaves (about 930 kg) were piled 1.1 m high, with ambient temperature about 28&#x000b0;C and moisture content about 78% in pile-fermentation apparatus for 12 h. Auto drying machine was used for drying the fermentation leaves at 120&#x02013;130&#x000b0;C twice or drying in the sun. Fifteen samples were collected from three independent batches of primary dark tea at different time of pile-fermentation process: pile-fermentation 0-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-h stages.

Microbiota inhabiting in tea leaves is of great importance for the distinctive biochemical characteristics of primary dark tea. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first work to extensively investigate the structural differentiation of microbial communities by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and linked with the major chemical compounds or enzyme activity during pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea.</p><p>Our chemical and enzymatic analysis showed that all major chemical compounds content were decreased, while the activities of PPO, CEL, and PEC were increased during the pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea, except POD. Previous studies revealed that the decrease of chemical compounds mainly resulted from enzymatic reaction of secretive enzyme of microbial communities during the fermentation process (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991a</xref>). The activities of PPO, CEL, and PEC sourced from tea leave were inactivated by high temperature in fixing process. Very low activity of POD was remained after the fixing process, which is a kind of hyper-thermoresistant enzyme and could not be secreted by microbial communities during the pile-fermentation of primary dark tea (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). The activities of PPO, CEL, and PEC were increased along with the growth of microbial communities and provided the effective biochemical power to the biotransformation of chemical compounds in the tea leaves during the pile-fermentation process. The catechin was oxidation by PPO, which resulted in the decrease of TP content during the process. The decrease of SS maybe resulted from the growth of microorganisms, which was used as the most important carbon source for microbial communities (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991c</xref>). The decreased of AA was also used as the mainly nitrogen source for the growth of microorganisms (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991b</xref>). The genera <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Uwebraunia</italic>, and <italic>Unclassified Pleosporales</italic> of fungus and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> of bacteria were predominant at 0-h stage of process, but after 3-h stage and 6-h stage, only <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Cyberlindnera</italic> were still dominated in fungal and bacterial community, and maintained a relatively constant until to the end of pile-fermentation process. This shift pattern of microbial communities might be because of the environment changes in the tea pile during fermentation process. Our RDA result also revealed that AA was the important factor shaping the microbial structure. AA, caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were the major nitrogenous compounds of primary dark tea, but caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were heterocyclic compounds, which could hardly be used by microorganisms (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1991b</xref>). Therefore, AA is the most important nitrogen source of microorganisms during the pile-fermentation process of primary dark tea.
