Foxtail millet cultivation &#x0201c;H138&#x0201d; was used for RNA-seq analysis. The data from drought-induced <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptomic sequences of foxtail millet showed that CDPKs were up- or down-regulated by drought to different degrees. In this study, 29 foxtail millet CDPKs were classified into four subgroups. These genes were unevenly distributed on nine foxtail millet chromosomes, and chromosomes 2, 3, and 9 contained the most SiCDPK members. Analysis of putative <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements showed that most foxtail millet CDPK genes contained the ABRE, LTR, HSE, MYB, MYC, DRE, CGTCA-motif, and TGACG-motif <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, which could be activated by abiotic stresses. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that 29 SiCDPK genes experienced different degrees of induction under drought and ABA stresses. <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> had the highest expression levels at 6 and 12 h of drought treatment and was chosen for further analysis. SiCDPK24 localized to the cell membrane and the nucleus of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll protoplasts. Western blot analysis showed that SiCDPK24 protein had autophosphorylation activity. Overexpression of <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> enhanced drought resistance and improved the survival rate under drought stress. It also activated the expressions of nine stress-related genes, namely <italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic>, <italic>RD22</italic>, <italic>KIN1</italic>, <italic>COR15</italic>, <italic>COR47</italic>, <italic>LEA14</italic>, <italic>CBF3/DREB1A</italic>, and <italic>DREB2A</italic>.

Plants have developed a variety of sophisticated strategies to resist abiotic stresses (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bohnert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bray, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1997</xref>). Many stress-responsive genes which can produce or regulate enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of various osmoprotectants, late embryogenesis abundant and glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase proteins are induced in plants to counteract the environmental damage (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Saijo et al., 2000</xref>). Transferring these genes into plants can be used to verify the important roles of induced stress-responsive genes in resisting abiotic stresses (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Holmberg and B&#x000fc;low, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are important with regard to the abiotic stress resistance of plants. They are affected by the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels in plant cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays important roles in a variety of cellular and physiological processes as a second messenger (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh and Greenberg, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Rudd and Franklin-Tong, 2001</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration can be rapidly increased by hormones, light, mechanical disturbances, abiotic stresses, and pathogen elicitors (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Rudd and Franklin-Tong, 2001</xref>). The change of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in plant signals is mediated and transferred by combining with protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation cascades (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Saijo et al., 2000</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx depends on intracellular protein mediators, such as calmodulin (CaM), CDPKs, and calcineurin B-like proteins. Among these intracellular protein mediators of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated protein phosphorylation is performed predominantly by the members of the CDPK family in plants (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Trewavas and Malho, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>). The CDPK family contains a calmodulin-like regulatory domain with four or fewer EF hands, which are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, at the C-terminal end, which can be activated directly through Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Roberts and Harmon, 1992</xref>). They also contain a variable N-terminal domain (often with myristoylation or palmitoylation sites associated with subcellular targeting), a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain, and an auto-inhibitory junction region (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>CDPKs are a very large family in plants. The first <italic>CDPK</italic> gene was found and isolated from soybean (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 1991</xref>). Since then, genes encoding CDPKs have been identified in a wide variety of plant species. Of these, 34 CDPK genes are found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 31 in rice, 40 in maize, and 20 in wheat (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Asano et al., 2005</xref>). CDPKs are widely distributed in plant tissues such as the root, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit; they have different functions and participate in multiple different signaling pathways (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Romeis et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>AtCPK17</italic> and <italic>AtCPK34</italic> are mainly located in mature pollen to regulate the elongation of the pollen tube (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2009</xref>). CDPKs also participate in hormone regulation and stress responses. <italic>AtCPK10</italic> is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated regulation of stomatal movements in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under drought treatment and plays important roles in ABA signaling (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>OsCDPK13</italic>, a CDPK gene from rice, is induced by cold and gibberellin treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abbasi et al., 2004</xref>). CDPKs also play important roles in disease resistance. <italic>StCDPK5</italic> confers resistance to late blight pathogen in transgenic potato plants (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 2012</xref>). The functional diversity of the CDPK family allows one or more of its members to have a role in every stage of plant growth and development.</p><p>Foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>) belongs to the poaceae grass family that is widely cultivated in northern China and India. It is an important food and fodder crop in arid regions and has potential for use as a C4 biofuel. The functions of CDPKs are still unknown in foxtail millet. Foxtail millet cultivation &#x0201c;H138&#x0201d; has been used for RNA-seq analysis and reported to have strong drought resistance (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2013</xref>). We analyzed the foxtail millet whole genome and found 29 CDPK family members. We identified a multiple stress-responsive CDPK gene, and the expression of all 29 CDPK family members was assessed in response to drought. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> had the highest transcript levels after drought treatment and the gene was chosen for further analysis. <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> responded to different stresses and was induced by drought, salt, heat, ABA, and cold. Overexpression of <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants improved tolerance to drought stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>RNA-Seq Analysis</title><p>Four-leaf-stage untreated foxtail millet seedlings were washed off with water, and then the seedlings were dehydrated on a piece of filter paper for 2 h. The samples were collected for RNA-seq analysis. The total RNA of foxtail millet was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, Westlake Village, CA, United States) and the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit for the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States) were used to assess RNA purity and integrity. After assessment, RNA purity was cleaved by using divalent cations in the NEBNext First Strand Synthesis reaction buffer under elevated temperature, and then first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the cleaved RNA fragments using reverse transcriptase and random primers. Subsequently, the double-stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out exploiting DNA polymerase I and RNase H. The cDNA library was prepared and then sequenced by Allwegene Technology Company in Beijing, China. The Illumina HiSeq 4000<sup>TM</sup> platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States) was used for sequencing all libraries. Clean reads were acquired after steps of raw sequence data processing. Before mapping the sequencing reads, adapter sequences were filtered from the raw reads. To obtain more reliable results, low-quality reads (&#x0003e;50% bases with quality scores &#x02264;5) and unknown bases (&#x0003e;10% N bases) were filtered from each dataset. The trinity program was used for the <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly of the high-quality clean reads (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The sequencing reads were mapped to the foxtail millet reference genome using TopHat (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>). To analyze and optimize the gene structure, the mapped sequencing reads were compared against known gene sequences using Cufflinks (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>). The fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) algorithm was used for analyzing gene expression levels, as it is a commonly used method to measure the level of gene expression (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Mortazavi et al., 2008</xref>). The DESeq package (ver. 2.1.0) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) was used to detect DEGs between the &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Drought treatment&#x0201d; samples. The corrected <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>q</italic>-value) &#x02264; 0.05 and |log<sub>2</sub> (fold change)| &#x0003e; 1 were used as the threshold for identifying significant differences in gene expression (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2006</xref>). All optimized DEGs were compared with the database of nonredundant protein (NR), the cluster of orthologous groups, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway, and the gene ontology (GO). Subsequently, the DEG functional classification and enrichment analyses to view the distribution of gene functions were performed by using GOseq and KOBAS software.

The samples were saved at -70&#x000b0;C after freezing in liquid nitrogen. The total RNA was isolated from the whole plants by using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s handbook. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with a PrimeScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (TaKaRa, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of the foxtail millet CDPKs was performed with the SYBR Premix ExTaq<sup>TM</sup> kit (TaKaRa) and an ABI 7500 according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols (Applied Biosystems). The amounts of transcripts accumulated for SiCDPK genes normalized to the internal control <italic>Actin</italic> (Si001873) were determined using the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method. The amount of WT transcripts accumulated after 0 h of drought and ABA stresses was taken as 1.0. The foxtail millet CDPK gene primers for qRT-PCR were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software, avoiding the CDPK conserved domains (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>).

They have also been found to be important in the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. CDPK families in different plants have been analyzed. In this study, we performed BLAST-P searches in NCBI and the published foxtail millet genome (JGI Glyma1.0 annotation), and a total of 29 CDPKs from foxtail millet were identified by using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice CDPK sequences as query sequences. These were designated <italic>SiCDPK1</italic>-<italic>SiCDPK29</italic> according to the proposed nomenclature for CDPK genes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2002</xref>). The structural conservation and divergence of CDPK genes, resulting in gene family expansion and functional conservation or differentiation, is of great significance for research. Structural characteristics, such as acylation sites, active sites, and intron&#x02013;exon structures, show the details of gene family expansion and divergence. All 29 CDPKs had conserved CDPK domains, a variable N-terminal domain, a Ser/Thr kinase domain, an autoinhibitory junction domain, and a calmodulin-like domain (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). Cluster analysis, which was in accord with the evolutionary relationships, indicated that foxtail millet, rice, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CDPKs were divided into four clusters. Cluster I contained 13 foxtail millet CDPK genes, Cluster II contained 6, Cluster III contained 8, and Cluster IV contained 2 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). Introns play important roles in evolution, growth, and development, and research on the role of introns has progressed significantly in recent years. Studies in mammals, nematodes, insects, fungi, and plants have revealed that the introns not only regulate gene expression but also participate in gene evolution (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Rose, 2008</xref>). Gene structure analysis showed that most <italic>SiCDPK</italic> genes had six or seven introns, but <italic>SiCDPK1</italic>, <italic>SiCDPK5</italic>, and <italic>SiCDPK21</italic> had 11 introns.

We speculate that these low intron numbers were because many introns have been lost during the evolution of foxtail millet.</p><p>The analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the promoter regions of CDPK genes revealed elements related to stress responses, such as ABRE, DRE, LTRE, MYB, MYC, and HSE(Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>). MYB participates in drought, low temperature, salt, ABA, and GA stress responses (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>), and MYC participates in drought, salt, and ABA stress responses. ABRE responds to drought and ABA via the combination with ABRE-binding proteins (AREBs) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>). DRE combines DRE-binding proteins (DREBs), which participate in drought, salt, cold, and ABA (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). LTRE contributes primarily to the low-temperature response and regulation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Maestrini et al., 2009</xref>). HSE binds heat shock response elements, leading to the defense against heat stress and even recovery from the damage (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2005</xref>).

However, we also found differences in the transcription patterns of the 29 SiCDPK genes. <italic>SiCDPK1</italic> and <italic>SiCDPK5</italic> from Cluster IV had similar expression patterns: they were both up-regulated by drought and ABA. <italic>SiCDPK9</italic> and <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> from Cluster III were also similarly regulated (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). <italic>SiCDPK20</italic>, <italic>SiCDPK21</italic>, <italic>SiCDPK22</italic>, and <italic>SiCDPK23</italic> belonged to the same subgroup of Cluster I (on the same branch), indicating that they had high homology, and they were all down-regulated by drought. These results indicate that the foxtail millet CDPK genes&#x02019; functions have been conserved in some, but not all, ways.</p><p>Because it had the highest expression at 6 and 12 h of drought treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> was selected for analysis of its expression patterns under drought and ABA stresses. Molecular characterization analyses showed that SiCDPK24 localized to the nucleus and cell membrane (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>). CDPKs are serine&#x02013;threonine protein kinases (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sheen, 1996</xref>). Their functions rely on phosphorylation, which plays important roles in plant calcium signal transduction and response to osmotic stresses (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chehab et al., 2004</xref>). A new study found that potato StCDPK7 protein with autophosphorylation activity could locate in the nucleus and interact with PAL protein, suggesting that the autophosphorylation activity of StCDPK7 protein played important roles in protein location and protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fantino et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, SiCDPK24 protein was proven to have a role in autophosphorylation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>), and may be important for its function. <italic>OsCDPK29</italic> responds to multiple stresses and can be induced by drought, cold, and salt stresses (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2007</xref>). Sequence analyses showed that <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> had high homology with <italic>OsCDPK29</italic> (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref></bold>). These results indicate that these genes are highly conserved in function as well as sequence. Further, the overexpression of <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants enhanced resistance to drought (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>). Many transcription factors and other stress-related genes had been identified, providing evidence that plants have developed flexible molecular and cellular mechanisms to tolerate various abiotic stresses. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the <italic>DREB2A</italic> gene regulates the expression of other stress response genes, such as <italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic>, <italic>RD22</italic>, and <italic>LEA14</italic>. The study found that although the expression levels of <italic>COR15</italic>, <italic>COR47</italic>, and <italic>KIN1</italic> were up-regulated in transgenic <italic>DREB2A Arabidopsis</italic>, they were not valid target genes of <italic>DREB2A</italic>. Further analysis found that <italic>AtDREB1A</italic> plays a key role in regulating the expression levels of <italic>COR15</italic>, <italic>COR47</italic>, and <italic>KIN1</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sakuma et al., 2006</xref>). These are all <italic>CBF/DREB</italic> target genes that are up-regulated in response to drought (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sakuma et al., 2006</xref>). A recent paper reported that the overexpression of <italic>VaCPK29</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> could enhance the expressions of <italic>AtDREB1A</italic> and <italic>AtDREB2A</italic> and improve the tolerance to heat stress, suggesting that CDPK protein kinase could affect the expressions of <italic>CBF/DREB</italic> genes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dubrovina et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that the transcription levels of <italic>AtDREB2A</italic> and <italic>CBF3/DREB1A</italic> were up-regulated after 6 h of drought treatment in the two transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines. Then, the target genes of <italic>CBF/DREB</italic> were detected by qRT-PCR, and the transcription levels of these target genes were dramatically increased in the two transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines, especially after 6 h of drought treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>). By analyzing the relative LUC activities of stress-responsive gene promoters, we found that SiCDPK24 protein could enhance the activities of DREB1A and DREB2A (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref></bold>). These results indicate that a signal pathway might exist in the DREB/CBF gene regulatory network that is stimulated by <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref></bold>). We conclude that the millet CDPK family plays important roles in resisting drought stress, based on our analysis of the characteristics of millet CDPK family members and the functions of the <italic>SiCDPK24</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Z-SX coordinated the project, conceived and designed the experiments, and edited the manuscript.
