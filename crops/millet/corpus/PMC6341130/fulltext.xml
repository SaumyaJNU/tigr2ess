In developing countries, complementary foods that are deficient in both macronutrients and micronutrients coupled with a high burden of infections during the complementary feeding period are major underlying causes of child malnutrition. In Ghana, the recent demographic and health survey (DHS) data showed that 19% and 5% of children under 5&#x000a0;years old are stunted and wasted, respectively (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), Ghana Health Service (GHS), and ICF International, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The survey results further revealed that micronutrient malnutrition is still highly prevalent and persistent with 66% of children under 5&#x000a0;years suffering from varying degrees of anemia.</p><p>One major cause of micronutrient malnutrition in low&#x02010;income populations is the lack of access to a variety of foods (Miller &#x00026; Welch, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Improving the quality of complementary foods is reported to be one of the most cost&#x02010;effective approaches for reducing morbidity and mortality in young children and improving their health (Krebs &#x00026; Hambidge, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) and there is a renewed emphasis on the use of locally available food ingredients for improving complementary foods (Babu, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, a tree found in abundance in the dry tropics, is reported to be a rich source of proteins and micronutrients. The leaves of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> could be harvested and cheaply dried with solar dryers and milled to form a powder that could be stored for use in rural households (Glover&#x02010;Amengor, Aryeetey, Afari, &#x00026; Nyarko, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Among the recent efforts to combat malnutrition by improving the quality of complementary foods in the developing world is the use of <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder (MLP) as a food fortificant (Oyeyinka &#x00026; Oyeyinka, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). To date, however, studies on the suitability of MLP as an ingredient in complementary foods have focused on the proximate composition, sensory analysis, microbiological safety of the foods formulated with MLP and a few observational studies on its potential to improve nutritional status of infants in the first 1000&#x000a0;days of life. Trials demonstrating its long&#x02010;term acceptability and efficacy when incorporated in complementary foods lacking (Glover&#x02010;Amengor et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), although its high protein and micronutrient composition suggest that it may be an effective treatment against malnutrition. The aim of this study was to test the effect of feeding complementary food to which MLP has been added on hemoglobin concentration and growth of infants and young children in Ghana, a developing country. We formulated two hypotheses. Firstly, that infants fed MLP leaf powder as part of a cereal&#x02010;legume blended flour for 4&#x000a0;months would have significantly higher hemoglobin levels and weight and length gain than infants fed the cereal&#x02010;legume blended flour without MLP after 4&#x000a0;months of feeding. We further hypothesized that infants fed MLP as a supplement to be sprinkled on their usual diets would have significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations than infants fed the cereal&#x02010;legume blended flour without MLP, after 4&#x000a0;months of feeding.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Study site and population</title><p>The study was carried out in the Upper Manya Krobo district of the Eastern Region of Ghana. The Eastern region registered the highest rates of stunting and anemia among infants and young children in the demographic and health survey (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), Ghana Health Service (GHS), and ICF International, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Agriculture is the main economic activity of the people of the district, employing about 80% of the population, most of whom are subsistence farmers with very few commercial ones. The study population included infants under two years of age attending weight monitoring sessions at Maternal and Child Health facilities in the Upper Manya Krobo District. Inclusion criteria for infants were as follows: a child must be aged between 8 and 12&#x000a0;months at the time of recruiting; must be breastfeeding; have no congenital abnormalities; have been assigned maternal and child health cards; and whose mothers or caregivers planned to stay at the study site for the duration of the study were eligible for enrollment in the study. Infants who did not meet these criteria were excluded from the study. Additionally, infants who had known intolerances to any of the ingredients of the study foods were excluded from the study. The trial was registered retrospectively with the ISRCTN registry with reference number&#x02014;ISRCTN14377902.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0004"><label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial with 3 arms.

Infants were recruited after consent had been obtained from their mothers or caregivers and assigned to receive one of the three study diets based on the PHC from where the infant was recruited. There was no placebo group because of ethical concerns about providing no treatment to infants who may have tested low on measures (e.g., hemoglobin) at baseline. The feeding period lasted for 16&#x000a0;weeks for each infant.

Each child in study group 1 (<italic>MCL&#x02010;35g</italic>) and study group 3 (<italic>CF&#x02010;35g</italic>) received 35&#x000a0;g of study food per day. Five hundred grams of <italic>MCL&#x02010;35g</italic> and <italic>CF&#x02010;35g</italic> were supplied to mothers/caregivers every two weeks. Infants in study group 2 received MLP as a supplement (<italic>MS&#x02010;5g</italic>) and were supplied with 14, five&#x02010;gram sachets of <italic>MS&#x02010;5g</italic> every two weeks. Mothers were instructed to prepare and feed the study foods a minimum of two times/day in addition to other family foods.

At the bi&#x02010;weekly visits, study foods which were left over from the previous visit were weighed and recorded. Adherence to study foods was determined as the disappearance rate of study foods supplied to infants during the study period. Mothers were educated on good hygienic practices and also encouraged to continue breastfeeding. Mothers/caregivers were given plates and spoons for feeding their infants. Study foods were given at no charge to infants.</p><p>Morbidity data (diarrhea, vomiting, symptoms of respiratory infections, and fever) were collected every 2&#x000a0;weeks at the same time as a fresh consignment of project foods were delivered to the caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0009"><label>2.7</label><title>Endline</title><p>At endline, data on anthropometric measurements, 24&#x02010;hr recalls and hemoglobin concentration were collected.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0010"><label>2.8</label><title>Data analyses</title><p>Data analyses were done using Statistics package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20, (IBM, USA, 2011). At baseline, characteristics of groups were summarized using descriptive statistics and cross&#x02010;tabulations and factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to create a wealth index which was categorized into low, middle, and high. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons was used to determine any significant differences in baseline and endline values for mean change in hemoglobin, weight gain, and length gain among the three study groups at the end of the study. Adjustments were made for wealth index and morbidity (due to group differences) and baseline values whenever possible. Infant sex, maternal education and maternal height and BMI were pre&#x02010;specified covariates and controlled for where necessary. All analyses were done first without controlling for covariates and then with covariates. Paired <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;test was used to make within&#x02010;group comparisons for hemoglobin concentration at baseline and endline. To compare categorical outcomes (anemia, stunting, wasting, and underweight) across the three groups at endline, binary logistic regression was used, whilst relative risks were used for pairwise group comparisons. Chi&#x02010;squared tests were used to compare percentages of infants (within group) who were anemic, stunted, wasted, and underweight at baseline to their respective percentages at endline. Occurrence of illness, estimated as percentage of completed visits with reported (by mothers or caregivers of infants) illness during the preceding 14&#x000a0;days, were compared between the groups. Morbidity data were natural log&#x02010;transformed before comparison by ANCOVA. The analysis was by intention to treat, that is, children were included in the analyses, whether or not they consumed the full dose of study food during the intervention period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0011"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0012"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>Of 372 eligible infants, 363 were allotted to one of the three study groups.

Comparison of the outcomes at endline revealed that the three groups did not differ significantly in the percentages of children at endline were anemic, underweight, stunted, and wasted.

There was a significant difference in adherence with the <italic>CF&#x02010;35g</italic> group having significantly higher adherence than the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups. The difference in adherence between the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups was however not statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0019"><label>4</label><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Findings of this study were contrary to the study hypotheses which predicted that the infants who were fed complementary foods that incorporated MLP would have significantly higher increase in the primary outcome hemoglobin concentration. The mean change in hemoglobin concentration was numerically higher for infants in the control arm (who did not have any MLP), when compared to infants in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. This finding is notwithstanding of the fact that <italic>Moringa</italic> leaves are rich in beta carotene and can thus be utilized as an important source of vitamin A, a vitamin which is useful for facilitating the release of iron from storage sites and thus helping to improve hemoglobin levels (Zongo, Zoungrana, Savadogo, &#x00026; Traor&#x000e9;, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Several factors may help explain the findings of this study;</p><p>Firstly, the 5&#x02010;g daily supply of MLP (from MCL&#x02010;35g and MS&#x02010;5g) added only 1.13&#x000a0;mg of iron to nutrient intakes of infants in those two study groups. This level which translates into 10% of the Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) for iron for infants aged between six to 23&#x000a0;months is far lower than the WHO's recommendation of nearly 100% of iron requirements for infants aged 6&#x02013;23&#x000a0;months coming from complementary foods (WHO, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). The 5&#x000a0;g daily dose of MLP incorporated in infants&#x02019; complementary foods was chosen due to concerns about acceptability of foods that are fortified with higher levels of MLP (Oyeyinka &#x00026; Oyeyinka, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). With the exception of two studies, one unpublished graduate thesis conducted in Tanzania (Andrew, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and a longitudinal study conducted among malnourished children in Burkina Faso (Zongo et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), the authors are not aware of any published randomized controlled trials that have studied the supplementation of diets of infants in this age group (8&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months) with MLP. For the Tanzanian study, children, aged from six to 24&#x000a0;months who were patients in a nutrition rehabilitation unit, were randomly allocated to receive either 250&#x000a0;g of maize porridge to which 25&#x000a0;g of MLP was added or 250&#x000a0;g of plain maize porridge daily for three months (two months at the rehabilitation unit and one month at home). The study reported a significant difference in hemoglobin levels among infants at endline with infants who received MLP having higher hemoglobin concentrations (Andrew, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Infants in Tanzanian study received five times more MLP compared to infants in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups of this study received who received 5&#x000a0;g of MLP daily. The lower intake of MLP for infants in this study may have accounted for the results obtained. The Tanzania study did not report adherence to study foods but infants were fed under supervision at the rehabilitation unit for two out of the three months that their study lasted. In this study, infants were fed in their homes with no supervision by research staff. Adherence (which was determined as total percent of study food disappeared over the study duration) was 62% and 61%, respectively, for the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups (MCL&#x02010;35g and MS&#x02010;5g) and 80% for the control CF&#x02010;35g group. The Burkina Faso study (Zongo et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), similar to the Tanzania study, compared two groups of malnourished children aged between 6 and 59&#x000a0;months; one group received a 10&#x000a0;g daily dose of MLP for 6&#x000a0;months, whilst the control group did not receive any MLP. The average weight gained daily (8.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.30&#x000a0;g/kg/day) which was observed in children who were fed the MLP was significantly higher than in children (5.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.72&#x000a0;g/kg/day) who did not receive the MLP but there was no significant increase in hemoglobin levels, observed in either group. Zongo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) have however stated that their findings might be better interpreted when complemented by an analyses of other parameters of iron deficiency such as transferrin, ferritin serum, and other biomarkers of inflammation. This is because improvement in nutritional status may not necessarily reflect in changes in single biological parameters such as hemoglobin. With respect to the hemoglobin concentrations, the findings of Zongo et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) are comparable to the findings of this study. It was not possible to ascertain whether infants alone were fed all the study foods that disappeared as they were not monitored by direct observation. Similar to the results of the acceptability trial (Boateng et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), mothers in the efficacy trial (including mothers in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups) expressed largely positive feedback when asked to comment on their children's liking of foods over the study period and their willingness to feed their infants the study foods in the future. Such responses however may not be definitive as respondents might be reluctant to provide negative assessments (Adu&#x02010;Afarwuah, Lartey, Zeilani, &#x00026; Dewey, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). A comparison of the 80% adherence observed in the control group who ate Weanimix alone to the adherence obtained for the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups however indicated that those study foods may not have been very well accepted by the infants who were assigned to receive them, irrespective of the findings of the acceptability trial indicated that the study foods were acceptable in the population (Boateng et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).</p><p>This study's findings with respect to adherence is consistent with reported findings in the literature which indicate that, despite their improved nutritional quality, increasing levels of MLP could reduce the acceptance of MLP&#x02010;fortified foods (Oyeyinka &#x00026; Oyeyinka, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In this study, percent fortification of MLP was 15% compared to the 11% fortification in the Tanzanian study. Percent fortification is not reported in the Burkina Faso study.</p><p>Another factor which may have influenced the hemoglobin results was the food given to infants who were in the control arm of this study, whereas both the Tanzanian study and the Burkinabe study fed plain porridges to infants in their control groups, this study fed a cereal&#x02010;legume blend (Weanimix). The superiority of cereal&#x02010;legume blends in terms of protein and energy densities, compared with maize, millet or sorghum&#x02010;only porridges which are less nutritious, (Amagloh et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) may have accounted for the study findings, where the infants in the control group had better nutritional outcomes comparatively.</p><p>The duration of feeding employed in this study may also have accounted for the observed change in the hemoglobin concentration from baseline to endline. The four&#x02010;month study duration chosen for this study was informed by the duration of both the Tanzanian study and the Burkina Faso study which lasted 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, respectively. Both studies were conducted among malnourished infants who were patients of rehabilitation units. Given that infants in this study were recruited from a healthy population, an average duration of four months of feeding was considered feasible. However, this duration might have been inadequate to observe any significant results in hemoglobin and growth indices, given that the daily dose of MLP given to infants in this trial was far lower than what was given in the two studies stated.</p><p>Bioavailability of iron in MLP also might have been a challenge. A recent animal study conducted by Gallaher et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) concluded that bioavailability of iron in <italic>Moringa</italic> is low. Gallaher et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) further suggested that the low bioavailability of iron from <italic>Moringa</italic> is due to its high phytic acid concentration and that the use of dried <italic>Moringa</italic> leaves, to improve iron status might not be successful and may even result in a worsening of iron status. The authors however concluded that processing of <italic>Moringa</italic> leaves to reduce or remove its phytic acid could improve it iron bioavailability (Gallaher et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).</p><p>Occurrence of morbidity reported by mothers and caregivers over the period of the study is another factor that may have influenced the results of this study. Infants in the CF&#x02010;35g group had significantly lower reported morbidity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3890-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>) and this may explain why their hemoglobin levels improved the most of the three groups, and significantly less infants were anemic at endline in that group. Similarly, it is not surprising that the <italic>MCL&#x02010;35</italic>g group which reported significantly higher morbidity compared to the two other study groups had the least observed increase in hemoglobin levels. Worm infestation and infectious diseases such as malaria and diarrhea are associated with low hemoglobin concentrations (Agho, Dibley, D'Este, &#x00026; Gibberd, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In the Tanzanian study, children were dewormed and treated against malaria and other infections before the intervention begun and this may have positively influenced their hemoglobin concentrations at endline. In this study, mothers and caregivers who reported infant morbidity were referred to the primary healthcare centers for medical care. Although not explicitly reported, infants in the Burkina Faso study might have also benefited from treatment of infections as they were patients of a nutrition rehabilitation unit. This study recruited healthy infants in the community and did not carry out treatment of infections prior to the intervention, thus, it is possible that the presence of sub&#x02010;clinical infections may have influenced morbidity and partly accounted for the lack of significance in the results of the hemoglobin concentrations among the groups at endline. It is also likely that MLP supplementation may be more beneficial for severely malnourished infants as was observed in both the Tanzanian and Burkina Faso studies, rather than for healthy infants.</p><p>It is not clear why of the three study groups, the MCL&#x02010;35g group recorded the highest reported morbidity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3890-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). All foods were hygienically produced and aseptically packaged at the Food Research Institute (FRI) in Accra and samples were taken from batches of prepared study foods regularly for microbiological testing. Indeed, had there been any contamination originating from the food preparation and packaging, there should have been similar levels of morbidity reported in all three groups. One factor that may have contributed to the reported morbidity in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups, may be due to the MLP itself. Although there is little published data on adverse reactions to MLP, being a concentrated and fibrous product, which was fed to infants and young children, it may have elicited symptoms of morbidity (particularly diarrhea) which was noted and reported by the mothers/caregivers who participated in the study. This is irrespective of the fact that it was incorporated as small quantities in infants&#x02019; complementary foods and mothers were also taught to thoroughly stir/mix as well as cook/heat before feeding to infants. The study in Tanzania reported the mean age of infants was 14&#x000a0;months whilst the mean age was 9&#x000a0;months in this study. The Burkina Faso study reported the age range of infants as 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months, but did not report the mean age of infants. On the average, the older children in the Tanzania study (and possibly the Burkina Faso study) may have been better able to tolerate the MLP and hence, the lower levels of observed morbidity and significantly better nutritional outcomes observed in the <italic>Moringa</italic> groups of those studies.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the differences in the morbidity observed may probably have to do with the socioeconomic indicators of the households in the clusters to which the study foods were randomly allocated. A higher proportion of households of infants (81%) in the control group (CF&#x02010;35g) used improved sources of drinking water such as standpipes, boreholes/wells compared to 49% and 41% in the MCL&#x02010;35g and MS&#x02010;5g groups respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3890-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Poor hygiene and sanitation may have played key roles in the levels of morbidity and hence the hemoglobin levels observed in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> arms of the study, at endline. These findings remained the same however, even after controlling for source of drinking water. Supply of clean water and environmental sanitation have been frequently reported in the scientific literature as factors that are associated with hemoglobin levels among the 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months&#x02019; age group of infants (Agho et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Further explanation for the morbidity findings of this study may be the fact that, infants in the control group had significantly more food (80%) disappearing, compared to the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups. Thus, it is likely that the control infants were probably better nourished and therefore better able to fight infections when compared to infants in the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups.</p><p>The pattern of weight gain and length gain observed in this study was similar to that observed for the hemoglobin concentration. (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3890-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Contrary to the study hypothesis, the infants in the control arm gained weight and length which was significantly higher at endline, compared to the two <italic>Moringa</italic> groups. However, a comparison of the differences in the WHO growth indicators, weight&#x02010;for&#x02010;length <italic>z</italic>&#x02010;scores (WLZ), length&#x02010;for&#x02010;age <italic>z</italic>&#x02010;scores (LAZ) and weight&#x02010;for&#x02010;age <italic>z</italic>&#x02010;scores (WAZ) (Supporting Information <xref rid="fsn3890-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix S1</xref>) from baseline to endline showed no statistically significant difference between the three study groups. There were also no significant differences in percentages of infants who were wasted, stunted, and underweight at both baseline and endline across the groups (Supporting Information <xref rid="fsn3890-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix S3</xref>). This is contrary to findings of the Tanzanian study where, WAZ, WLZ, and MUAC scores improved significantly for infants in the <italic>Moringa</italic> supplemented group when compared to infants in the control group. The LAZ scores however showed no statistically significant difference (Andrew, <xref rid="fsn3890-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). For the Burkina Faso study also, MUAC and WAZ also improved significantly among MLP&#x02010;supplemented infants. The reasons for the findings of the anthropometric measurements of this study may be similar to what has been discussed for the hemoglobin levels observed. In retrospect, this study design could have been stronger if a fourth study group, comprising of infants who were not fed with any of the study foods, had been included in the study. However due to practical and budgetary reasons, this was not considered acceptable to the community or feasible.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. Funding constraints greatly influenced the numbers of infants we could recruit to start with, as well as even the numbers of infants who could complete the study. This high attrition rate consequently resulted in a low power at the end of the study. A further limitation of this study was that it was not possible to mask the fieldworkers who were responsible for delivering the study foods or the mothers who received the foods, to the design of the study. Also, data on use of multivitamin supplements were not collected and hence could not be controlled for in the data analyses. These limitations notwithstanding, one strength of this study was the fairly equivalent numbers of children who completed the study in each of the 3 groups, thus allowing for statistical comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0020"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Findings of our study indicated that feeding infants with complementary foods fortified with a daily dose of 5&#x000a0;g of MLP was not beneficial in significantly improving their hemoglobin concentrations or growth indicators when compared to infants who did not receive any MLP in their complementary foods, after 4&#x000a0;months of feeding. From these findings, it can be speculated that perhaps, the control food, Weanimix, may be nutritionally adequate for infants in the population studied. Further studies are needed to explore especially, the long&#x02010;term acceptability of complementary foods fortified with MLP with particular focus on morbidity. The possibility of recruiting a non&#x02010;intervention group whose outcome measures will be measured at endline only should also be considered in subsequent studies, as such a group may better help with comparison of outcome measures at endline.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0022"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3890-sec-0023"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>LB, AO, MA, and MS&#x02010;A wrote and implemented the study.
