Previous studies showed that plant-derived polyphenolic compounds were the most potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents among all natural compounds. The present study indicates that bound polyphenols of inner shell (BPIS) from foxtail millet bran can display anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced HT-29 cells and in nude mice. Mechanistically, BPIS restrained the level of various pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8), and enhanced the expression level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) by blocking the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B)-p65 nuclear translocation. Further, we found the elevated miR-149 expression by BPIS-induced ROS accumulation, directly targeted the Akt expression to block NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation. Taken together, these novel findings provide new insights into the development of BPIS as an anti-inflammatory agent via the signaling cascade of ROS/miR-149/Akt/NF-&#x003ba;B axis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>foxtail millet bran</kwd><kwd>bound polyphenols</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>miR-149</kwd><kwd>anti-inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Clinically, the postoperative infections are a pressing public health challenge, and are primarily attributed to bacteria and viruses. Lipopolysaccharides, a major component of gram-negative bacterial cell wall play a crucial role to provoke the immune response [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which lead to chronic inflammation and cancer recurrence particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In general, inflammation is a complex physiological response of body tissues to disease causing irritants, which aims to remove the harmful stimuli and promotes wound healing [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, long-term inflammatory reactions are considered as the new malignant phenotype of cancer cells and diffusely approved that chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in the early stage of cancer [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the maladjustment of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8, are inflammatory biomarkers in animal experiments and clinical studies [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, controlling LPS-induced inflammatory factors might reduce CRC risk and improve the clinical prospect.</p><p>Foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>), one of the oldest cultivated cereals in China, contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals and proteins containing significant abundance of essential amino acids profile [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Foxtail millet bran, the by-product of foxtail millet processing, is an excellent source of phytochemicals, among which polyphenols exhibit a wide range of pharmacological and medicinal characteristics [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Content of plant-derived polyphenols such as ferulic acid, coumaric acid, cinnamic and gentisic acid of finger millet, pearl millet, teff millet, fonio millet and foxtail millet have been reported [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Naturally occuring polyphenols, existing mainly as bound forms, were found to possess anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation effects [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Such effects were observed both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and were believed due to their free radical scavenging [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Whereas, there is a growing evidence indicated that bound polyphenols could also act as pro-oxidant chemical messengers in tumor cells and normal cells [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, it was shown that BPIS possesses a broad-spectrum anti-tumor property and such property was associated with elevation of ROS [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the mechanism how ROS levels are linked with anti-inflammation property is not known in HT-29 cells.</p><p>It has been reported that ROS is able to activate the p53 tumor suppressor protein which regulates downstream gene expression by acting as a transcriptional factor [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Activation of p53 results in inhibition of miRNA expression [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MiRNAs function as either tumor suppressor gene or oncogene depending on their target genes. The regulation of target gene expression by MiRNA is achieved by direct binding to the mRNA of target gene [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, ROS is able to affect the expression of specific miRNAs through its ability to regulate p53 activity. Although it has been found that BPIS causes increased production of ROS in cancer cells, whether the increase of cellular ROS can affect the expression of a particular miRNA and its downstream target genes is poorly understood.</p><p>Our results showed that BPIS could reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8 and IL-6) and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by blocking NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation. Mechanistically, BPIS treatment of HT-29 cells promoted the ROS accumulation leading to the increase of miR-149 expression. In addition, we found that miR-149 directly targeted the 3&#x02032;-UTR of Akt to inhibit its downstream NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and then attenuated expression of pro-inflammatory molecules in LPS-induced HT-29 cells. Hence, the present data suggest that the millet bran-derived BPIS is a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent for attenuating LPS-mediated inflammation in CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Inhibitory effects of BPIS on the pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced HT-29 cells</title><p>LPS initiates inflammatory responses and develop inflammation by expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-8 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether BPIS could suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS in HT-29 cells. The results showed that BPIS and LPS co-treatment significantly inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2; level from 102.51&#x000b1;15.02 pg/ml to 56.44&#x000b1;8.62pg/ml, IL-6 from 48.31&#x000b1;7.15 pg/ml to 23.06&#x000b1;3.58 pg/ml, IL-8 from 65.36&#x000b1;5.03 pg/ml to 37.88&#x000b1;4.72 pg/ml and the increased secretion of IL-10 from 13.91&#x000b1;2.84 pg/ml to 23.47&#x000b1;3.41 pg/ml in LPS-induced HT-29 cells, yet no significant change has found in TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Furthermore, the localization of NF-&#x003ba;B-p65 was determined by western blot analysis.

To determine whether the suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B by BPIS-induced related to Akt signaling pathway, the effects of BPIS on total Akt, Akt phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B-p65 were tested. We found that BPIS and LPS co-treatment significantly declined the total Akt, Akt phosphorylation and NF-&#x003ba;B-p65 as compared to the LPS individual treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

To investigate the possible involvement of ROS in BPIS-induced anti-inflammatory activities, ROS production followed by BPIS treatment was tested in LPS-induced HT-29 cells. The results showed that BPIS significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) enhanced the intracellular ROS accumulation and miR-149 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). As expected, NAC, an inhibitor of ROS, noticeably reversed miR-149 upregulation and ROS cumulation of BPIS-induced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), including BPIS-inhibited the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-10 in both RNA and protein level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>).

Initiating and sustaining various inflammatory responses are regulated by pro-inflammatory molecules (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-8) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, the capability and mechanism of BPIS to reduce inflammatory responses was investigated. We have found that IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 were downregulated, particularly IL-6 production was more strongly inhibited and IL-10 was upregulated by the BPIS treatment of LPS-induced HT-29 cells. However, TNF-&#x003b1; was unchanged. Therefore, we hypothesized that BPIS significantly reduce the level of IL-6 via suppressing the levels of NF-&#x003ba;B and STAT3 in the same time. Because it is well known that IL-6 was significantly elevated due to STAT3 and NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, TNF-&#x003b1; has no markable changes by BPIS treatment. Some studies show that mutant p53 amplifies the aggressive behavior of cancer cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines and TNF-&#x003b1;. Furthermore, HT-29 is a p53 mutant colon cancer cell line. We speculated that TNF-&#x003b1; has no markable changes by BPIS treatment, because mutant P53 enhanced TNF-a secretion [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments showed that BPIS displayed the same effects in a xenograft mice model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Cancer cells usually have a higher level of ROS, and over-expression of antioxidant enzymes in comparison with normal cells. Therefore, cancer cells are more potent to break ROS threshold by producing additional ROS, which lead to the apoptosis of cancer cell. Our previous study also showed that we could obtain 50mg of BPIS from 2g of foxtail millet bran and BPIS can induce the accumulation of ROS [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. ROS have been independently linked to both inflammation and miRNA regulation [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More recently, miRNAs caught a considerable attention of scientists, partly because of their key contribution of in understanding of anti-inflammatory effects of multiple drugs [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, the role of ROS, miRNA and various inflammation factors as well as their relationship in the development of CRC remains poorly understood. Previous studies reported a downregulation of miR-149 in NSCLC cells, and the expression of miR-149 was inversely correlated with the EMT phenotype of NSCLC cells. Hence, miR-149 functioned as a tumor suppressor [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, Our previous study found that BPIS could restrain the growth of tumor tissue. In addition, the expression of miR-149 was significantly increased in BPIS-treated tumor tissues. Therefore, we speculate that miR-149 may play a positive role in tumor suppression resulted from BPIS treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Furthermore, BPIS induced miR-149 up-regulation in HT-29 cells was attenuated by inclusion of ROS inhibitor NAC in the treatment step (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) suggesting that ROS played an important role in BPIS induced miR-149 up-regulation. Subsequently, we identified that Akt is a target gene of miR-149 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results prove that BPIS activates the existence of an ROS/miRNA-149/anti-inflammation framework.</p><p>Inflammation promotes tumorigenesis by activating NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The atypical increased in Akt phosphorylation might contribute to the development of inflammation [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In this study, BPIS strongly inhibits the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated inflammatory responses by suppressing the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the total expression of NF-&#x003ba;B in LPS-stimulated HT-29 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Furthermore, our study also showed that BPIS inhibited NF-&#x003ba;B expression by suppressing Akt phosphorylation in LPS-induced HT-29 cells, and pretreatment with Akt phosphorylation activator IGF-1 abolished BPIS&#x02019;s inhibitory effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results implicate that Akt, a target gene of miR-149, is necessary for NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated inflammation.</p><p>In conclusion, BPIS inhibits the initiation and progression of CRC by ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment, and the presence of a signaling cascades of ROS / miR-149 / Akt / NF-&#x003ba;B axis for BPIS-mediated resistance to inflammation in LPS-induced HT-29 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).
