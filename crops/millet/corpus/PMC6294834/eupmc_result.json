    "Introduction:The traditional method of producing instant foods involves producing a gelatinised paste from the preferred grain flour and proceeding to dry it using a drum drier. This produced a flaked product, which can be used as is or ground and sieved to obtain the desired particle size. With the advent of extrusion cooking technology and diverse production processes associated with the technology, food products including instant foods from cereals were developed. Objectives:The primary objective of this study was to produce a nutritious and acceptable pearl millet instant beverage powder (PMIBP) using combination processing. Methods:The effect of different processing methods (malting, extrusion, and a combination of both processes) on the nutritional, biochemical, and sensory characteristics of beverage powders and beverages made from two varieties of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) were evaluated. Results:Combination processing led to a significant (p â‰¤ 0.05) decrease in total fat and total dietary fibre (TDF) (3.85 and 22.99 g/100 g, respectively) of AgriGreen (AgG) extruded malted pearl millet (EMPM) and extruded raw pearl millet-malted pearl millet mix (ERPMMPM). Combination processing also led to a decrease in the ash, total fat, TDF, Fe and Zn content (1.76, 3.48, 14.26 g/100 g, 7.78 and 4.74 mg/100 g, respectively) of Babala (Ba) EMPM and Ba ERPMMPM (1.88, 4.22, 21.71 g/100 g, 7.24 and 4.14 mg/100 g, respectively). Beverages of 10% total solids were prepared from the samples and offered to an untrained consumer panel. The beverages were rated on appearance, colour, aroma, flavour, texture and overall acceptability on a nine-point hedonic scale. In general, Ba raw pearl millet was rated 4 (like slightly), AgG malted pearl millet was rated 6 (dislike slightly), and all other pearl millet samples from both varieties were rated 5 (neither like nor dislike). Conclusion:Although combination processing led to an increase in carbohydrates, Ca, energy, Fe content, and 12 of the 15 amino acids measured as well as protein and starch digestibility and no change in the other nutrients measured, this did not significantly impact on the acceptability of the beverages."
