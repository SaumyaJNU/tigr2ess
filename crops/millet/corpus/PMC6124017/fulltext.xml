To assess the molecular effects of aging on B cell development, we profiled gene expression and chromatin features genome-wide, including histone modifications and chromosome conformation, in bone marrow pro-B and pre-B cells from young and aged mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Our analysis reveals that the expression levels of most genes are generally preserved in B cell precursors isolated from aged compared with young mice. Nonetheless, age-specific expression changes are observed at numerous genes, including microRNA encoding genes. Importantly, these changes are underpinned by multi-layered alterations in chromatin structure, including chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, long-range promoter interactions, and nuclear compartmentalization. Previous work has shown that differentiation is linked to changes in promoter-regulatory element interactions. We find that aging in B cell precursors is accompanied by rewiring of such interactions. We identify transcriptional downregulation of components of the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, in particular downregulation of Irs1 and upregulation of Let-7 microRNA expression, as a signature of the aged phenotype. These changes in expression are associated with specific alterations&#x000a0;in H3K27me3 occupancy, suggesting that Polycomb-mediated repression plays a role in precursor B cell aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Changes in chromatin and 3D genome organization play an important role in shaping the altered gene expression profile of aged precursor B cells.

This results in refractory responses to vaccination, loss of previously established immunity, and substantial increases in susceptibility to infection. Unravelling the molecular changes and mechanisms underlying aging phenotypes is thus an important task for biology. The B cell population is a critical pillar of adaptive immunity, involved in generating protective antibodies, presenting antigens, and regulating immune responses. B cells develop continuously in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells through several precursor stages, including pro-B cells, where immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) recombination occurs, followed by pre-B cells in which the immunoglobulin light chains (IgK or IgL) recombine. Inherent inefficiencies in the recombination process lead to substantial cell loss at each stage. To provide adequate numbers of B cells to ensure a diverse antibody repertoire, recombination events alternate with proliferative expansion at each stage to restore depleted B cell numbers. Pro-B cell expansion is controlled by the interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], potentiated by the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], while progression to the pre-B cell stage is characterized by signaling through both the IL7R and the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) which is composed of the productively recombined IgH and the invariant surrogate light chain (SL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thereafter, the pre-BCR assumes control of both pre-B cell proliferation and IgK recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This pro-B to pre-B transition also requires IGF1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The size of precursor B cell subsets and the primary antibody repertoire are reduced during aging (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), which, together with defects in maturation of the antigen-responsive repertoire, substantially reduces the antibody response to infection during aging. In particular, the size of the pre-B cell pool is reduced in the aged mouse, indicating that aging-specific defects arise early in B cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In vivo labeling experiments show that the progression of B cell progenitors through the pro- and pre-B cell stages is also diminished with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is evidence of both B cell-intrinsic defects (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) as well as defects in the stromal cell compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which supports developmental progression, but the underlying causes of these changes remain to be elucidated (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). In particular, the nature and extent of changes in gene expression in aged B cell precursors are unknown.</p><p id="Par16">The advent of new technologies in functional genomics enables illumination of the changes in B cell development that occur during aging genome-wide. Recently, application of these technologies to aging human T cells has provided profound insight into widespread epigenetic changes that impair the function of closely related lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system. In particular, aging CD8+ T cells lose chromatin accessibility at promoters, which may compromise their metabolic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Comparison of aging human lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood has revealed concordant downregulation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression of components of the IL7R signaling pathway in CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells, suggesting that epigenetic dysfunction in shared pathways in aging requires careful unravelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Here we present an integrated analysis of the transcriptome, epigenetic landscape, and higher-order chromatin structure in young and aged pro- and pre-B cells from mouse bone marrow. We show that aging affects the expression of a limited number of genes, in particular key components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. These alterations in the transcriptome are accompanied by perturbations of multiple regulatory layers affecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and polycomb-mediated epigenetic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Gene expression changes in B cell precursors in aged mice</title><p id="Par18">Using multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis of the bone marrow B cell compartment, we found substantial changes in the B cell precursor pools in aged mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Our analysis revealed a roughly twofold reduction in pro-B (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and an almost threefold reduction in pre-B cell numbers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) in the bone marrow of aged (19&#x02013;22&#x000a0;months) compared with young mice (three&#x000a0;months), consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, we found an increase in recirculating mature B cells in the bone marrow of aged mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Reduction in average pro-B and pre-B cell numbers upon aging. <bold>a</bold> Representative <italic>flow cytometry plots</italic> showing the gating strategy used to isolate pro- and pre-B cells from young and aged bone marrow following depletion of non-B cells.

Transcriptome analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-depleted total RNA identified 82 significantly upregulated and 54 downregulated genes in aged pro-B cells and 23 upregulated and 33 downregulated genes in aged pre-B cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S2 and S3). Seventeen of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in both pro- and pre-B cells (including age-upregulated <italic>Rnf125</italic>, <italic>Dock9</italic>, <italic>Iigp1</italic>, <italic>Igj</italic>, and age-downregulated <italic>Irs1</italic>, <italic>Rftn2</italic>, <italic>Plxna2</italic>, and <italic>Igf2bp3</italic>). Overall, age-specific expression changes were correlated between pro- and pre-B cells, even when significance was reached in only one of the cell types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Several of the age-upregulated genes, particularly in pro-B cells, have known roles in late stages of B cell development; these include <italic>Igj</italic>, <italic>Faim3</italic> (Fc receptor for IgM), and genes coding for Major Histocompatibility Complex proteins, such as <italic>Cd74</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). This could be explained by aberrant expression of mature B cell-specific genes in the aged pro-B cells. However, we cannot exclude the presence of a small number of contaminating mature B cells in the sorted aged pro-B cell population. The latter may be due to the increased number of recirculating mature B cells, and the less distinct separation between B cell precursors (IgM-) and mature cells (IgM+), in the aged bone marrow (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Therefore, we excluded mature B cell-specific genes from further analyses and chose to focus primarily on age-downregulated genes, since we are confident that they do not arise from this potential contamination.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Gene expression changes upon aging in pro- and pre-B cells. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>

Genes whose expression decreased upon aging in pro-B cells were frequently downregulated during the pro-B to pre-B cell transition in young cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1a, blue points); examples include <italic>Rftn2</italic>, <italic>Plxna2</italic>, <italic>Cdc42bpa</italic>, <italic>Plxdc2</italic>, and <italic>Pcdh9</italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1b). This suggests that these genes are either prematurely downregulated in aged pro-B cells or that they fail to be upregulated at an earlier developmental stage in the aged cells. Conversely, genes with reduced expression in aged pre-B cells were often upregulated in the pro-B to pre-B cell transition in young mice (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1a, red points); examples include <italic>Irs1</italic> (Insulin Receptor Substrate 1) and the PI3K-AKT pathway antagonist <italic>Inpp4b</italic> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1b)<italic>.</italic> This pattern suggests a failure to upregulate these genes as the aged B cell progenitors progress to the pre-B cell stage. Notably, several genes downregulated upon aging at the pro-B and/or pre-B cell stage encode components of the IGF signaling pathway, such as <italic>Irs1</italic> and <italic>Igf1r</italic>. Indeed, <italic>Irs1</italic>, a key component of this pathway, was found to be the most significantly downregulated gene in pre-B cells upon aging at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level. We therefore examined IRS1 protein levels and found that these were decreased upon aging in both pro-B and pre-B cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), demonstrating that age-specific mRNA changes of <italic>Irs1</italic> are propagated into reduced protein levels.</p><p id="Par21">Total RNA levels reflect both the rate of transcription and downstream processes such as RNA stability. To explore the effects of aging on gene transcription more directly, we isolated nuclear RNA from young and aged pro-B cells to enrich for nascent transcripts and profiled global changes in intronic transcription as a specific measure of nascent transcription.

Comparing young to aged pro-B cells, no H3K27me3 peaks passed the multiple testing correction in the differential enrichment analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8).

However, this does not exclude the possibility that more subtle changes in the epigenomic landscape might play a broader role in shaping the gene expression profile of aged compared to young B cell precursors. Therefore, we tested whether changes in chromatin, identified using a low stringency threshold, were generally accompanied by altered gene expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S10; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S6&#x02013;S9) and whether genes with altered expression were characterized by remodelled chromatin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This revealed not only that changes in chromatin upon aging, especially H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 occupancy, likely impact on gene expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S10), but further, that if there is a change in gene expression, this is frequently linked to changes in chromatin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It is noteworthy that H3K4me3 and H3K27ac agree more with differential gene expression than chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S10). This is in line with the fact that chromatin accessibility is not necessarily linked to active gene expression but can also be found over other regulatory elements such as insulators, while H3K4me3 and H3K27ac are more strongly linked to actively transcribed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Gene expression changes are linked to chromatin changes upon aging in B cell precursors.

We then derived correlation coefficients comparing the age-related log2 fold changes in enrichment for overlapping peaks from each pairwise combination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S11, left). The highest correlation was observed for log2 fold changes in the same chromatin mark in pro-B versus pre-B cells, consistent with the correlation between age-related gene expression changes at these two developmental stages. We also observed a positive correlation between changes in ATAC-seq and H3K4me3 in aging, but less so between either of these and H3K27ac, in line with the non-redundant nature of these chromatin features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The majority of correlation coefficients increased when considering only pairs of peaks for which at least one ranked highly (top 10%) in significance (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S11, right).

To do this, we employed chromHMM, an unsupervised machine-learning approach that employs a multivariate Hidden Markov Model and segments the genome into characteristic chromatin states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We chose a 16-state model based on balancing within-class homogeneity and between-class heterogeneity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). This model was further collapsed into six broader classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>), termed &#x02018;polycomb&#x02019; (prevalence of repressive H3K27me3 mark), &#x02018;bivalent&#x02019; (presence of active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 marks), &#x02018;active promoter&#x02019; (prevalence of H3K4me3), &#x02018;active regulatory region&#x02019; (H3K27ac), &#x02018;insulator&#x02019; (CTCF), and &#x02018;background&#x02019; (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). We first measured the coverage of each chromatin state over both promoters and regulatory elements (defined as the union between ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq peaks for histone modifications and CTCF in pre-B cells) genome-wide and assigned each to the chromatin state covering the largest proportion, excluding background except if no other state was present. The proportion of regions assigned to each state was very similar in young and aged cells, particularly for promoters (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S12a, b). Over half of all promoters were in the active promoter state, with significant subsets also assigned to the polycomb and bivalent states; indeed the majority of regulatory regions in these three states mapped to a transcription start site (TSS), in contrast to the active regulatory region and insulator states which were rarely localized at TSSs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S12c).

While the majority of promoters displayed minimal changes in state occupancy upon aging (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S12), we selected a subset of genes that displayed the largest magnitude changes over their promoters. In order to integrate these changes and identify groups of genes whose promoters displayed similar transitions in their chromatin state, we used unsupervised clustering. This segregated the promoters into nine clusters displaying different patterns of state changes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, top; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S10). These genes also frequently displayed modulations in gene expression consistent with their altered chromatin state (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, bottom). For example, expression of genes that transitioned from the active promoter state to the bivalent or polycomb state (clusters 2 and 4, respectively) was generally reduced upon aging. Conversely, genes showing the opposite transition (cluster 6) or whose polycomb state occupancy was decreased (cluster 5), tended to increase in expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, bottom). We next assessed chromatin state changes at the promoters of all genes showing significant age-specific expression changes in pre-B cells. Promoters of age-upregulated genes showed only subtle changes, with a few notable exceptions, including the newly identified <italic>Let-7b/c2</italic> precursor gene, <italic>Ccnd2</italic> (cyclin D2), and <italic>Mctp1</italic> (multiple C2 and transmembrane domain-containing protein 1). In these cases, the promoter regions switched from a bivalent dominant state in young to a more active state in aged pre-B cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Both <italic>Ccnd2</italic> and <italic>Mctp1</italic> were also assigned to cluster 6 in the genome-wide analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). For genes downregulated in aged pre-B cells, occupancy of the active promoter or active regulatory region state was reduced over 19 of the 32 promoters. Similar to the observation for the majority of upregulated genes, most of these changes were subtle, consistent with the relatively small fold changes in the expression of these genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and the binary nature of chromHMM (at a given genomic location, a peak for a specific chromatin feature is either present or absent). However, we observed substantial changes occurring over the <italic>Irs1</italic> promoter, where the active state transitioned to a bivalent state upon aging (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>); it was also identified in the genome-wide analysis, segregating in cluster 2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>).

We used Hi-C data to segment the genomes into A (active) and B (repressed) compartments using principal component analysis (PCA) combined with H3K4me3 data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This analysis showed that the chromosome compartmentalization was near identical between young and aged pre-B cells. However, 100 out of 9928 regions displayed a significant change in their compartment score upon aging (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> top left; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S11). The compartment score was significantly increased for 40 regions, three of which switched from a repressive B compartment (negative score) to an active A compartment (positive score). Conversely, 60 regions showed a significant decrease in compartment score, with six switching from the A compartment to the B compartment.

PCHi-C enriches for elements that interact with a given promoter (promoter interacting regions [PIRs]), including enhancers and silencers. It also enriches for interactions between promoters, e.g. when they are located in the same transcription factory or share an enhancer. To distinguish such interactions, we analyzed promoter:PIR interactions, where we specifically exclude promoter:promoter interactions, separately from promoter:promoter interactions. Consistent with PCHi-C results in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we observed that PIRs were enriched for features associated with gene regulation including H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). This suggests that many of the detected physical interactions connect promoters with regulatory elements. In both young and aged cells, active promoters frequently interacted with active regulatory regions as well as with other active promoters (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S14a, b), while polycomb-associated and bivalent promoters were enriched for interactions with bivalent promoters and bivalent PIRs, as well as with insulator regions.</p><p id="Par38">We asked how the number and strength of promoter interactions relates to age-specific changes in gene expression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S12).

We then considered changes in the CHiCAGO interaction scores, which give a measure of the confidence with which we detect interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], instead of the binary (present/absent) interaction states. This revealed a general trend towards higher scores at upregulated genes, suggesting stronger or more frequent interactions, and lower scores at downregulated genes, suggesting loss of contacts with regulatory elements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S14c).</p><p id="Par39">We next explored how age-specific changes in gene expression associated with changes in the chromatin state of the PIRs.

Importantly, our global integrative analysis revealed that, while the chromatin landscape of aged B cell precursors was generally similar to that of young cells, changes in chromatin structure and chromosomal conformation frequently accompanied age-specific alterations in gene expression. In addition to changes in protein-coding gene expression, we identified several long non-coding and miRNAs that are differentially regulated between young and aged B cell precursors, and highlighted chromatin alterations that might play a role therein. Thus, modulation of the underlying chromatin likely contributes to transcriptional alterations upon aging and may play a causative role in some of the gene expression changes that we observed. We found differences in the repressive, polycomb-linked histone modification H3K27me3 particularly noteworthy: this modification has the potential to be heritable from one cell generation to the next by regulating the binding of polycomb repressive complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and was broadly increased over age-downregulated genes, while upregulated genes displayed decreased enrichment. These opposing trends indicate that it is unlikely that there is a general change in the machinery that sets or removes H3K27me3; indeed, we did not detect altered expression of polycomb group genes. Rather, these differences are more readily explained by gene-specific alterations, such as in signaling pathways to chromatin or the binding of site-specific transcription factors that, in turn, affect H3K27me3. This is illustrated by our observation that modulation of <italic>Irs1</italic> and <italic>Let-7</italic> gene expression was linked to opposing changes in histone H3K27me3 over proximal regulatory elements at those genes. A previous study demonstrated that in skeletal muscle of rapamycin-treated mice (which develop diabetes-like symptoms), <italic>Irs1</italic> was downregulated together with several other insulin signaling-linked genes through PRC1 recruitment and increased H3K27me3; this repression was dependent on the transcriptional regulator YY1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Consistent with this, the changes in H3K27me3 that we observed in the <italic>Irs1</italic> promoter and the <italic>Let-7b/c2</italic> regulatory region are close to YY1 binding sites. Future work will explore the mechanisms that target H3K27me3 to these genes in pro-B and pre-B cells.</p><p id="Par42">In contrast to the association between gene expression changes and alterations in histone modifications and chromatin accessibility over promoter regions, the chromatin at PIRs was remarkably stable. However, we found that changes in gene expression upon aging were often accompanied by rewiring of the interactions of these promoters with other, potentially regulatory, regions of the genome. Given the absence of chromatin alterations at PIRs, it is conceivable that this rewiring is driven by chromatin modulations at the promoters themselves. Notably, downregulation of genes upon aging was often linked to a loss of promoter interactions, while upregulation was linked to a gain of promoter:promoter interactions. These alterations in specific promoter interactions likely contribute to the shifts that we observed for several DEGs between active and inactive nuclear compartments. Rewiring of promoter interactions has been documented in other systems, especially during differentiation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). Here we reveal this layer of genome regulation in an important new context, aging. Together, these analyses shed light on the multiple complementary layers of gene regulation that affect the aging phenotype in B cell precursors.</p><p id="Par43">Interestingly, there was only a partial overlap in the genes differentially expressed upon aging between the total versus nuclear RNA-seq analyses, with more widespread changes identified in the nuclear transcriptome. This might suggest that aging is accompanied by alterations in nascent transcription of numerous genes, whose levels are then buffered by the cells, e.g. through mechanisms involving RNA stability. On the other hand, genes identified only in the total RNA-seq analysis might be transcribed with the same kinetics in young and aged cells, but differently regulated by mechanisms acting post-transcriptionally. The differential expression of several miRNAs that we observed likely contributes to altered protein abundance upon aging. It will be important to explore the numerous facets of post-transcriptional mechanisms and their potential role in aging.</p><p id="Par44">Aging has been linked to increased heterogeneity at the organismal and cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To minimize confounding effects of heterogeneity in this study, we used pools of healthy mice to normalize for inter-individual variation. The fact that we could robustly detect both an increase of H3K27me3 over the age-downregulated <italic>Irs1</italic> promoter and a decrease of this mark over the <italic>Let-7b/c2</italic>-linked regulatory region supports the notion that the gene expression changes we observe are not due to a few &#x02018;outlier&#x02019; mice and/or cells, because in the latter case a decrease in H3K27me3 would be difficult to observe, as the signal would be diluted out. Conversely, this normalization approach likely masked gene expression changes within individual aged mice, leading to an underestimate of the numbers of genes affected. While we cannot exclude the possibility that there are additional pathways that may be revealed by analysis of individual mice, we believe we have captured dominant pathways that are altered in aging mouse B cell precursors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Precursor B cell aging is associated with gene expression alterations linked to IGF signaling</title><p id="Par45">Our analyses revealed alterations in the IGF signaling pathway at several regulatory levels, suggesting a pivotal contribution to the aging process in B cell precursors.

We also observed decreased IRS1 protein levels in the aged pro- and pre-B cells compared with the young cells, demonstrating that the lower mRNA level leads to a reduction in the amount of IRS1 protein produced. Notably, downregulation of these key players in the IIS and nutrient signaling pathways has been associated with the aging process, as further discussed below.</p><p id="Par46">Several of the differentially expressed miRNAs that we identified have also been linked to insulin/IGF/metabolic signaling.

The majority of HSCs in the bone marrow are not proliferative, in contrast to the pro- and pre-B cells.

In fact, the nutrient- and growth-linked IIS and mTOR pathways are some of the most conserved aging-controlling pathways in evolution, in worms, flies, and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Much of this past work linking IIS to aging is based on gene deletion or mutation analysis. Our work highlights changes in gene expression of these components in normal aging and reveals epigenetic mechanisms that are involved.</p><p id="Par49">B cell development is critically dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment, which is altered upon aging. A decrease in secretion of IL7 by aged stromal cells has been linked to impaired generation of B cells in the bone marrow (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]), which is exacerbated by impaired signaling responses to IL7 in aged pro-B cells. Consistent with reduced IL7-dependent survival and proliferation, we observed reduced numbers of pro-B cells in aged mice. Our data additionally implicate IGF-1 signaling in the aged phenotype of the B cell precursors (see above). Previous work has analyzed the involvement of IGF1R signaling in B cell function, showing that <italic>Igf1r</italic> is the predominantly expressed insulin-family receptor in B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and that IGF-1, secreted by osteoblasts, is required for normal B cell development in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We observed a more profound reduction in pre-B compared to pro-B cell numbers, concomitant with the onset of IGF-1 signaling in the pro-B to pre-B cell transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Notably, <italic>Igf1r</italic> deletion in B cell precursors leads to a similar reduction in numbers as we have observed (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]). It is well established that the IIS pathway is subject to multiple levels of feedback regulation. In particular, post-translational regulation of IRS-1 by serine/threonine protein kinases is thought to promote homeostasis with regard to circulating levels of nutrients and insulin (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]). Our results uncover a further level of control in this pathway, the chromatin reorganization of key genes, such as <italic>Irs1</italic> and <italic>Let-7</italic>. It will therefore be important to establish the upstream triggers for these changes during aging and the extent to which they are cell autonomous or reflect changes in other components of the bone marrow niche of the aged mouse, such as bone architecture, cell composition or secreted levels of IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It will also be important to understand how altered expression of these genes integrates with other central signaling pathways regulating B cell precursor growth, survival, and differentiation. Notably, we did not find alterations in gene expression or epigenetic regulation within these pathways. In particular, we found unaltered expression of the IL7R, consistent with previous studies implicating reduced availability of IL7 and cytoplasmic signaling of the IL7R in the reduction of pro-B cell numbers in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Additionally, we did not detect altered expression of SL components of the pre-BCR. Reduced SL cell surface expression observed in aged precursor B cells has been proposed to be an adaptive response to the aging microenvironment which restricts pre-B cell selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Our data suggest that neither of these pathways is dysregulated at the level of gene expression in aging B cell precursors.</p><p id="Par50">It is noteworthy that <italic>Irs1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice have a longer life- and health-span, with an aged T cell profile that is more comparable to young mice than the control aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and that heterozygous IGF-1R mice (<italic>Igfr1</italic>&#x02212;/+) also show an increased lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that reducing IIS leads to greater resilience against cellular stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], such as proteotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Thus, the precursor B cells that remain in aged mice may be those that have adapted best to altered stress conditions in aging. One might speculate that pre-B cells with lower expression of <italic>Irs1</italic> in the aged mice may be more viable and/or the result of a selection process. This could be because greater stimulation of the IRS1-mediated signaling pathway may render cells more susceptible to age-associated stresses, e.g. proteotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">In addition to the genes related to IGF-1 signaling, we identified other DEGs that have the potential to affect the aged phenotype in B cell precursors.

Based on these learnt parameters, the genomic localization of these states is inferred separately for Young and Aged. For this, first, the genome was binned into 200-bp bins and binarized based on the pre-B cell ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq peaks using the &#x02018;binarizeBed&#x02019; function. We then ran the &#x02018;learnModel&#x02019; function, varying the number of chromatin states in the range of 3&#x02013;24. We chose 16 states as the optimum; these were then manually collapsed into six distinct and more biologically relevant states, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>.</p><p id="Par74">Promoter occupancy for each state (bp) was calculated over a 5-kb window centred on the TSS of each gene; the overall state of a given promoter was assigned to the state with the largest coverage, with the exception of the background state to which a promoter was assigned only if no other state was present. A genome-wide set of regulatory elements was defined by merging the MACS peaks called from ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, and CTCF in pre-B cells; the overall state of each was assigned in the same way as for promoters. States were assigned separately based on young and aged chromatin segmentation, allowing the proportions of promoters and regulatory elements in each state to be compared and to identify regions that changed state upon aging. To assess the overlap of regulatory elements in each state with transcription start sites, all mRNA isoforms (based on Ensembl annotations) were considered; any regulatory element within 1-kb of a transcription start site was considered overlapping. To extend the analysis of promoters, the absolute coverage of all states was considered for each promoter: genes displaying the greatest magnitudes of change in state coverage upon aging (in the top 0.5% for increased or decreased bp coverage for at least one regulatory state, excluding background) were selected and changes in coverage were normalized by subtracting the mean change in bp coverage for a given state. Complete-linkage hierarchical clustering was performed based on the Euclidean distance between the Pearson correlation coefficients between state changes. Genes were segregated into nine clusters to maximize the distinction between state change patterns and the log2 fold change in pre-B cell total gene expression upon aging compared for each cluster. The fraction of the promoter occupied by each state was also calculated for selected age-up- and downregulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Hi-C analysis</title><p id="Par75">We mapped and filtered the Hi-C reads using HiCUP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] and analyzed the filtered Hi-C data using HOMER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Using the binned Hi-C data, we computed the coverage- and distance-related background in the Hi-C data at 250-kb resolution, based on an iterative correction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. The compartment signal was computed as the first principle component of the distance-and-coverage corrected interaction profile correlation matrix at 250-kb resolution, as has previously been described and shown to identify active and inactive compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since PCA does not necessarily assign a positive value to the active compartment, H3K4me3 enrichment in young pre-B cells was compared for positive and negative compartments; positive values were then assigned to the group with high enrichment and vice versa. Genomic 250-kb bins that significantly changed compartment association were identified by ANOVA with a threshold of 0.05 and further filtered to include only bins showing a standardized mean change in compartment score &#x0003e;&#x02009;3. Genes overlapping each bin were identified and the log2 fold change in their expression in aged versus young pre-B cells (total RNA-seq) was compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>PCHi-C analysis</title><p id="Par76">Reads were mapped and filtered using HiCUP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. BAM files for duplicate sequencing lanes were merged and deduplicated, and interactions were called using CHiCAGO&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], using a threshold of 5 for significant interactions. An interaction was designated as lost or gained upon aging if it was significant at only one age and the difference in score was at least 2. Interactions for which both ends were baited were designated promoter:promoter interactions, while all others were designated promoter:PIR. Enrichment for overlap of PIRs with ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq features was performed within the CHiCAGO pipeline, using MACS peaks called from our data as described above; overlaps expected by chance were simulated within the CHiCAGO pipeline using 100 random subsets of <italic>HindIII</italic> fragments with similar interaction distances. Each promoter and PIR was assigned to one of the six chromatin states for the chromHMM analysis as follows: active promoter = fragment overlaps with active promoter state and does not overlap with polycomb or bivalent states; polycomb = fragment overlaps with polycomb state and does not overlap with active promoter or bivalent state; bivalent = fragment overlaps with bivalent state or with both active promoter and polycomb states; active regulatory = fragment overlaps with active regulatory state and does not overlap with active promoter, bivalent or polycomb states; insulator = fragment overlaps with insulator state and does not overlap with any other state except background; background = fragment overlaps exclusively with background state. All active fragments were defined as those assigned to the active promoter or active regulatory state, or with overlapping ChIP-seq peaks of H3K4me3 or H3K27ac, excluding any fragments assigned to the polycomb or bivalent state or that overlapped with an H3K27me3 peak. To compare enrichment of ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq over PIRs, total read counts over the PIRs were normalized to the total library size and the log2 fold change in median read count compared for PIRs of up- and downregulated genes, excluding upregulated genes predicted to originate from mature cells. Genome browser interaction plots were generated using the WashU browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Virtual 4C was performed using Seqmonk to import all ditag reads for which the other end mapped to the baited <italic>HindIII</italic> fragment encompassing the <italic>Irs1</italic> gene promoter. Read counts were quantified over merged <italic>HindIII</italic> fragments, such that each quantitation window comprised five adjacent <italic>HindIII</italic> fragments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Western blot</title><p id="Par77">Pre- and pro-B cell pellets were sonicated in SDS sample buffer and proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE.
