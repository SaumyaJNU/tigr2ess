    "Soil heavy metals pollution is of global concern in view of their flow through the food chain. The convectional, physical, and chemical approaches to remediate polluted soils are usually expensive and not eco-friendly. Phytoextraction is a promising alternative because of the cost effectiveness and eco-friendliness. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the abilities of Chromolaena odorata (Co) and Tithonia diversifolia (Td) to extract heavy metals from polluted soil. Soil analysis was done in part per million (ppm) before Td and Co were grown separately on sixty soil samples of 6.5 kg each collected from 3 selected dumpsites in Irese, New Stadium, and a control site (Ijare), Akure in Ondo State. Three replicates of the soil samples collected from Ijare were simulated with 10 g/kg each of cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) and used in assessing the phytoextraction capabilities of Co and Td. Two grams per kilogram of each of the heavy metals were mixed together and used in simulating three soil samples collected from Ijare and phytoextraction capabilities of Co and Td assessed. A control experiment using soil sample from Ijare was also set up in three replicates for Co and Td. Soil analyses were also carried out after the experiment in ppm. Plant biomass was assessed. Heavy metal contents in roots, shoots and soil samples were analyzed after harvest to determine the bioaccumulation (BF). Data obtained were subjected to one way Analysis of Variance at α0.05. The most contaminated soil sample before and after the experiment was obtained in soil sample (mg/kg) from OD with Cd = 0.08 and 0.071, Zn = 1.92 and 1.85, Fe = 8.44 and 6.94, Cu = 3.04 and 2.54 and Pb = 1.4 and 0.93 respectively. The highest fresh and dry weights (g) for Td and Co were recorded in the plants grown in the control soil. The fresh weight (g) for Td and Co shoots and roots were 110.58 and 52.90; and 48.41 and 7.18 respectively. The dry weights (mg) for Td and Co shoots and roots were 20.56 and 4.68; and 16.66 and 0.36 respectively. Uptake of heavy metals in T. diversifolia and C. odorata tissues (ppm) were Cd (0.43 and 0.06), Zn (6.57 and 3.8), Cu (3.93 and 2.21), Pb (2.37 and 1.94) and Fe (55.15 and 32.82) respectively. This study showed Tithonia diversifolia and C. odorata were capable of reducing heavy metals in polluted soils. Thus the plants are good candidates for the phytoextraction of heavy metals from polluted soils."
