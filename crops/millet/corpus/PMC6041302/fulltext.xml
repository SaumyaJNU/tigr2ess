Furthermore, the phytochemicals extracted from rice husk was identified and its biological activity, including antioxidant activity, cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) and antiproliferative activity, had been detected as well. Results showed the bound fraction of rice husk had higher antioxidant than common fruit and grain. Free fraction of rice husk deserved to have further analysis in antiproliferative activity due to its low cytotoxicity. The CNCs produced by residue was using delignification process and acid hydrolysis treatments. The chemical composition of the residue obtained after phytochemical extraction was determined. CNCs morphological investigation was performed using an optical microscope and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Rice husk is the byproduct of rice milling and the major agro-waste from rice production. World production of rice annually was 741 million tons, and approximately 148 million tons of husks were generated, corresponding to 20% of grain weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, due to their tough structure and huge bulk, rice husk has limited applications and was treated by burying underground or open field burning. Thus, it is of great benefit to both the economy and environment to effectively convert rice husk into valuable products.</p><p id="Par3">Recently researches regarding obtaining higher values from RHs have been investigated, such as deriving bioactive phytochemicals due to its protection against oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The strong link between antioxidant activity and phytochemical especially phenolics had been demonstrated by numerous reports, which indicate that phenolic compounds could be the dominant factor of antioxidant capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, phenolic compounds were found to inhibit the growth of tumor cell lines from human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Several literatures had been reported the <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of rice husk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, none of these researches reported the cellular antioxidant activity of rice husk. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of phytochemical extracted from rice husk was limited.</p><p id="Par4">In addition, agricultural solid residues with high cellulose content have been proposed to use in cellulose and nanocellulose production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that rice husk contains about 35&#x02013;40% cellulose, 15&#x02013;20% hemicellulose, and 20&#x02013;25% lignin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hence, another way to take advantage of rice husk includes the utilization of the cellulose section. Johar <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> had successfully produced cellulose fibers and nanocrystals from rice husk using an acid hydrolysis treatment. CNCs has attracted a great deal of attention for its wide application, including reinforced nanocomposites, optically transparent functional materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, their use in films, membranes, catalyst support materials, and functionalized drug carriers has being explored recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the study of Wijaya <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, CNC was extracted from passionfruit peels and used as tetracycline antibiotic drug carrier. Therefore, the use of rice husk as the primary source for producing cellulose nanocrystals is promising.</p><p id="Par5">Thus, the objective of this study was to introduce a comprehensive approach to utilize rice husk by deriving phytochemicals primarily and gaining CNCs from residue. Moreover, phenolic compounds, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities were evaluated and morphological investigation of the CNCs was conducted. Through this method, phytochemical extracted from rice husk can be a potential ingredient in antioxidants or anticancer products. And the CNC made from the residue can be applied to other areas that generate economic value such as reinforcement materials and drug carriers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of Rice Husk</title><p id="Par6">The contents of phenolic and flavonoid of rice husk were presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.
