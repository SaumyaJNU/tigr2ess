    "The present study investigated the phenolic profiles and antioxidant properties of different fractions from Prinsepia utilis Royle fruits using molecular docking analysis to delineate their inhibition toward digestive enzymes. A total of 20 phenolics was identified and quantified. Rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside were the major phenolic compounds in the total phenolic fraction and flavonoid-rich fraction. The anthocyanin-rich fraction mainly contained cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. All of the fractions exhibited strong radical scavenging activities and good inhibition on cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in H₂O₂-induced HepG2 cells, as evaluated by DPPH and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays. Moreover, the powerful inhibitory effects of those fractions against pancreatic lipase and α-glucosidase were observed. The major phenolic compounds that were found in the three fractions also showed good digestive enzyme inhibitory activities in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking analysis revealed the underlying inhibition mechanisms of those phenolic standards against digestive enzymes, and the theoretical analysis data were consistent with the experimental results."
