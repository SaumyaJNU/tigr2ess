By analyzing mitochondrial DNA sequences of an extensive sample set spanning 10,000 years, we find that the earliest pigs from the middle Yellow River region already carried the maternal lineages that are dominant in both younger archaeological populations and modern Chinese pigs. Our data set also supports early Neolithic pig utilization and a long-term <italic>in situ</italic> origin for northeastern Chinese pigs during 8,000&#x02013;3,500 BP, suggesting a possibly independent domestication in northeast China. Additionally, we observe a genetic replacement in ancient northeast Chinese pigs since 3,500 BP. The results not only provide increasing evidence for pig origin in the middle Yellow River region but also depict an outline for the process of early pig domestication in northeast China.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It is widely accepted that pigs were domesticated independently in Near East and East Asia beginning ~10,000 years ago after <italic>Sus sp</italic>. emerged in Southeast Asia during the climatic fluctuations of the early Pliocene 5.3&#x02013;3.5&#x02009;My ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. So far, at least six phylogeographically distinct wild boar lineages have been found to have contributed to the present domestic pig populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Over the past decade, regions in China, including the Mekong River basin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, the downstream region of the Yangtze River<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, the upper stream region of the Yangtze River<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the Tibetan highlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and the lower region of the Yellow River<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> have been suggested as regions from which wild boar have contributed to the domestic pig gene pool and which may have represented independent centers for pig domestication.</p><p id="Par3">Zoo-archaeological studies on the pig remains from the Early Neolithic assemblages in China back this idea of multiregional pig domestication in East Asia. The faunal assemblages of the ~9,000-y-old Zhenpiyan cave site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> in Guangxi province and the ~8,000-y-old Kuahuqiao site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> in Zhejiang Province both provide evidence for a commensal domestication phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> in the Mekong River basin and the downstream region of Yangtze River. Furthermore, numerous pig remains excavated in the ~10,500-y-old Nanzhuangtou site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the ~9,000-y-old Jiahu site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the ~7,500-y-old Cishan site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> as well as palaeogenetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> presented the middle and lower branches of the Yellow River as one of the earliest regions for pig domestication. Extensive archaeological findings in these regions, such as broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, dog and chicken, are evidence for early origins of mixed agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Besides the archaeological findings, pigs seem to have had cultural significance for the communities in this region because two pig skeletons were buried with humans at Xinglongwa Site (8,200&#x02013;7,400 BP), implying either that pigs may already have been domesticated in Northeast China around 8,000 years ago or that wild boar had cultural significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It has previously been shown that, at least with regard to maternal lineages, Chinese native pig breeds were direct descendants of the first domesticated pigs in the corresponding geographical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, it is likely that roaming in a semi-managed status during the beginning of domestication allowed recurrent genetic exchange between domesticated pigs and indigenous wild boars. Thus, even during the beginning of domestication, genetic similarity between domestic pigs and wild boar from the same region may indicate introgression of wild boar haplotypes into the domestic gene pool rather than independent domestication events. Moreover, human migrations and cultural expansions repeatedly took place in East Asia during the past 10,000 years. Thus, human-mediated dispersal of and gene flow among domestic pig populations would not have been uncommon. Both for European and Near Eastern pigs, ancient DNA and dental geometric morphometric analyses have revealed nonlinear patterns of early domestication, dispersal of animals, genetic turnover and interaction among various geographic regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We have collected pig remains from 15 archaeological sites in China, including Jiahu and another two of the oldest archaeological sites in the middle Yellow River basin (Nanzhuangtou and Cishan), three sites in Northeast China (Xinglongwa, Wanfabozi and Dashanqian), and one site (Changning) in the upper region of the Yellow River.

In contrast, the fourth dominant haplotype, H10, which is found in ~25% of modern Chinese pigs, was detected only around 4,500 years ago in several sites across China within our data set (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Other contemporaneous haplotypes H70, H72 and H73 were generally detected almost exclusively in ancient pigs, except H70, which we found in one modern pig (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These three rare haplotypes are genetically close to the dominant haplotypes H2 or H10, separated by only one or two SNPs. A similar picture arises in Northeast China, where the ~4,000&#x02009;y old haplotypes H31 and H71 were found, which are close to H2 and H10, respectively. While we did not find H71 in modern pigs, H31 interestingly appeared in two modern wild populations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Moreover, the 8,000&#x02013;7,400 years old remains in Northeast China carried not only the dominant haplotype H4 but also the less dominant haplotype H18. Even though H18 was never found in modern samples from Northeast China, it was detected in a younger sample (4,000 BP) from Wadian from the middle Yellow River region and at ~2.4% in modern pig populations in southern China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Finally, for the ~4,000 year old samples from the upper region of the Yellow River and the middle region of the Yangtze River, we found that they shared similar haplotype compositions with ancient pigs in the middle Yellow River basin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Overall, after their first appearance in the middle region of the Yellow River and Northeast China, most of the oldest haplotypes were inherited into younger times up to modern Chinese pigs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Temporal transition of mtDNA control region haplotypes of ancient Chinese pigs in different regions.

In our data set of mitochondrial DNA sequences from ancient Chinese pigs, we found both considerable differences in haplotype composition over time and long-term continuity of some haplotypes.</p><p id="Par13">The middle Yellow River basin has long been discussed as one center for early Chinese pig domestication based on both ancient DNA and morphometric evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Already the earliest pig remains from this region revealed the haplotypes that represent the dominant maternal lineages in modern Chinese pigs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the middle Yellow River basin indeed was one of the earliest centers for pig domestication from where domestic pigs spread to other regions in China. In a previous study, we demonstrated maternal lineage continuity in pigs from between ~9,000-y-old remains in the middle and ~4,000-y-old ones in the upper region of the Yellow River<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The present results from two samples from Changning in the upper region of the Yellow River further support this interpretation. Moreover, isotope data from Dadiwan in the upper Yellow River region provided evidence for a cultural replacement by central Chinese Neolithic cultures before 4,000 BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting a possible reason why the ~4,000 BP pigs in the upper Yellow River region could have originated from progenitors from the middle Yellow River region. Similar to our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, additional samples from Qinglongquan in the middle Yangtze River region also carry the dominant haplotypes that were already found in ~10,000 BP samples from the middle Yellow River drainage, suggesting a possible southward migration before (or around) ~4,000 year ago.</p><p id="Par14">Due to close relationships between humans and pigs and evidence of early millet farming at Xinglongwa, Northeast China has been proposed as another region of early pig domestication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, only pig remains younger than 8,000 BP are assumed to represent domesticated ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the present study, Xinglongwa specimens carry the dominant modern haplotype H4 and the less common haplotype H18, respectively, demonstrating maternal continuity between the earliest archaeological pig remains in this region and modern Chinese domestic pigs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The haplotype H4 also appears in Jiahu and Cishan around the same time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting either early population migrations, trade of early domestic pigs or parallel domestication across the North China Plain and Northeast China. <italic>Suidae</italic> remains in Xinglongwa were found in all three cultural phases (8,200&#x02013;8,000 BP, 8,000&#x02013;7,400 BP and 7,400&#x02013;7,000 BP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting continuous utilization of pigs during the early Neolithic in this region. The younger haplotypes H31 and H71 discovered in Northeast China (Wanfabozi and Dashanqian) have so far not been found in the middle Yellow River region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), implying also long-term <italic>in situ</italic> continuity after initial pig domestication, or possibly, introgression of wild boar haplotypes into imported, early domestic pig herds, in Northeast China.</p><p id="Par15">In addition to long-term continuity, we also observed genetic turnovers in ancient Northeast Chinese pigs. One example is haplotype H18, which we found in a ~7,500 year old sample from Xinglongwa, but which seems to have disappeared afterwards in Northeast China. However, we found it in younger samples from the middle Yellow River region ~4,000 BP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and also in modern pigs from southern China. In contrast, the rare haplotype H71, which we found in a single ~3,500 year old sample from Northeast China has not yet been found in modern pigs (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), indicating that genetic drift also played a role in the history of domestic pigs during the last 3,500 BP. This view is further supported by haplotypes H72 and H73, which are both from the ~4,000 BP Guchengzhai site in the middle Yellow River Region and have not been found in any younger sites or modern pigs so far.</p><p id="Par16">The last pattern was found for haplotype H31 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), which we discovered only in one 4,000&#x02013;5,000 year old sample from Northeast China and in two wild boar from southern China. In contrast to past pig populations, modern pigs in Northeast China show a similar mitochondrial haplotype composition as other regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), suggesting extensive homogenization of pig populations over time, accompanied by a loss of at least some of the original, regional maternal lineages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par17">Our results support early independent domestication and long-term genetic continuity of pigs both in Europe and East Asia. The earliest pigs from the middle Yellow River region already carried the maternal lineages that are dominant in both younger archaeological populations and modern Chinese pigs. Moreover, there is strong evidence for early Neolithic pig utilization and possibly independent domestication, or alternatively, incorporation of local wild boar into introduced domestic pig populations in northeast China. However, this <italic>in situ</italic> origin for northeastern Chinese pigs ended around 3,500 BP due to genetic replacement, likely by pigs originating from the middle Yellow River region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample Information</title><p id="Par18">We used ninety-three ancient pig specimens (bones or teeth) for DNA analyses, which originate from 15 archaeological sites in northern and central China (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), including 65 specimens from nine sites in the lower and middle area of the Yellow River drainage basin (Nanzhuangtou and Cishan sites in Hebei province; Jiahu, Nanwa, Guchengzhai, Wadian and Wangchenggang sites in Henan province; Taosi and Gaohong sites in Shanxi province), 6 specimens from two sites located in the upper region of the Yellow River (Lajia and Changning sites in Qinghai province), 12 specimens from one site (Qinglongquan site in Hubei province) located in the middle region of the Yangtze River, and 10 specimens from three sites in Northeast China (Xinglongwa and Dashanqian sites in eastern Inner Mongolia and Wangfabozi site in Jilin province).
