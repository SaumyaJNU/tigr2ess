    "We present a rare case of generalized fixed drug eruption caused by fluconazole. A 45-year-old female patient was referred to our outpatient clinic because of suspicious drug eruptions that occurred 5 months earlier and resolved within a month. The patient had sequela of hyperpigmentation on her arms, legs, back, and abdomen after oral administration of the fourth dose of 150 mg of fluconazole once daily because of vaginal candidiasis. Patch tests with the culprit drug applied both on unaffected skin areas and over one of the lesions were negative. A lymphocyte transformation test was performed and in response to fluconazole, CD4+ T cells significantly proliferated. Because the patient needed a safe antifungal drug for her recurrent vaginal candidiasis symptoms, a single-blind placebo-controlled drug provocation test was performed with itraconazole and was negative. Accordingly, 200 mg of itraconazole once daily was given for 10 days safely."
