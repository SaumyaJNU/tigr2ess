    "Context:Mutations in genes encoding the lipoprotein lipase enzyme, its cofactor, or transport proteins can cause severe familial hypertriglyceridemia, resulting in serious complications, such as severe pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lipid encephalopathy, and failure to thrive. Current treatment includes a low-saturated-fat formula enriched with high medium-chain triglyceride (TGs), oral fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or plasmapheresis. Case Description:A 71-day-old infant with very severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis associated with a likely pathogenic variant in the LPL gene was treated successfully with insulin infusion and a locally prepared low-fat formula feed after stopping breast milk. Subcutaneous insulin was administered daily from 9 to 30 months of age. His serum TG level was markedly lower, although higher than normal. No episodes of hypoglycemia were noted. Fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acids were ineffective in this infant. At the last follow-up visit, he was 36 months old and growing normally. He was consuming a special meal plan and receiving insulin injections during high-fat meals. Two other young infants with severe hypertriglyceridemia were growing normally after a short course of insulin infusion and the same modified reduced long chain fat diet. Conclusions:Insulin is an unusual and affordable therapeutic option for some patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and can be helpful in the prevention of acute and chronic complications. Locally available cereals and millets with high crude fiber and a low glycemic index, along with medium chain TGs, was used to prepare an economical special formula at home to maintain TG concentrations in the acceptable limits."
