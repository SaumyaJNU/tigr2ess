    "OBJECTIVE:This study was aimed at determining the magnitude of prenatal iodine deficiency and its determinants among women attending antenatal care clinic at the University of Gondar Specialized Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 13 to April 25/2017. Precisely, 378 pregnant women were included in the study selected via systematic random sampling technique. Urinary Iodine concentration was determined through spectrophotometer using Sandell-Kolthoff reaction. Iodine deficiency was defined as women having urinary iodine concentration of < 150 µg/L. Moreover, stool examination was done. RESULTS:Subclinical iodine deficiency among pregnant women was 60.5% (95% CI 55%, 65.5%). The Median iodine concentration was 137 μg/L (IQR 80 μg/L). Being governmental employee [AOR = 0.42 (95% CI 0.1 = 20, 0.87)], cabbage consumption of twice or more times per week [AOR = 2.35 (95% CI 1.44, 3.82)], not consuming maize in the last 1 week [AOR = 0.29 (95% CI 0.18, 0.48)], poor household wealth status [AOR = 2.7 (95% CI 1.24, 5.89)], and second trimester of pregnancy [AOR = 2.43 (95% CI 1.37, 4.32)] were significantly associated with iodine deficiency. Prenatal iodine deficiency was high, which deemed a mild public Health problem. Therefore, improving household income, and nutrition education to minimize maize and cabbage consumption are recommended."
