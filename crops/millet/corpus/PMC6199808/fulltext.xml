(2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14), is the only diploid cultivated species of wheat. It is considered one of the oldest crops, as it was domesticated around 9500&#x000a0;years ago, and it influenced the Neolithic Revolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For centuries, domesticated einkorn was largely used as both food and animal fodder in various areas, including the Middle East, the Balkans, the Caucasus, South Africa, and Central and Mediterranean Europe. Starting in the Bronze Age, it was gradually replaced by free-threshing cultivated polyploid durum and bread wheats. Due to its long cultivation history in various geographical and environmental areas <italic>T. monococcum</italic> is still considered an important genomic resource for the improvement of modern wheat, especially for resistance genes against various biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the last decade, it has received interest as a health food because einkorn grains contain significantly more carotenoids, lutein and other nutritional substances than modern wheats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">The diploid nature of <italic>T. monococcum</italic> and its smaller genome size (~&#x02009;5.7&#x000a0;GB), together with its easy cultivation procedure, make this species an attractive and useful model for understanding the biology, genomics and proteomics of <italic>Triticeae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The A<sup>m</sup> genome of domesticated einkorn <italic>T. monococcum</italic> is closely related to the A<sup>u</sup> genome of the wild einkorn <italic>T. urartu</italic>, the diploid donor of the A genome of the hexaploid (AABBDD) bread wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic>), which is currently the main cultivated wheat in the world. The large genome of bread wheat (approximately 17&#x000a0;GB), the presence of three closely related subgenomes with various inter-chromosome translocations and the high repeat contents have made modern wheat a more &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; crop for breeding among cereals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Comparative genomics and combinations of genomic resources from einkorn and other cultivated wheats can help discover new alleles and accelerate advancements in genome-based breeding of modern wheat.</p><p id="Par15">Several modern biotechnological tools, including next-generation sequencing, quantitative trait loci, microarrays, transgenesis and genome editing, can be used to unlock the genomics of <italic>Triticeae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The function of genes in wheat has often been studied in model transgenic plants such as arabidopsis, tobacco and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar studies on modern polyploid wheats faced many problems associated with variable transgene integration into the A, B, and D subgenomes, leading to complexities for transgene performance, frequent gene silencing and unstable expression in subsequent generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Considering the biologically similar properties of <italic>T. monococcum</italic> and other <italic>Triticeae</italic> species, domesticated einkorn provides an excellent opportunity to facilitate the functional characterization of genes in wheat using various transgenic approaches such as overexpression and down-regulation of endogenous genes using RNAi technology or gene editing. Genome editing technologies, in combination with transgenesis, could be used to mutate certain loci and generate several mutants. This can help facilitate the discovery of new genes and clarify the biological processes at the molecular and phenotypic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Despite the substantial progress in biotechnological advancements for many cereals including hexaploid and tetraploid wheats, einkorn is still a recalcitrant monocotyledonous species for transgenesis. In the mid-1990s, several attempts were made to transfer foreign genes into the einkorn genome. Cultured cells of <italic>T. monococcum</italic> were the first of the <italic>Triticeae</italic> species that were used to demonstrate the successful direct gene transfer using a PEG-mediated approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Later, transient gene expression in einkorn cells was achieved using electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and biolistic-mediated gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although stably transformed einkorn cells were obtained using both electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and PEG-mediated delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], no transgenic plants were produced due to the lack of regeneration from protoplasts and cell suspensions. However, the routine application of genetic engineering methods for various scientific purposes is still hampered by the lack of available and highly efficient tissue culture systems in einkorn.</p><p id="Par18">By using immature embryos as explants, we recently established an efficient plant regeneration protocol for domesticated einkorn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The proper combination of plant growth regulators promoted the formation of embryogenic/morphogenic structures with a high frequency (90%) and more than 10 shoots per initial explant. Such efficacy is generally considered sufficient for research aiming to produce transgenic plants from cereal explants. The objective of the study reported here was to establish a protocol for incorporating transgenes into the einkorn genome using biolistic methods and to generate transgenic einkorn plants based on the previously developed regeneration protocol.</p><p id="Par19">Particle bombardment is a simple, versatile and efficient way to achieve genetic transformation in <italic>Triticeae</italic>, especially in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is also considered a more promising method for genome editing in wheat than are PEG- or agrobacterium-mediated approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since the bombardment parameters are species- and tissue-specific, the main objectives of this study were to adjust the physical and biological factors that influence the gene delivery into einkorn cells based on transient gene expression. Here, we report the optimization of biolistic delivery using a plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein gene. Since GFP is a non-destructive reporter system, it allows easy monitoring of both transient expression and the stable transformation events throughout all in vitro experimental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In wheat, the GFP-based reporter system also significantly simplifies the analysis of the promoter specific transgene expression in tissues of mature plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], efficiently documents the inheritance of introduced genes to progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and provides the simple determination of transgene flow between cultivated GM and non-GM plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In this study, we describe the genetic transformation of einkorn based on the strategy of dual selection. In addition to the <italic>gfp</italic> gene, the introduced construct contains the selectable <italic>bar</italic> gene, which confers resistance to phosphinotricin (PPT), the active ingredient of glufosinate ammonium-based commercial herbicides. In wheat biotechnology, the <italic>bar</italic> gene is most commonly used for the production of transgenic plants compared to other selectable genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study and using this dual system (GFP&#x02009;+&#x02009;PPT), it was possible to obtain transgenic einkorn plants displaying the stable expression of foreign genes in various tissues and to confirm the transmission of the introduced genes into subsequent generations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par21">A spring type of einkorn (<italic>T. monococcum</italic> L. ssp. monococcum L.), accession number PI 119435, kindly donated by Prof. Gennady I.

It was evident that &#x02018;medium sized&#x02019; particles of 0.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m were more effective in the transient delivery of the plasmid into einkorn cells than were bigger or smaller ones. It is noteworthy that this trend was observed for morphogenic einkorn tissues of different developmental stages. Generally, the beneficial effect of smaller particle size on transformation efficiency is attributed to less sustained damage being inflicted on bombarded cells than by the larger ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The observation that larger microprojecticles are more effective for plasmid delivery into cells compared to smaller and &#x02018;lighter&#x02019; projectiles is attributed to the achievement of the appropriate kinetic energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Considering the large number of published reports on biolistic transformation, it is not surprising that somewhat controversial data could be found, even for the same species. In polyploid wheats, a species closely related to einkorn, the most effective particle size for plasmid delivery was in the range of 0.6&#x02013;1.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. A comparative study of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] higher transient expression observed polyploid wheat explants being bombarded with 1.0&#x000a0;mm particles. Micro-carriers of this size, both gold and tungsten, were used repeatedly for successful generation of transgenic wheat plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In reports on plants similar to einkorn, the use of a &#x02018;lighter&#x02019; particle size (0.6&#x02013;0.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) resulted in a significant increase in transient/stable wheat transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and has been used in various studies to introduce various foreign genes into the bread wheat genome. In some cases, the size of the microcarriers did not have a significant effect on the biolistic delivery of DNA into wheat explants, so a mixture of particles of different sizes was recommended as the best approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The successful survival of the bombarded explants is a serious problem in obtaining transgenic plants since the apparent repression of regeneration processes occurs after penetration of microcarriers into cells, especially when the tungsten particles were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For this reason, the optimum stage of explant development is another important factor that, similar to helium pressure and particle size, influences ability of microcarriers to penetrate the cell wall without damaging target tissues and can determine the possibility to retain regeneration potential.</p><p id="Par47">In einkorn, scutellar tissues that were cultured for short times on induction medium were not optimal targets because of the lower number of cells were susceptible to biolistic DNA delivery. These explants seemed to be more damaged after bombardment and displayed clear reduction in morphogenic ability. In contrast, einkorn explants cultivated for longer periods of time on the callus induction medium were more susceptible to plasmid delivery and more resistant to remote effects of particle penetration. Due to the formation of early morphogenic structures before bombardment, these explants were still able to produce many regenerable clusters after particle delivery. Nonetheless, the realization of the morphogenic potential of einkorn explants was still problematic in subsequent subcultures and further optimisation work is required.</p><p id="Par48">In the preliminary experiments, when transformed/untransformed cells were subjected to selection stress by a range of PPT concentrations (1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mg/l), significant browning and death of both transgenic and non-transgenic structures were observed. This blocked the process of morphogenesis and plant regeneration, including tissues that demonstrated stable GFP expression. Because the high morphogenic competence in cultivated einkorn tissues highly correlated with a suitable content of three phytohormones of various biological activity (Dicamba+TDZ&#x02009;+&#x02009;Daminozide), we supposed that the addition of PPT had a supplemental toxic effect due to the interaction with one of the substances. Two strategies are studied here to overcome this problem: the modification of the induction medium by reducing the TDZ level and the removal of Daminozide from the selection medium. Additionally, a relatively low PPT concentration (3&#x000a0;mg/l) was used for tissue selection.</p><p id="Par49">Previously, we found that an excessive concentration of Daminozide, which is widely used in agriculture as a plant growth retardant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], negatively influenced the plant regeneration in the tissue culture of bread wheat and einkorn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Given this experience, we assumed that its removal from the selection medium could benefit plantlet development. However, this approach did not improve the formation of the plants from transgenic morphogenic clusters of einkorn. A positive effect on the survival of transgenic morphogenic clusters was found after a significant reduction of the TDZ level in the induction medium followed by its complete removal from the selection medium. With this approach, most of the transgenic einkorn plants were produced. It should be noted that some browning of einkorn explants was earlier observed under nonselective conditions, especially when higher concentrations of TDZ were used to stimulate a morphogenic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is concluded that the difficulty in recovering transformed plants in einkorn was related to the remote toxic effect of TDZ during PPT selection. This observation can be attributed to several aspects of the complex nature of TDZ activity, which was originally developed as a cotton defoliant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is well documented that TDZ activity is very persistent in cultured tissues, even after the removal of this cytokinin-like substance from the medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Since the system for plant regeneration in einkorn is significantly different from other known methods described in the literature for cereals, further media manipulation with various cytokinin-like substances can be considered an important variable for the successful control of transgenic plant regeneration.</p><p id="Par50">In different cereal and grass species, the PPT-based resistance conferred by the <italic>bar</italic> gene was shown to be more effective for the recovery of stable transgenic plants than were other selectable marker genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In Triticeae species, the inefficient elimination of untransformed events was a common problem for PPT selection. In rye, when PPT was applied during the callus selection stage, the suppression of shoot and root regeneration was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Transformation of bread and durum wheats also largely suffered from a high frequency of PPT-resistant escapes (30&#x02013;90%) in those studies, where high concentrations (5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg/l) were used for selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In barley, approximately 4&#x02013;50% of the surviving plants were identified as escapes using moderate concentrations of PPT-based selective agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Unlike the abovementioned species, the attempts to obtain PPT-resistant transgenic plants of sorghum failed because of high phenolic release by sorghum tissues in early stage of regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In einkorn, the relatively low selective pressure of PPT allowed the generation of transgenic plants with a frequency of 0.38&#x02013;0.68% but did not completely prevent the formation of untransformed escapes. Nevertheless, the observed escape rate (~&#x02009;33%) is comparable to those of previous investigations involving various elite varieties of bread and durum wheat, which are closely related species. Considering the drawbacks of using PPT in this study, an alternative selection scheme that includes antibiotic resistance or substrate analogues as selective agents must be further analysed to enhance the success of genetic transformation in einkorn.</p><p id="Par51">The transgenic events of einkorn produced fertile plants that expressed both the <italic>bar</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> genes and successfully transmitted the introduced sequences to T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> progenies. Our results indicate that <italic>gfp</italic> gene was a reliable indicator for controlling genetic transformation of einkorn. At various stages, GFP expression was easily detected in einkorn tissues and organs with low amounts of chlorophyll such as cells, calli, plantlets, roots, pollen grains, embryos and germinating seeds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). Additionally, it was very helpful in identifying transgenic progeny after the self-pollination of transgenic plants.</p><p id="Par52">Both Mendelian and non-Mendelian segregation patterns of the transgenes in the einkorn transgenic lines were observed. One event showed no significant deviation from Mendelian 3:1 ratio (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It is noteworthy that the number of transgenic inserts in this event (as estimated from Southern blot) was greater than one (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), indicating that these copies were integrated into one locus. Other transgenic events displayed distorted ratios of transgene expression close to 1:1 (transgenic/non-transgenic). Similar non-Mendelian fashion of transgene segregation has been frequently observed in the progeny of transgenic cereals produced either by particle bombardment or <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. Several hypotheses were proposed to explain this phenomenon. There was a suggestion that the 1:1 segregation ratio could be due to aberrant gamete development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The lack of fit to expected segregation ratios may be due to factors such as transgene silencing, position effects, multiple transgene copies, DNA rearrangements, promoter methylation and genetic chimerism of the tissues produced in the primary transgenic plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Since both T<sub>0</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x02009;T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x02009;T<sub>2</sub> progenies displayed the same 1:1 ratio of transgene inheritance, chimerism can hardly be considered a possible reason for non-Mendelian segregation. Because all of the independent transgenic events of einkorn yielded more than one insertion of transgene, further analysis is required to determine the mechanism responsible for segregation distortion. Despite the unpredictable correlation between the numbers of inserts and patterns of transgene inheritance, the biolistic-mediated approach described here allowed us to obtain fertile T<sub>2</sub> homozygous populations of einkorn. The developed plants displayed both good transmission of <italic>bar/gfp</italic> transgenes and reliable resistance to herbicide treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">This is the first study to describe the successful production of transgenic plants in einkorn (<italic>Triticum monococcum</italic> L.), a recalcitrant diploid wheat species. Although the transformation efficiency calculated from transgenic event-producing experiments were approximately 0.5%, it is applicable for introducing transgenes into the einkorn genome for practical interests. This efficiency is lower than those reported in the most successful biolistic transformation studies for certain elite varieties of other <italic>Triticeae</italic> species such as barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], but it is comparable with the transformation efficiency of rye and durum wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The results presented here indicate that the low plant transformation frequency in einkorn is not due to inability to stably transform the cultured morphogenic tissues but the difficulty in regenerating transformed plants during selection. Considering that the initial frequency of transformation in many pilot biolistic transformation studies of polyploid wheat also fluctuated by approximately 0.01&#x02013;1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], further examination of additional factors is expected to result in the more efficient production of transgenic einkorn events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
