The investments required for performing in endurance exercise are nevertheless considerable, and passion for their sport might explain the efforts endurance athletes are willing to make. Passion may be defined as a strong motivational force and as such might be related to the neurophysiological basis underlying the drive to exercise. A complex relationship between the brain and other systems is responsible for athletes' exercise behavior and thus performance in sports. We anticipate important consequences of athletes' short term choices, for example concerning risk taking actions, on long term outcomes, such as injuries, overtraining and burnout. We propose to consider athletes' type of passion, in combination with neurophysiological parameters, as an explanatory factor inunderstanding the apparent disparity in the regulation of exercise intensity during endurance sports. Previous research has demonstrated that athletes can be passionate toward their sport in either a harmonious or an obsessive way. Although both lead to considerable investments and therefore often to successful performances, obsessive passion may affect athlete well-being and performance on the long run, due to the corresponding inflexible exercise behavior. In this perspective we will thus examine the influence of passion in sport on athletes' short term and long term decision-making and exercise behavior, in particular related to the regulation of exercise intensity, and discuss the expected long term effects of both types of passion for sport.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>regulation of exercise intensity</kwd><kwd>exercise behavior</kwd><kwd>psychobiology</kwd><kwd>overtraining</kwd><kwd>burnout</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="6"/><word-count count="4681"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Elite athletes continuously train and compete at the limits of their physiological and psychological capacities, and their training and competitive schedules are more demanding than ever (Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Passion for their sport might be the motivational force or &#x0201c;drive&#x0201d; providing these athletes with the required energy and determination to exercise, and might explain their willingness to endure discomfort (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and even pain (Mauger, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), for the sake of sports performance (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Pushing themselves to continuously sustain maximal effort over a long period of time might nevertheless entail several risks for passionate athletes, such as overtraining and injuries (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). We therefore propose that studying the nature of passion for sports might shed a light on athletes' exercise behavior (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and subsequent risks.</p><p>In cyclic middle and long-distance exercise, athletes need to adequately estimate their physiological capacity and regulate exercise accordingly during training and races, in order to perform optimally (Foster et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Abbiss and Laursen, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). As it represents a strong motivational force (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), passion might be a key factor in explaining their subsequent exercise behavior, both within a race and throughout the competitive season, derived from complex interactions between factors either promoting or reducing their drive to exercise (McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>In this perspective, we will address athletes' exercise behavior and pacing by examining the impact of passion on the regulation of exercise intensity and exercise behavior from a psychological and a physiological angle. Adopting a psychophysiological approach to study the drive to exercise might elucidate athletes' pacing both on the short (during a single exercise bout or race) and long (a season or even an athletes' career) term and allow the examination of subsequent outcomes, such as athlete performance and well-being (McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Passion in sports according to psychology</title><p>In the field of psychology, varying definitions of motivation have been proposed, most of which consider motivation as a combination of internal and/or external stimuli, pushing people to act or to react (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In sports, motivation is used to describe the initiation, direction, intensity, and persistence of behavior (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), in short; the &#x0201c;drive&#x0201d; to exercise. Passion is defined as a &#x0201c;particularly strong motivation toward a self-defining activity,&#x0201d; and thus might be a useful construct to understand athletes' &#x0201c;drive&#x0201d; to exercise (Vallerand, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As this drive seems imperative to sustain effort during endurance sports, notably at the elite level (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), understanding athletes' passion for sport might thus elucidate athletes' willingness to engage in demanding endurance exercise (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The Dualistic Model of Passion proposed by Vallerand introduces passion as a key element in the long-term outcomes of engagement in activities (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). By considering two distinct types of passion, namely harmonious and obsessive passion, this model explains apparent disparity in athletes' exercise behavior (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>For athletes to develop a passion for their sport, they must highly value their activity, which distinguishes passion from both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation which can exist in different degrees from &#x0201c;not at all motivated&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;highly motivated&#x0201d; (Mageau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In accordance with Self-Determination Theory, different reasons for engaging in an activity might lead to different outcomes resulting from the two different types of passion (Ryan and Deci, <xref rid="B31a" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Autonomous reasons, such as the inherent pleasure an activity brings, are known to lead to intrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci, <xref rid="B31a" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). If the given activity becomes part of athlete's identity, a harmonious passion can result (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). When athletes feel obliged to practice, or if the activity serves important compensatory or external functions, this will lead to a more extrinsic form of motivation, and, in time, can result in an obsessive passion (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>Passion and its resulting strong motivation are an essential prerequisite to attain and maintain the highest level in elite sport (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A harmonious passion results from engaging repeatedly in an activity that provides athletes with positive emotional experiences, such as joy, feelings of mastery and high levels of concentration (Mageau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Harmoniously passionate athletes feel free and autonomous in their choice to engage in their activity, and can maintain a healthy balance between their sport and other important life domains (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Those with an obsessive passion for their sport perceive an unstoppable urge to practice, for example because their self-esteem relies on their athletic performance (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Obsessive athletes feel they have no choice but to invest maximally in their activity: their passion has come to control their exercise behavior (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which may lead to negative emotions (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The nature of athletes' passion therefore influences decision making before and during exercise as well as throughout the competitive season (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Hence, understanding athletes' passion might (partially) elucidate their exercise behavior and the resulting benefits and drawbacks throughout the competitive season (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Passion in sports according to physiology: a neurophysiological perspective underlying the drive to exercise</title><p>The nature of athletes' passion, and thus of their drive to exercise, might represent one of the many factors influencing exercise behavior. In past research, the regulation of this drive to sustain exercise has been examined from a neurophysiological angle (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It has been found that neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, noradrenalin and serotonin, can maintain or decrease arousal and motivation to continue physical effort (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Modifications in the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters can influence the regulation of athletes' power output and central fatigue and hence influence exercise performance (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Dopamine for example is known to play an important role in motivation, reward, attention, addiction, control of voluntary movement and locomotion (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). An increase in dopamine was found to enhance motivation toward rewarding goals in prolonged exercise, resulting in improved performance (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>). Noradrenaline on the other hand is associated with the regulation of attention, arousal, anxiety, pain, mood, and depression (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Increasing its concentrations resulted in decreased time trial performance (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008b</xref>). Although no effects of serotonin level manipulations on performance could be demonstrated, high serotonin levels appear to inhibit athletes' ability and motivation to perform an end sprint during exercise (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>In short, manipulations of brain dopamine or noradrenaline concentrations may delay fatigue, or on the contrary deteriorate performance in the heat (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Neurotransmitters thus might be considered as indispensable mediators between the drive to exercise and actual behavior, leading to adjustments in energy expenditure and effort exerted (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Regulation of exercise intensity and endurance performance</title><p>The goal-directed regulation of exercise intensity over an exercise bout in which athletes need to decide how and when to invest their energy has been defined as pacing (Smits et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and its outcome can be measured as athletes' power output or velocity profile during exercise (de Koning et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Foster et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In order to perform optimally, athletes must choose the best pacing strategy for a given situation, based on their physiological and psychological capabilities (Baron et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Fatigue, ambient conditions and manipulations of brain neurotransmitters clearly act on athletes' regulatory mechanisms and hence affect their exercise behavior (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The relationship between brain neurotransmitters and athletes' pacing behaviors seems to be mediated by the subjective interpretation of their physical state, also known as their rate of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Marcora and Staiano, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Interestingly, psychological factors implicated in athletes' endurance performance are thought to act through these same mechanisms. Both physiological and psychological factors act on motivation to continue or perception of effort and thus are important in the regulation of exercise intensity (Abbiss and Laursen, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>In understanding exercise regulation, most recent theories share the consideration of an interaction between the physical work realized and the cognitive and psychological interpretation of the sensations this physical work causes (Abbiss et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Millet, for example, propose the flush-model, which provides useful insight on how environmental conditions, such as sleep deprivation or nutritional strategies, may affect ultra-endurance performance (Millet, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This holistic model incorporates ratings of perceived fatigue as a crucial element of the regulation of exercise intensity and provides insight in the complexity of exercise regulation (Millet, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Fatigue during exercise has been described as being composed of both a neurophysiological and a subjective component (Pereira et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Enoka and Duchateau, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Cognitive and psychological factors thus are considered to play a key role in the perception of fatigue, for example in the psychobiological model. (Marcora and Staiano, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Noakes, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It seemshat perception of effort or fatigue can be regarded as a source of information, used for regulating exercise intensity (Marcora and Staiano, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Noakes, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Maladaptive pacing strategies therefore may result from a misinterpretation of RPE or, for example, concentrating on the wrong stimuli. Due to the subjective element in the perception of effort and fatigue, athletes are at risk of either investing too much or insufficient energy during their race leading to submaximal performance (Foster et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Baron et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). An optimal pacing strategy requires the continuous selection of the appropriate amount of effort to exert at any given moment (Baron et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), hence decision-making aspects are crucial in endurance exercise performance (Renfree et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Smits et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Recently, novel theoretical frameworks have been developed in order to explore decision-making and pacing.</p><p>Human-environment interactions seem crucial in understanding the regulation of exercise intensity in competitive situations. Internal factors, such as fatigue, and external factors, such as the behavior of an opponent, have indeed been shown to influence the drive to exercise, pacing and performance (Smits et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Konings et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>). Athletes seem to adapt their behavior to the actions of their opponents, for providing athletes with an opponent or feedback has been shown to impact on their power output, in middle-distance and endurance exercise (Noorbergen et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Konings et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Smits et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Between competing athletes of comparable physical capacities, the drive to exercise and its resulting decision making might thus represent the difference between victory and defeat (McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the observed effects of several external manipulations (Konings et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>) have been similar to those of the previously described pharmacological (and thus internal) interventions (e.g., Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This drive to exercise and its magnitude can thus be influenced by manipulation of various internal and external factors. One of these factors could be the nature and magnitude of an athlete's passion (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), influencing pacing behavior during exercise for example by modifying the perception and prioritizing of different stimuli (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Passion and pacing</title><p>Passion for sport is a strong motivational force, encouraging athletes to engage in strenuous exercise and pushing them to realize the countless training sessions and competitions needed to reach the top. Hence it might aid in enhancing athletic performance (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Harmonious passion indeed leads to a strong drive to exercise, compatible with enhanced concentration, feelings of mastery and positive emotions during a race (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These positive emotions have been linked to the development of optimal pacing behavior in sports, as athletes can use and manage their emotions to guide them toward optimal performance (Baron et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and to weigh their options wisely (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Harmonious passion also protects against negative distraction, unrealistic goals and stress during exercise (Vallerand et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and helps athletes to prioritize long term benefits over short term profits (Rip et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). As such, harmonious passion is believed crucial for attaining high levels of performance both on the short and the long term (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Although obsessive passion intuitively seems beneficial, it mostly leads to negative outcomes, both on the short as on the long term (Mageau and Vallerand, <xref rid="B13a" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Due to its compulsive nature, this type of passion is related to negative affect, stress, anxiety and feelings of guilt during exercise (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>During a race, dealing with both negative emotions and the task at hand is mentally and emotionally exhausting, so obsessive passion decreases athletes' ability to concentrate and attain a state of &#x0201c;flow&#x0201d; (Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, it hampers endurance performance by causing augmented feelings of exertion or erroneous interpretations of the athlete's capacities (Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A strong obsession with their activity may thus render athletes incapable of regulating their efforts wisely (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and may result in risky, all-out pacing strategies and in the inability to accept defeat (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Obsessive athletes also might intentionally disregard the limits of their physical and mental capacities for the sake of a short term victory (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), hence disregarding rational and &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; decisions that might prevent accidents, overtraining and overuse injuries (Rip et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Passion of an obsessive nature is therefore expected to prove particularly disadvantageous, considering the complex task of managing training and competition loads throughout a season (Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This inadequate decision-making regarding exercise behavior might eventually lead to overuse injuries, overtraining syndrome and burnout in obsessive athletes (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Further practical implications in sports: training adherence, burnout, and overtraining syndrome</title><p>The limiting factor for reaching and maintaining elite level in sports nowadays seems to be an athlete's capability to remain injury-free and to endure high training loads for a long period of time (Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Current demands in elite sports enhance athletes' risk for insufficient physical and mental recovery (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This may lead to athletes experiencing burnout or overtraining syndrome, resulting in physical and mental exhaustion and a considerably decreased drive to exercise (Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal regulation mechanisms associated with the development of these symptoms have been identified (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A major risk factor for injuries, overtraining and illness might be inadequate load management throughout the season (Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), which in turn has been suggested to be affected by factors of various nature, such as fatigue, psychology, and metabolic and hormonal factors (Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Symptoms of athlete burnout for example include both emotional and physical exhaustion (Rip et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Based on the above, we propose that athletes' passion and drive to exercise might lead to either adequate or inadequate pacing behavior and the subsequent effects on long term outcomes during an athlete's career. It was indeed demonstrated that measuring physical training load does not suffice in predicting or preventing long term injuries and neither do neurophysiological parameters alone (Meeusen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Overtraining and burnout may be caused by an interaction of both physical and psychological factors. Indeed, modifications of neurotransmitters in the brain lead to an alteration in pacing and willingness to exercise but also result in both the physical and emotional exhaustion characteristic for athlete burnout (Roelands et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition to these physiological parameters, psychological aspects, such as mood states, already have been identified as possible markers of overtraining and athlete burnout (Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Indeed, perceived motivational climate as well as athletes' commitment and coping with adversity might increase their vulnerability to detrimental long term outcomes (McCormick et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Schwellnus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These factors interestingly all are closely related to the nature of athletes' passion for and drive to exercise (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Bridekirk et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Elite endurance athletes must display a considerable drive and thus a great passion for their sport in order to perform at elite level (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Neurotransmitters have been identified as indispensable mediators between this drive to exercise and athletes' actual behavior. They inform athletes about their physical limits and the importance of continuing their effort, leading to adjustments in pacing strategies. In addition, external stimuli, such as opponents, could evoke similar responses by increasing the drive to exercise, hence affecting athletic decision-making. Passion for sport may come with a price for athletes obsessive about their sport.</p><p>We propose that the nature of elite athletes' passion for sport may provide useful insight in their decision making during exercise. It might affect pacing during a single exercise bout, but also influence exercise behavior during one or several years. Taking into account athletes' passion could therefore be a useful tool for adequate coaching and monitoring of athlete well-being. Although some athletes may be admirably capable of fitting their sport and high training loads into their ever-busy lives, obsessive athletes are expected to be extremely vulnerable to risks of injuries including overuse injuries, overtraining, burnout and drop out (Vallerand, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Curran et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Soligard et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Author contributions</title><p>LS and FH contributed to conception and design of the work, drafted it and revised it critically for important intellectual content.
