There have been numerous studies into the infection process of this soil-borne pathogen; however, the extent of research into the movement of the pathogen through the rhizome and into the rest of the plant is limited. Furthermore, little is known about the movement of the pathogen once it reaches the aerial components of the plant. A strain of <italic>Foc</italic> sub-tropical race 4, genetically transformed with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, was used to monitor the movement of the pathogen through two susceptible cultivars, Cavendish &#x02018;Williams&#x02019; (<italic>Musa</italic> AAA) and Lady Finger (<italic>Musa</italic> AAB). Visualization of the pathogen <italic>in planta</italic> demonstrated its presence in the roots, the rhizome and in the outer leaf sheaths of the pseudostem prior to the appearance of external symptoms. Within the non-senescing leaf sheaths, the migration of <italic>Foc</italic> was confined to the xylem vessels; this included those where the vascular tissue was visibly discolored, as well as those, which were apparently healthy. As senescence of leaf sheaths occurred, chlamydospores developed within the gas spaces, while formation of sporodochia, and hyphal growth were apparent on the outer surface of senescing leaf sheaths. These results generate a greater understanding of the epidemiology of <italic>Foc</italic>, providing much needed knowledge to assist in the future management of Fusarium wilt incursions, as well as enhancing protocols for ongoing on-farm hygiene and biosecurity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>cubense</italic></kwd><kwd>banana</kwd><kwd>GFP</kwd><kwd>Fusarium wilt</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Banana (<italic>Musa</italic> spp.) is one of the most important food crops in the world, with many developing countries relying on the fruit as a staple food (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Roux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2015</xref>). Banana is grown in approximately 120 tropical and subtropical countries, for both local and export markets (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Roux et al., 2008</xref>). Up to 40% of global banana production is reliant on the Cavendish subgroup (<italic>Musa</italic> AAA); this includes both domestic markets and the vast majority of export markets. As a consequence of low genetic diversity in banana production pest and disease pressure is one of the major limiting factors worldwide (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ghag et al., 2015</xref>). Of these diseases, Fusarium wilt, also known as Panama disease, caused by the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>cubense</italic> (E.F. Smith) Synder and Hansen (<italic>Foc</italic>), continues to be the greatest threat to global banana production (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2015</xref>). In the mid-20th century, global production of Gros Michel (<italic>Musa</italic> AAA), the former export cultivar of trade, succumbed to Fusarium wilt; the causal agent has since been described as <italic>Foc</italic> race 1 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Stover, 1962</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2005</xref>). However the replacement cultivar, Cavendish, is now under threat.</p><p><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. <italic>cubense</italic> is classified into four races, based on the host range of cultivars on which they cause disease, but there are at least 24 vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) within the different races (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mostert et al., 2017</xref>). The three main races affecting dessert banana include: <italic>Foc</italic> race 1 which causes disease on the cultivar Gros Michel as well as Lady Finger; <italic>Foc</italic> race 2, which affects the same cultivars as race 1 but also the cultivar Bluggoe; and race 4, which causes disease on most cultivars including Cavendish (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2015</xref>). Race 3 was at first described as a <italic>Musa</italic> infecting strain but has since been noted to only infect <italic>Heliconia</italic> spp. Initially, race 4 was known only to affect Cavendish cultivars in subtropical areas, where the relatively cooler temperatures are thought to increase Cavendish susceptibility (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2006</xref>). However, by the early 1990s, Cavendish cultivars in tropical areas of Southeast Asia began to succumb to Fusarium wilt, and hence, the realization of a &#x0201c;Tropical&#x0201d; race 4 of <italic>Foc</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz, 2015</xref>). Since then different VCGs have been used to distinguish between sub-tropical race 4 (SR4) (VCGs 0120,0129,01211, and 01215) and tropical race 4 (TR4) (VCG 01213-01216) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fourie et al., 2011</xref>). In Australia, Cavendish is the largest grown commercial crop of banana with the majority of production centered in north Queensland<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>. <italic>Foc</italic> TR4 was first identified in Australia in the Northern Territory in 1997 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cond&#x000e9; and Pitkethley, 1999</xref>). In 2015, the first ever incident of <italic>Foc</italic> TR4 in Queensland was detected in the Tully region, resulting in regional biosecurity monitoring, and enforcement (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill et al., 2016</xref>). With the first wave of Fusarium wilt of banana in the mid-20th century, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Stover (1972)</xref> then suggested that the only method of controlling the dissemination and subsequent infections by <italic>Foc</italic> in banana was by the quarantine or exclusion of infected properties or by planting non-host crops or cultivars. The same would appear to apply to <italic>Foc</italic> TR4.</p><p>Previous research into the infection process of <italic>Foc</italic>, using isolates transformed with the jellyfish green fluorescent pigment (GFP) gene, demonstrated the movement of the pathogen from the soil and into the roots and rhizome (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, only a limited body of research has been conducted demonstrating the continued movement of the pathogen from the rhizome, through the pseudostem, and into the rest of the plant. Using scanning electron microscopy allowed <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">VanderMolen et al. (1977)</xref> to observe the movement of <italic>Foc</italic>, along with the formation of the vascular gels and tyloses, in the xylem vessels. In doing so they found the naturally occurring end walls or perforation plates of the xylem strands somewhat inhibited the movement of the pathogen through the vessels. Microconidia trapped at these plates eventually germinated and were able to penetrate the perforation plate, and so continue to progress through the plant. <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Beckman (1964)</xref> used microscopic red vinyl particles to imitate microconidia and also extrapolated that conidia would be trapped at the scalariform vessel endings. <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. (2013)</xref> used a race 4 isolate of <italic>Foc</italic>, genetically transformed with GFP, to observe the movement through banana plants, tracking it from the roots through to the pseudostem. Using small plants and a large inoculum load, they found that <italic>Foc</italic> traveled through the roots, rhizome, and up the pseudostem, even reaching the outside of the pseudostem, by 24 days post inoculation. At this point the plants were showing severe symptoms or necrosis. Observations of <italic>Foc</italic> in the leaf blades of the plant or development of the long lived chlamydospores were not reported in the study by <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. (2013)</xref>.</p><p>As a soil borne pathogen, <italic>Foc</italic> persists in the soil on decayed host plant material or as chlamydospores in the absence of a suitable host. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Stover (1972)</xref> and <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ploetz (2006)</xref> suggested the chlamydospores are able to remain dormant and viable for up to 30 years in soil. These melanised resting spores germinate in the presence of root exudates from a favorable host. Chlamydospores of other <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> have also been reported to cause increased disease severity in their respective crops when compared to microconidia as an inoculum source (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Couteaudier and Alabouvette, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cal et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of any current commercially viable cultivars resistant to <italic>Foc</italic> TR4 and lack of any effective fungicides, the only means of control is avoidance through quarantine and good hygiene practices. For such, a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of <italic>Foc</italic> is necessary. Knowledge of the movement of the pathogen within the plant tissues and its potential to persist in the plant debris is vital to ensure appropriate biosecurity strategies are deployed. The aim of this study was to assess the movement of <italic>Foc</italic> SR4 through entire susceptible banana plants, monitoring its growth in both healthy and senescing sections of the plants. For this purpose, a GFP transformed strain of <italic>Foc</italic> SR4 (<italic>Foc</italic> GFP) was used; quarantine restrictions prohibited the use of <italic>Foc</italic> TR4. Also investigated was the timing and tissue type in which the long-lived chlamydospores were produced.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Planting Material</title><p>Two susceptible banana cultivars were used in this experiment, Cavendish &#x02018;Williams&#x02019; (<italic>Musa</italic> AAA) and Lady Finger (<italic>Musa</italic> AAB). Tissue culture plants were deflasked and placed into steam sterilized UQ23 soil mix [70% composted pine bark 0&#x02013;5 mm, 30% coco peat (coir)] and kept under 12 h fluorescent light for approximately 30 days. Plants were repotted into 140 mm (1.3 L) pots, using steam sterilized UQ23 soil mix and transferred to a containment glasshouse at the St Lucia Campus of The University of Queensland, Brisbane, where they were maintained at 26&#x000b0;C in a natural day light cycle between the months of September to April. For each of the eight time treatments (see below), three replicate plants of each cultivar were prepared as well as three replicates of both cultivars for the controls. Each pot was contained inside a double layer of autoclave bags to contain the genetically transformed <italic>Foc</italic>. To prevent waterlogging, the plants were monitored daily and watered as necessary. Four weeks after repotting, the plants were inoculated as described below.

Following sterilization, each 100 g of the millet was inoculated with a 5 mm round plug of PDA containing <italic>Foc</italic> GFP. The control millet was left uninoculated. The inoculated millet was placed in an incubator set at 25&#x000b0;C for 2 weeks. In preparation for plant inoculation, the millet was ground using a mortar and pestle, and 15 mL of millet was spread around the base of the banana plants and covered with sterile UQ23 mix soil. The plants were not watered until the day after inoculation to allow the <italic>Foc</italic> GFP to colonize. Uninoculated millet was ground and distributed onto the control plants in the same method as for the <italic>Foc</italic> GFP millet.</p></sec><sec><title>Plant Sampling and Confocal Microscopy</title><p>Every 10 days post inoculation (dpi) for a period of 80 days, six Lady Finger and six Cavendish plant were harvested (three controls and three inoculated plants).

Additionally, several plants failed to produce either xylem fluid or laticifer sap when sections of the pseudostem were removed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Green fluorescent protein-traced pathogens have been widely used to study infection processes through numerous species and their hosts (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lagopodi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Vallad and Subbarao, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000fc; et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Observing the pathogen which has been transformed with GFP has the distinct advantage of being able to provide a visual analysis of the spore development stages of the pathogen <italic>in planta</italic>. The results of the confocal microscopy in this study provided important information regarding the development of chlamydospores in the pseudostem of the plant, as well as evidence of the pathogen moving through the plant prior to the occurrence of external symptoms. The latter has particular relevance for the management and containment of <italic>Foc</italic> in the field. Similarities between the two cultivars assessed included the confinement of the pathogen to xylem vessels while the leaf sheath was healthy and intact, as well as the movement of the pathogen to the outer surface of decaying leaf sheaths. This is the first known study detailing this progression of <italic>Foc</italic> within entire susceptible Cavendish and Lady Finger banana plants; albeit confined within a glasshouse setting.</p><p>The movement of <italic>Foc</italic> through the roots in this study was similar to that previously observed with <italic>Foc</italic> GFP by <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. (2013)</xref>. Chlamydospores and microconidia were observed to germinate around the root tip and among root hairs, prior to penetrating the epidermal cells and moving through the elongation zone intercellularly. However, this study differed from <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2011)</xref> in that no intracellular movement or intracellular reproduction of the pathogen was observed within the roots. These differences may be attributed to the age of the plants when inoculated, banana cultivars assessed, inoculation methods or indeed the use of different fungal isolates; in the current study a sub-tropical race 4 isolate belonging to VCG 120 was used. Intracellular and intercellular movement of the pathogen have, however, been observed using other <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> transformed with GFP when assessed on tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) and strawberry (<italic>Fragaria ananassa</italic> Duch.) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lagopodi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The various <italic>formae speciales</italic> of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> are generally regarded as hemi-biotrophs, where the initial infection occurs as a biotroph, and switches to a necrotroph as the plant defense system reacts to the biotrophic invasion (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bhadauria et al., 2009</xref>). Observations of the movement of the pathogen through the intercellular spaces of the root epidermal cells is characteristic of a biotrophic pathogen and has been noted in the infection process of other <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lagopodi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, differences in the potential of strains of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> to grow inter or intra-cellularly during different stages of the infection process may be highly relevant and worthy of further investigation.</p><p>The increasing abundance of <italic>Foc</italic> observed on the outer leaf sheaths as they senesced demonstrates the saprophytic ability of the pathogen to grow continuously on decayed plant material. These decaying outer sheaths were also a location where a high production of chlamydospores was observed. De-leafing is a common practice on banana plantations and is used as a cultural method of controlling banana leaf spot diseases such as black and yellow Sigatoka caused <italic>Pseudocercospora fijiensis</italic> (Morelete) and <italic>Pseudocercospora musae</italic> (Zimm.), respectively (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>). This study provides evidence that leaves removed from plants infected with <italic>Foc</italic>, but not yet showing significant symptoms, may later contribute to an increase in the inoculum levels found in the soil. Additionally, the growth of <italic>Foc</italic> on the outside of the leaf sheaths may also provide additional inoculum for aerial dissemination of the pathogen by human or animal/insect influence.</p><p>The movement of <italic>Foc</italic> to the outside of the leaf sheath via stomata has seldom been reported. <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brandes (1919)</xref> noted sporodochia emerging through the stomata on the leaf bases, most commonly at the point where the sheath moves away from the pseudostem. The same development was observed in this study with both sporodochia and mycelia protruding from stomata. A similar study using <italic>Foc</italic> GFP conducted by <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. (2013)</xref> noted <italic>Foc</italic> on the outside of leaf sheaths, however, there was no evidence to show it moving through the stomata. In the study by <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al. (2013)</xref>, the pathogen was shown to move intercellularly through the decaying leaf sheaths and was observed there 24 days post inoculation. The use of a different isolate, potentially one that was <italic>Foc</italic> TR4, may have resulted in the rapid progression of disease development in their study, resulting in necrotic plants at 24 dpi. Additionally, implementing a bare root dip as the inoculation method may have allowed symptom development and pathogen movement to progress at a faster rate than seen in this current experiment using millet inoculum.</p><p>Identifying whether it was microconidia or hyphae that were responsible for the spread of the fungus throughout the pseudostem could not be determined in this study. In some areas, microconidia were observed prior to any signs of hyphae, while at other times, single or multiple strands of hyphae were observed without the presence of any microconidia.</p><p>Contrary to observations made by <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beckman and Halmos (1962)</xref> and <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beckman et al. (1962)</xref>, the pull of microconidia in the transpiration stream and their subsequent trapping in the vessel ends of the vascular elements was not observed. The method of growing the plants axenically and directly inoculating cut roots with a microconidia suspension may have attributed to the observations of <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Beckman and Halmos (1962)</xref> and <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Beckman et al. (1962)</xref>, bypassing the infection process undertaken naturally in a soil environment.</p><p>The use of <italic>Foc</italic> GFP revealed specific details, highlighting the actual progression and etiology of the pathogen <italic>in planta</italic>. The use of the <italic>Foc</italic> GFP demonstrated the movement of the pathogen from the initial infection of the roots, through the rhizome, into the pseudostem and to the leaves at the top of the plant. Several key findings were observed through this process. The movement of the pathogen to the outer surface of senescing or decayed leaf sheaths, followed by the substantial production of macroconidia and chlamydospores, has serious implications regarding the pathogens potential spread. However how this relates to mature plants in field conditions requires further investigation. Future studies into possible air borne or vectored spread of inoculum and the potential for the pathogen to infect a healthy plant via aerial inoculation are required. Additionally, the production of chlamydospores in and on these outer leaf sheaths increases the risk of long-lived resting spores returning to the soil through cultural methods such as de-leafing. Identification of the progress of the pathogen into the pseudostem prior to external symptom development also provides vital information to assist in the advancement of monitoring and containment protocols currently in place where Fusarium wilt threatens banana production. This study has provided a comprehensive visualization of the movement of the pathogen through banana plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>NW conducted the experimental procedure including glasshouse studies and confocal microscopy; analyzed the results and wrote the majority of the manuscript.
