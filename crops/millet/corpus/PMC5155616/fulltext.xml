First, strategies for point-of-manufacture chemical fortification are compared with biofortification achieved through plant breeding. Recent insights into the mechanisms of human iron absorption and regulation, the mechanisms by which iron can promote malaria and bacterial infections, and the role of iron in modifying the gut microbiota are summarized. There is strong evidence that supplemental iron given in nonphysiological amounts can increase the risk of bacterial and protozoal infections (especially malaria), but the use of lower quantities of iron provided within a food matrix, ie, fortified food, should be safer in most cases and represents a more logical strategy for a sustained reduction of the risk of deficiency by providing the best balance of risk and benefits. Further research into iron compounds that would minimize the availability of unabsorbed iron to the gut microbiota is warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>food fortification</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>staple foods</kwd><kwd>supplementation.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Iron deficiency is estimated to be the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency worldwide and contributes to multiple pathologies mediated both through iron-deficiency anemia<xref rid="nuw055-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1&#x02013;3</sup></xref> and through direct effects on the formation and function of organs, especially the brain.<xref rid="nuw055-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4&#x02013;6</sup></xref> The reduction of iron-deficiency anemia is one of the six priorities of the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO&#x02019;s) <italic>Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutrition</italic>.<xref rid="nuw055-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> These priorities have been adopted as Priority Nutrition Indicators for the United Nation&#x02019;s post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.<xref rid="nuw055-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>The highest prevalence rates of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia occur in low-income countries where the combination of poor diet and high levels of infection chronically limits the uptake of iron. Because such populations can rarely afford iron-rich diets, especially those that contain the more bioavailable heme iron, the WHO recommends that governments of countries with a high prevalence of anemia implement programs of universal iron supplementation for young children and pregnant women.<xref rid="nuw055-B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>There are two problems with this approach: low levels of implementation, and the possibility that supplements may induce harmful side effects. In 2006, a significant excess of serious adverse events in African children receiving iron during a very large intervention trial<xref rid="nuw055-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> raised serious concerns about the safety of iron supplements. These concerns have been reinforced by subsequent studies<xref rid="nuw055-B13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13&#x02013;15</sup></xref> and are made plausible by the known stimulatory effect of iron on potentially pathogenic bacteria and protozoa.<xref rid="nuw055-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> An expert committee convened by the WHO<xref rid="nuw055-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> posited that it may be the nonphysiological nature of highly absorbable iron supplements, which bypass nature&#x02019;s evolved systems for safely chaperoning iron and result in an excess of nontransferrin-bound iron, that underlies the harmful effects. The committee concluded that, although not yet proven, it was likely that iron delivered through the natural matrix of foods would be a safer alternative.</p><p>There are several methods currently in use for augmenting the level of dietary iron. Supplements (administered in the form of capsules or drops) are often used for the treatment of severe iron deficiency in a targeted population. Point-of-use fortification employs micronutrient powders in the form of packed, single-dose sachets that can be added to prepared food to improve its nutrient value. Biofortification involves the targeted breeding of staple food crops in order to increase their intrinsic content of micronutrients, including iron. Food fortification is the addition of micronutrients at the point of manufacture to enhance the nutritional content of the food items, such as meal ingredients or condiments. Unlike supplementation, iron fortification at the point of manufacture enables the delivery of small doses of the micronutrient in a food vehicle alongside the possibility of several servings per day. It is slower to raise body iron levels compared with iron supplementation or iron therapy, but it might be safer. The purpose of this review is to critically assess the latest evidence on the effects of dietary iron and the safety of augmenting iron levels using current strategies across all populations, including those from environments or settings with high levels of infection.</p></sec><sec><title>IRON FORTIFICATION OF FOOD</title><p>Numerous studies have evaluated the effect of iron fortification in terms of health<xref rid="nuw055-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18&#x02013;20</sup></xref> and economic benefits.<xref rid="nuw055-B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Although many of the existing studies are based on food fortification in general, some have focused on specific packaged foods, such as beverages,<xref rid="nuw055-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> milk, cereals,<xref rid="nuw055-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and condiments.<xref rid="nuw055-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p><p>Fortification of food products with iron implies the addition of iron-containing substances to the product recipe, either as isolated compounds (eg, iron salts or chelates) or as iron-rich ingredients (eg, meat or its derivatives). The choice of these ingredients is influenced by the desired product characteristics, including taste and color, and may be constrained by cost.</p><p>Although iron has been added to diverse food items since the early 1940s,<xref rid="nuw055-B25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> its addition to packaged food products still poses technical challenges. Because of its oxidation-reduction properties, iron can create chemical instability in the food matrix, inducing organoleptic changes that are often unacceptable to the consumer.<xref rid="nuw055-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> To overcome this technical obstacle, the industry uses insoluble, poorly soluble, or strongly chelated<xref rid="nuw055-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> iron compounds, all of which have limited chemical reactivity. However, both solubility and chemical availability are necessary for effective absorption (bioavailability) of inorganic or nonheme iron. The preferred iron carriers must therefore offer a balance of these properties. These carriers must be tailored to the specific food product. For example, more soluble carriers can be used in dark-colored items (such as soy and fish sauces), which are less affected by color changes but are still prone to alterations in taste. Iron may react with other components of food products (such as unsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins, etc), thereby affecting the shelf life and/or the nutritive value.</p><p>Beyond these technical issues, a key consideration is the bioavailability of the added iron. While heme iron is well absorbed in the human digestive tract, nonheme iron is generally poorly absorbed.<xref rid="nuw055-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Besides the differences in the mechanism of absorption of these two types of iron by the enterocytes &#x02013; discussed elsewhere in this article &#x02013; the absorption of nonheme iron is subject to strong interference from other common food components such as phytates from cereals<xref rid="nuw055-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and other staple foods (sorghum, pulses) or polyphenolic structures from fruits and vegetables. In fact, polyphenols can even inhibit the absorption of heme iron.<xref rid="nuw055-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p>The main iron compounds used for fortification of packaged foods are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="nuw055-T1">Table 1</xref>, together with a qualitative assessment of their solubility and bioavailability (based on several references<xref rid="nuw055-B26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31&#x02013;34</sup></xref>).

It has been noted repeatedly that phytoferritin has high potential as a food fortificant.<xref rid="nuw055-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Currently, however, phytoferritin is not available commercially; therefore, it can be used only in products that contain sufficient amounts of foods that are naturally rich in this protein, such as pulses (beans, lentils, etc).

The claim &#x0201c;source of iron&#x0201d; requires that a product contain a minimum of 15% of the iron NRV (14 mg/d), ie, 2.1 mg per measure.

By combining traditional breeding with modern techniques, biofortification blends the traits of high-yield crop varieties with high-iron varieties.<xref rid="nuw055-B43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> In principle, the use of biofortified crops could address micronutrient deficiencies by enriching the staple food items that constitute the main portion of the diet in poor countries. Therefore, even very small amounts of micronutrients could have a positive impact over time. A second part of the reasoning is that, if biofortified crops also possess excellent agronomic characteristics, a self-sustaining public health intervention will result because farmers will favor such crops.</p><p>Iron biofortification is applicable to cereals like wheat, rice, and millet and to pulses like beans, peas, and lentils.

Of central importance has been the discovery of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, and the elucidation of its mode of action in maintaining healthy body iron status.<xref rid="nuw055-B60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> These basic science discoveries are of profound importance to the rational design of next-generation strategies for combating global iron deficiency and can inform predictions about the likely safety and efficacy of iron fortification programs.</p><p>Many detailed summaries of iron absorption and regulation are available elsewhere.<xref rid="nuw055-B61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> In brief, soluble nonheme iron from the diet is reduced from Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> by a brush border ferric reductase, duodenal cytochrome B. The enterocyte then internalizes Fe<sup>2+</sup> via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). It has been proposed that forms of nanoparticulate nonheme iron, such as the ferritin iron core, can be taken up whole by the enterocyte through endocytosis and are then dissolved only in vesicles inside the cell.<xref rid="nuw055-B39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62&#x02013;64</sup></xref></p><p>Intracellular iron, derived from both pathways above, can then be stored (only temporarily, however, as the cells have a rapid rate of turnover) or transported across the basolateral membrane into the circulation. This process is facilitated by a single transmembrane transporter, ferroportin. The Fe<sup>2+</sup> is then oxidized by the ferroxidases hephaestin and ceruloplasmin before it is taken up by the chaperone transporter transferrin for distribution to other organs and tissues.</p><p>Hepcidin regulates iron absorption by binding to ferroportin. When hepcidin binds to the extracellular arm of ferroportin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, thus preventing iron egress. The iron blocked within the enterocytes initiates an intracellular regulation mechanism that further reduces the entrance of iron into the cell through divalent metal transporter 1; this blocked iron is ultimately excreted in the stool when the enterocytes die.</p><p>This new knowledge forces a radical reinterpretation of nutritionists&#x02019; concepts of iron absorption in several key respects. First, it has long been known that humans have no physiological means of regulating iron status through active excretion of iron, except for the loss of enterocytic iron that was never been fully absorbed. Iron is lost through menstruation or intentional or unintentional blood loss (trauma, childbirth, or therapeutic phlebotomy for iron overload), but these processes are unregulated. Therefore, the regulation of iron absorption is critical to the maintenance of healthy iron homeostasis. Furthermore, unlike regulatory processes in other metals such as zinc, whose efflux is regulated by multiple mechanisms, iron efflux from cells is regulated by a single mechanism, ie, ferroportin, which consequently allows precise control. Likewise, iron is the only trace element for which a hormone regulator, ie, hepcidin, has been discovered. As evidenced by these characteristics, iron absorption is a highly regulated process.</p><p>The earlier view held by nutritionists (and, hence, by policymakers) was that, when low iron levels in the body were due to low dietary intake of iron, the solution was to recommend large bolus doses of highly absorbable iron to be given between meals (to avoid the iron being bound to food phytates and related chelators) and, preferably, with vitamin C to enhance the reduction of iron from Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. This strategy works against the complex evolved mechanisms for the safe absorption and distribution of iron and may have caused significant iatrogenic disease (see below).</p><p>Further inferences from recent basic science discoveries relevant to iron fortification and supplementation derive from a new understanding of hepcidin regulation and from additional insights into genetic defects in iron pathways. Hepcidin is a downregulator of iron absorption and traffic, not an enhancer. It functions as the main inhibitor of iron transport from cells (including enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages) into the blood circulation. At subthreshold levels of hepcidin, the divalent metal transporter 1 and ferroportin gates at both ends of the enterocytes are open, and iron is absorbed efficiently. Stable isotope studies in Gambian children have shown that iron absorption can be as high as 50% when hepcidin is switched off<xref rid="nuw055-B65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> and is virtually zero at high levels of circulating hepcidin. Hepcidin levels are suppressed by iron deficiency and are elevated by either iron sufficiency/overload or inflammation.<xref rid="nuw055-B66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> Two stable isotope absorption studies in Beninese women and Ivorian children demonstrated that iron absorption was doubled after asymptomatic malaria infection was cleared and hepcidin concentrations were reduced by approximately 50%.<xref rid="nuw055-B67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref></p><p>Therefore, hepcidin provides an elaborate system for the body to autoregulate iron influx by balancing the competing signals indicating a need for iron (hypoxia, erythroid drive, and hepatic iron deficiency) against the possible threat of an infection that might be fuelled by additional iron. In iron-deficient populations, hepcidin levels would tend to be low (to allow absorption) but are often high because systemic inflammation heralds the threat of infection. The interplay of these competing factors has been described in some detail for Gambian and Kenyan children.<xref rid="nuw055-B69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> The take-home message for policymakers is that, rather than being unable to absorb adequate levels of iron, people living in unsanitary settings devote considerable physiological effort to <italic>exclude</italic> iron from their circulation. This is further validated by the tendency for all but one of the known genetic defects that alter iron status to lead to iron overload rather than deficiency, even in populations living on a low-iron diet.</p></sec><sec><title>IRON, MALARIA, AND OTHER INFECTIONS</title><p>A decade ago, the WHO recommended that preschool children and pregnant women receive universal iron supplementation in countries in which the prevalence of anemia exceeded 40%. This included the great majority of low- and lower-middle&#x02013;income countries. In practice, this advice was rarely implemented, and it was deemed necessary to gather stronger evidence of benefit to strengthen the arguments of advocacy. To this end, two very large intervention trials were commissioned in Pemba Island, Tanzania, and Nepal to compare the impact on overall mortality of iron plus folic acid; iron plus zinc; iron plus folic acid and zinc; and zinc alone against placebo in infants and young children. The trial in Tanzania was stopped early by the trial&#x02019;s data safety monitoring board because there was evidence of a higher incidence of severe adverse events (hospitalizations from malaria and other infections and deaths) in the two arms receiving iron plus folic acid than in the zinc alone and placebo arms.<xref rid="nuw055-B12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The Nepali trial (conducted in a nonmalarious region) showed no such effect,<xref rid="nuw055-B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> and it was hence concluded that the adverse events in the trial in Tanzania had been caused by the interaction between iron and malaria.

They further advised that supplementation be accompanied by strategies to prevent and treat malaria. Notably, food fortification was deemed to be safe and was explicitly excluded from this advice because &#x0201c;the patterns of iron absorption and metabolism may be substantially different.&#x0201d;<xref rid="nuw055-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>The adverse outcome of the now infamous Pemba trial had the benefit of directing funding toward further field trials and generated a considerable body of basic research designed to elucidate the reasons behind the increased numbers of infections and deaths. It was widely speculated that nontransferrin-bound iron might be responsible. Under normal circumstances, all iron in the circulation would be tightly bound within transferrin and, hence, safely chaperoned to reduce the likelihood that it could be made available as nontransferrin-bound iron to any infectious organisms in the bloodstream. However, large nonphysiological bolus doses of iron can overwhelm the capacity of transferrin to collect iron, resulting in the formation of nontransferrin-bound iron.<xref rid="nuw055-B71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> The potential link between nontransferrin-bound iron and infections is almost entirely based on conjecture. There are strong associations between percent transferrin saturation and the likelihood of systemic bacterial infections.<xref rid="nuw055-B72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria use two basic strategies to acquire iron from their human hosts: (1) chelation of iron away from chaperone proteins with siderophores; and/or (2) direct uptake of hemoglobin and heme moieties.

Most impressively, Gwamaka et al.<xref rid="nuw055-B75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> monitored 785 children over a period of 3 years in Tanzania and showed that iron-deficiency anemia significantly decreased the odds of both subsequent parasitemia (23% decrease, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and severe malaria (38% decrease, <italic>P</italic>&#x02005; = &#x02005;0.04). This might operate at both the hepatic and the blood stages of the plasmodial life cycle. Studies in mice have shown that, during an initial infection, the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite can protect itself from competition from another strain by utilizing the host&#x02019;s hepcidin pathway to reduce iron in hepatocytes to such a level that the subsequent infection cannot establish a foothold.<xref rid="nuw055-B76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> This prevents so-called superinfection and might reduce mortality in children. The mechanism is more potent when the host is iron deficient. Of probably greater relevance is the finding that iron-deficient red blood cells have a markedly reduced capacity to support plasmodial replication and growth.<xref rid="nuw055-B77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> However, this protection is reversed by the presence of reticulocytes and young red blood cells, which are the favored niche for the merozoite stage.

If this is the case, then the major source of iron for bacteria in the gut will be unabsorbed soluble forms of iron, which will be found in the highest concentrations when excess iron is consumed (as in the case of therapeutic supplementation).</p><p>These theoretical predictions are borne out by in vitro, animal, and human clinical studies,<xref rid="nuw055-B93" ref-type="bibr"><sup>93</sup></xref> highlights of which are summarized here.

A major barrier to adopting the targeted approach is the detection of iron deficiency. Aside from the lack of established biomarkers of iron status that can be easily applied in the field, screening for iron status at the population level is challenging.

Folic acid fortification, for example, has played a key role in reducing birth defects in Canada, the United States, and Chile and is a good strategy for reaching the population of women at risk of deficiency.<xref rid="nuw055-B119" ref-type="bibr"><sup>119</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>120</sup></xref> The ingestion of small amounts of iron with food provides an opportunity to minimize circulating levels of nontransferrin-bound iron or high concentrations of unabsorbed iron in the gut.</p><p>A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention trial performed a head-to-head comparison between iron supplements and food fortification in 425 Vietnamese school-aged children.<xref rid="nuw055-B121" ref-type="bibr"><sup>121</sup></xref> Results showed that, although both interventions yielded significant improvements over placebo in terms of hemoglobin, ferritin, and body iron levels and anemia status, the increases in the fortification group were less pronounced compared with those in the supplement group. These differences were most likely due to the lower amounts of iron received with fortification. After comparing the effectiveness of both approaches, the authors concluded that, in a population of anemic children with mild iron deficiency, iron fortification should be the preferred strategy over the longer term.</p><p>Infants and young children are among those at greatest risk of not only iron deficiency but also the developmental consequences of iron deficiency. Although infants aged 6 to 24 months are not often included in global estimates of iron-deficiency anemia, current evidence indicates that this group is at particularly high risk.<xref rid="nuw055-B122" ref-type="bibr"><sup>122</sup></xref> Beyond 6 months of age, an infant&#x02019;s need for iron begins to exceed the amount provided by breast milk.<xref rid="nuw055-B123" ref-type="bibr"><sup>123</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="nuw055-B124" ref-type="bibr"><sup>124</sup></xref> This is more pronounced in infants who show rapid growth, such as low-birth-weight infants who undergo catch-up growth.<xref rid="nuw055-B122" ref-type="bibr"><sup>122</sup></xref> A recent systematic review of 18 trials found that the use of milk and cereal products fortified with iron plus multiple micronutrients increased hemoglobin levels by 8.7 g/L in children aged 6 months to 5 years and reduced the risk of anemia by 57% compared with the use of nonfortified items.<xref rid="nuw055-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The introduction of iron-rich complementary foods has also shown a beneficial effect on the iron status of infants.<xref rid="nuw055-B125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>125</sup></xref> The Chilean National Complementary Feeding Program showed that iron-fortified milk improved iron status and reduced the prevalence of anemia over the long term in children aged 11 to 18 months. The prevalence of anemia was 27% prior to the introduction of the program but was reduced to 9% 1 year after the introduction of the program (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref rid="nuw055-B126" ref-type="bibr"><sup>126</sup></xref> After adjusting for confounding factors, the consumption of iron-fortified milk was associated with higher hemoglobin concentrations and a lower prevalence of anemia. The benefits were apparent 10 years after the implementation of the program, suggesting long-term, sustained effects on iron status and the prevalence of anemia in children.</p><p>Thus far, there has been no data demonstrating specific adverse effects of iron-fortified food items. In their systematic review, Eichler et al.<xref rid="nuw055-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> suggest that the recommendations for iron supplements may not apply to fortified foods, since the daily dose of micronutrients obtained with fortified foods is far lower than that obtained with supplementation. There are still uncertainties about the hemoglobin cutoff values used to define anemia in children and in specific populations such as those with hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia, and repeated blood transfusions. Thus far, most studies have used iron status, hemoglobin levels, or anemia as measures of efficacy of iron fortification. Long-term functional outcomes &#x02013; such as growth, cognitive development, morbidity, economic productivity &#x02013; are more difficult to measure, but additional data on these will be the true measure of the long-term safety and efficacy of any intervention. Long-term data on the use of fortified foods in populations with a high disease burden (including malaria and other infectious diseases) are thus needed to determine the best means of addressing iron deficiency at the population level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The evidence summarized here leads to several conclusions. First, new insights into human iron metabolism, especially those derived from the discovery of the hepcidin/ferroportin system for regulating iron uptake, suggest that the strategy of providing large nonphysiological bolus doses of highly absorbable iron as supplements works against the highly evolved systems for safely maintaining iron homeostasis in humans and, hence, may be hazardous. Second, an important cause of iron deficiency is the inflammatory blockade, and any strategy to reduce iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia should include interventions to limit infections and inflammation (including low-grade inflammation). If inflammation can be reduced, then elimination of the iron blockade will permit healthy iron homeostasis at lower levels of dietary iron. Third, chemical or biological fortification of staple foods provides a logical approach as a public health strategy and should be pursued. The data do not support the conclusion that iron-fortified foods are without risk, but any possible risks are probably much lower than those associated with the high burden of disease and reduced functional capacity caused by iron deficiency worldwide. When cost or any other constraint prevents treatment of inflammation or infection, fortification with low doses of iron homogeneously diluted in a larger mass of food remains one of the safest strategies available to reduce the risk of deficiency. These considerations are important in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, since iron-deficiency anemia is a main indicator of micronutrient deficiencies among women of reproductive age and children under the age of 5 years. Future research is required to examine the effects of unabsorbed iron on the gut microbiota. Further testing of compounds containing iron that is absorbable in the human duodenum but is unavailable to potentially pathogenic bacteria in the large intestine and colon is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Y.A.M., A.C., and J.S. are employed by the Nestl&#x000e9; Research Centre, Lausanne, Switzerland.</p><p><italic>Funding</italic>.
