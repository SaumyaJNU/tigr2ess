    "Intracortical microelectrodes (IME) are neural devices that initially were designed to function as neuroscience tools to enable researchers to understand the nervous system. Over the years, technology that aids interfacing with the nervous system has allowed the ability to treat patients with a wide range of neurological injuries and diseases. Despite the substantial success that has been demonstrated using IME in neural interface applications, these implants eventually fail due to loss of quality recording signals. Recent strategies to improve interfacing with the nervous system have been inspired by methods that mimic the native tissue. This review focusses on one strategy in particular, nano-architecture, a term we introduce that encompasses the approach of roughening the surface of the implant. Various nano-architecture approaches have been hypothesized to improve the biocompatibility of IMEs, enhance the recording quality, and increase the longevity of the implant. This review will begin by introducing IME technology and discuss the challenges facing the clinical deployment of IME technology. The biological inspiration of nano-architecture approaches will be explained as well as leading fabrication methods used to create nano-architecture and their limitations. A review of the effects of nano-architecture surfaces on neural cells will be examined, depicting the various cellular responses to these modified surfaces in both in vitro and pre-clinical models. The proposed mechanism elucidating the ability of nano-architectures to influence cellular phenotype will be considered. Finally, the frontiers of next generation nano-architecture IMEs will be identified, with perspective given on the future impact of this interfacing approach."
