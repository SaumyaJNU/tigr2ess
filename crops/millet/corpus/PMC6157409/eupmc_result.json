    "Rhizosphere bacterial communities of kodo millet plant was analyzed from a large metagenome sequence dataset. Plant rhizosphere samples of kodo millet was collected in replicates and the metagenomic sequence data were obtained through shotgun sequencing. Overall sequences in the dataset were 476,649 comprising total read length of 179,349,372 base pairs. Taxonomic data analysis led to characterize Î±-diversity of 107 species. Dominance of actinobacteria followed by unclassified sequences (derived from Bacteria) was recorded. Raw data along with the analysis result is publicly available from the MG-RAST server with ID mgm4761530.3."
