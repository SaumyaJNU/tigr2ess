    "Sodium ion batteries meet the demand for large-scale energy storage, such as in electric vehicles, due to the material abundance of sodium. In this report, nanotube-type Na2V3O7 is proposed as a cathode material because of its fast sodium diffusivity, an important requirement for sodium ion batteries, through the investigation of ~4300 candidates via a high-throughput computation. High-rate performance was confirmed, showing ~65% capacity retention at a current density of 10C at room temperature, despite the large particle size of >5 μm. A good cycle performance of ca. 94% in capacity retention after 50 cycles was obtained owing to a small volumetric change of <0.4%."
