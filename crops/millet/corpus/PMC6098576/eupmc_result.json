    "Pallister Killian syndrome (PKS, OMIM 601803) is a rare genetic disorder with a distinct phenotype caused by tissue- limited mosaicism tetrasomy of the short arm of chromosome 12, which usually cytogenetically presents as an extra isochromosome 12p.Wide phenotypic variability in PKS has been reported, ranging from pre-to perinatal death due to multiple congenital anomalies, especially diaphragmatic hernia, and classic phenotypes including seizures, severe developmental delay, macrosomia at birth, deafness, and distinct dysmorphic features, such as coarse face, temporal alopecia, a small nose with anteverted nostrils, long philtrum, and hypo-/hyper- pigmented streaks on the skin.Karyotypes obtained from cultured peripheral lymphocytes of 13 cases, who were diagnosed as PKS, were normal, while karyotypes obtained from cultured skin samples and buccal mucosa revealed the supernumerary mosaic i(12p). Mosaic karyotype was found in both fibroblast and buccal mucosa in 14 of 15 patients in our series, whereas in one stillbirth, following the clinical diagnosis of PKS, skin and buccal smear samples were taken, and all karyotypes from cultured fibroblasts revealed a supernumerary i(12p), while I-FISH study showed 60% mosaicism in mucosal cells.We here share the clinical, cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic findings of 15 cases with PKS phenotype and the parental origin of seven i(12p) identified by molecular analyses. To our knowledge, this is the largest series of PKS patients with parental origin study from a single center. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we specifically found no differences in the phenotypes of cases with either a maternal or paternal origin of the extra element and differential imprinting appeared not to be a factor."
