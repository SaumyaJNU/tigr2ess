The transmission of an emotional state from one individual to another is called &#x0201c;emotional contagion&#x0201d; and is classified as the first level of empathy. Emotional contagion is thought to be stronger between familiar individuals. While affiliation represents a stronger relation between individuals than mere familiarity, it remains understudied whether affiliation modulates emotional reactions as well. Using cockatiels (<italic>Nymphicus hollandicus)</italic>, we played back three types of audio stimuli to individual birds: a partner&#x02019;s distress call (emitted when birds are caught or forcibly restrained), a non-partner&#x02019;s distress call, and a control sound (white noise). The calls were recorded from familiar birds with either low (non&#x02013;partners) or high levels of affiliation (partners). The subjects&#x02019; response was scored using four behavioural parameters: the time spent near the loudspeaker, the amount of movements, the number of calls emitted, and the position of the crest. Across all variables, birds were more attentive and active when confronted to distress calls compared to control sounds, particularly when the distress call was emitted from a partner rather than a non-partner. These results raise the possibility that distress calls do not only function as a stimulus-triggering automatic reaction in cockatiels but also transmit emotions. Moreover, affiliation enhanced emotional reactions to conspecific distress calls. Our data provides first insights into the mechanisms of emotional contagion in parrots.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003990</institution-id><institution>Conseil R&#x000e9;gional, &#x000ce;le-de-France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6954-5573</contrib-id><name><surname>Li&#x000e9;vin-Bazin</surname><given-names>Agatha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work received support from R&#x000e9;gion &#x000ce;le de France, DIM Cerveau et pens&#x000e9;e, to ALB.

The lowest level, and less cognitively demanding form of empathy, is emotional contagion. It can be described as the triggering of a similar emotional response in both an emitter and a receiver [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The transmission of emotional states from one individual to another may manifest in altered sensory, motor, and physiological states of others (i.e. increase in cortisol level, heart rate and locomotion) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Emotional contagion is closely linked to automatic mimicry, the tendency to imitate and synchronize with the movements of others [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Acoustic communication can be a useful medium to investigate emotional contagion. Vocalizations encode a broad range of information about the emitter such as identity, age, weight [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], sex, kinship [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], dominance status [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or emotional states[<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Perceiving information about the emitter&#x02019;s emotions can potentially induce the same emotional state in a receiver or may simply increase its emotional arousal [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Certain types of calls such as alarm or distress calls might have intense emotional salience and elicit interspecific fear and flight responses in receivers [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Distress calls are very specific loud calls emitted when an animal is in a situation of extreme distress, such as when caught by a predator [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They can serve different functions, like warning others about the presence of a predator, calling for help and distracting or mobbing predators [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In birds, distress calls of different species show parallels in acoustic structure and often elicit interspecific responses [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, birds respond significantly stronger to conspecifics&#x02019; distress calls than to those of more distantly related species [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The majority of experiments investigating the reaction to conspecifics&#x02019; calls use mammals, such as goats[<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], horses [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], pigs [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], dogs [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], rodents [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but also lizards have been tested [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In birds, most of the studies have focused on structural [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and functional aspects [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] of distress calls, however, they did not take into account the social bonds between emitters and receivers of these calls.</p><p>The magnitude of an individual&#x02019;s reaction to others&#x02019; behaviours might additionally depend on within-species parameters, such as familiarity (i.e. individuals know each other and can be genetically related or unrelated), or affiliation (i.e. individuals choose to interact preferentially with certain conspecifics). Familiarity can modulate an emotional reaction to conspecific behaviour although there is mixed empirical support for this (e.g. in horses [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], dogs [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and mice [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). While the role of familiarity in emotional contagion has been investigated, few studies have looked at the effect of affiliation, which describes an even stronger social bond than familiarity. Affiliative relationships are commonly described as high quality social bonds between individuals that are not necessarily genetically related [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Individuals sharing an affiliative relationship exchange socio-positive behaviours (e.g. allopreening/allogrooming or allofeeding) and spend time in close spatial proximity [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Affiliation has been shown to have an impact on emotional contagion in primates. In bonobos (<italic>Pan paniscus)</italic> and humans, yawn contagion is higher between individuals sharing affiliative relationships than between non-affiliated individuals [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Up to now, to our knowledge, no study has tested the effect of affiliation on emotional contagion in other taxa than mammals.</p><p>Several bird species like rooks (<italic>Corvus frugilegus</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], jackdaws (<italic>Coloeus monedula</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ravens (<italic>Corvus corax</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and parrots [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] live in individualised societies comparable in complexity to those of primates [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and show similar affiliative association patterns. In birds, affiliative behaviours have been observed between sexual partners [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], siblings [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and unrelated individuals of the same sex [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Affiliative behaviours with mates or non-sexual partners can provide better access to food [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], facilitate coalition formation through cooperation [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or enable consolation following stressful situations [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A few studies have explored emotional arousal and contagion between familiar conspecifics in birds, like geese [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], psittacids [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and corvids [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], all of which form long-term monogamous pair-bonds [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A study found that graylag geese (<italic>Anser anser</italic>) exhibited increased heart rate when they observed the pair partner or a family member engaging in agonistic interactions, while no changes in heart rate occurred when they witnessed fighting between non-affiliated individuals [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Psittacids are interesting candidates to investigate responses to conspecific calls, since it has already been demonstrated that they possess individual vocal signatures [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and are able to recognize others by their voice [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the social domain, parrots are characterised by their complex social life [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], their longevity, their long-term monogamous pair-bonds [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and their ability to cooperate [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and act prosocially [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In the present study, we chose to study the response of cockatiels (<italic>Nymphicus hollandicus</italic>) to distress calls of conspecific affiliative partners and non-partners. Cockatiels are small Australian parakeets that belong to the cockatoo family. They are a highly social species, which form long-term monogamous pair-bonds and live in large fission-fusion flocks [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Like other members of the cockatoo family [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], they exhibit a rich vocal repertoire and seem to be capable of individual vocal recognition.</p><p>To test whether the affiliation between individuals would be reflected in the strength of the behavioural response when confronted with distress calls, we exposed individual birds to two types of distress calls: the distress calls of a partner, a bird with which the subject maintained a strong affiliative bond, and the distress calls of a non-partner, a familiar bird housed in the same aviary without particular relations to the subject. Given the complex affiliative relationships found in these bird species, we predict that affiliation modulates emotional responses to conspecifics&#x02019; behaviour and consequently, that birds would react more intensively to partner&#x02019;s distress calls than to non-partners calls. In order to rule out that the birds&#x02019; reaction was simply driven by a reaction to the sound rather than the emotional valence of the stimuli, a control sound (white noise) was additionally included. We recorded and analysed the behavioural responses of the birds before, during and after playback of the stimuli. We predicted that if the birds recognize the emotional content of the stimuli, they would show stronger responses to the distress calls (i.e. alertness and stress behaviours) than to the artificial control sound. Moreover, if the birds are able to individually recognize the distress calls from their partners and if emotional contagion is affected by affiliation, we predicted that the birds would show the strongest response to distress calls produced by their partners while responding to those of other group members to a lesser degree.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>All the birds were housed in standard conditions approved by the French National authorities. This study complies with French and European legislation for animal care and was approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation Charles Darwin (authorization number 2015031616168767 v6 (APAFIS#344)). Birds were never food deprived during experiments. The stressful event created to obtain distress calls from the birds was kept very short (approximately 1 minute) and was authorized by the authorities.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Subjects and housing conditions</title><p>A flock of ten young cockatiels (6 females and 4 males) aged between 1 and 2 years were used in this study. All birds hatched in captivity and arrived at the Laboratoire &#x000c9;thologie Cognition D&#x000e9;veloppement in Paris-Nanterre University at ca. three months of age. The birds were housed together in an indoor aviary (296 cm x 257 cm x 257cm) with three stainless steel tables (155 cm x 55 cm x 84 cm) covered with Kraft paper, two large perch structures (2 meters long), two triangular bird swings and multiple toys hung from the roof. The room was kept on an automated light-dark cycle (time on: 0800, time off: 1900) with UV daylight tubes with a light spectrum especially adapted for birds (Arcadia Bird lamp T8). The temperature was maintained at 25 C&#x000b0;. Extrudes granules (Nutribird G14), anise sand, fresh fruits, vegetables, as well as bathing and drinking water were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p><p>Birds arrived in the lab in two phases: a pair of siblings (Nephtys and Seth) and the five other unrelated birds (Wala, Sita, Callisto, Viviane and Hermes) arrived in the laboratory in October 2013, while three further unrelated birds (Odin, Skadi and Loki) were acquired one year later, and were introduced to the common aviary in February 2015. Given the acquisition of additional birds at a later point in time, the study was performed in two parts: the first one was conducted with seven birds in December 2014 and the second one with the last three birds in July 2015.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>General experimental procedure</title><p>Each subject was tested with three different stimuli on three separate days: 1) artificial white noise, 2) distress calls from a partner (affiliated individual) and 3) distress calls from a non-partner (sharing no affiliative bond). The conditions and the order of the stimulus presentation were semi-randomised and counterbalanced across the subjects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205314.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The experimental phase was approximately 30 minutes per bird. In order to minimize the separation stress, each day of testing was separated by 4 to 5 days without testing. The first seven birds were tested on the 26<sup>th</sup> of November, 1<sup>st</sup> of December and 5<sup>th</sup> of December 2014, while the three last birds (Loki, Skadi and Odin) were tested on the 22<sup>nd</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup> and 31<sup>st</sup> of July 2015. Birds were tested during the day between 10 am and 5 pm. Birds were tested alone, one at a time, in a sound-proof chamber illuminated with white light to eliminate the possibility of being influenced by the presence of other birds in the room. Each bird was tested with distress calls emitted from individuals of the same sex and age. Because of the bias in sex ratio between subgroups (only one female, Nephtys, in the &#x0201c;siblings&#x0201d; subgroup and only one male, Hermes, in the first unrelated subgroup), calls of these individuals were used several times as non-partners stimuli. Behavioural responses of subjects were recorded with a webcam during the entire 30-minute duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Assessment of affiliative relationships</title><p>All birds were group-housed in the same aviary and thus familiar with each other. In order to create experimental dyads of partners and non-partners for each bird, we determined strong and weak affiliative relationship of each cockatiel in the group. Affiliative relationships were assessed via affiliation indexes based on socio-positive behaviours. In order to monitor the affiliative interactions within the group, videos of twenty-minutes were recorded at three different periods of time: 1) 6 videos in May 2014, six months before the first part of testing, in order to assess the general dynamics of the group; 2) 21 videos in December 2014 and January 2015, following the first part of testing, in order to validate the choice of the experimental dyads, and 3) 18 videos in April 2015, before the second part of testing, in order to establish the experimental dyads for the last three birds. Behavioural observations were recorded using a camera (Sony Handycam HDR-CX410) fixed on a tripod (Vanguard Mak 203) and coded based on the &#x0201c;all occurrences and continuous sampling method&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Videos were analysed using the software VLC media player, version .1.5.</p><p>For each dyad, we constructed an index of affiliation following Silk et al&#x02019;s procedure (2006) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] which was adapted to birds by Boucherie et al (2016) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We used the first set of observations recorded in May 2014 to create partner and non-partner dyads as presented in <xref rid="pone.0205314.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, the second set of observations done in December 2014 for another experiment on food-sharing [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] revealed that the affiliative relationships changed between the first and second sessions of observation. We observed that some affiliations, especially between males, observed in the first session of videos no longer existed in the second session for the seven birds. Consequently, we chose to use the data collected during the last two sessions (i.e. closest in time to the experimental periods) to create the index of affiliation even though relations had slightly evolved. These (small) differences in affiliation between the first and second sessions explain why not always the highest and lowest indexes of affiliation were used to form the dyads. The following behaviours were coded and included in the calculation: the time (in seconds) spent in spatial proximity to another bird (PROX, i.e. distance between two birds was so small that they could touch each other), and affiliative behaviours between birds (i.e. SOL: frequency of solicitation of allopreening; ALO: frequency of allopreening). Allopreening is considered the equivalent to allogrooming in primates. It was coded when a donor preened the receiver&#x02019;s head or back and stopped with the donor lifting its head. A solicitation for allopreening is an easily recognized ritualized posture where one individual bows its neck presenting it to its partner. Solicitation was scored when the bird stopped requesting allopreening by lifting its head.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0205314.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

These calls were obtained from recordings of a stressful event. For this purpose the bird was individually isolated in a cage (41 cm x 24 cm x 29.5 cm) placed in a sound proof chamber away from the aviary. An unfamiliar experimenter (to avoid fear reactions towards their usual experimenter), then inserted his hand in the cage for one minute, wearing a large leather glove. The same leather gloves were used when the birds were handled for medical care and were therefore associated by the birds with being seized. Consequently, birds started to emit alarm calls (i.e. in context of physical restraint) when they saw the glove. These distress calls are characterized by repeated harmonic harsh high-pitched calls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205314.g001">Fig 1</xref> for an exemplary spectrogram).</p><fig id="pone.0205314.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0205314.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p><bold>Spectrogram displaying the first calls from (a) Wala, (b) Sita and (c) Hermes extracted from the distress call sequences used in the experiment</bold>.

Each bird was released back into the aviary immediately after the recording session. One bird never emitted distress calls (Loki) and consequently he could only be tested as subject. Two recording sessions were conducted, one in October 2014 with seven birds, and another one in June 2015 with the remaining three birds.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Preparation of the playback stimuli</title><p>Two types of stimuli were created: distress calls and artificial white noise. Both stimuli were computer-edited using Avisoft SASLab Pro, version 5.0.14 (Raimund Specht, Berlin, Germany).</p><p>In order to create comparable distress call stimuli from each individual, we selected 10 different calls from each bird per stimulus and individually normalized them to 75% with an automatic feature in Avisoft SASLab Pro software, which adjusts the intensity of the different calls. Only calls that were distinctly audible, with no sound saturation or environmental noise (like the sound of birds&#x02019; feet on the cage floor) were used to create the playback stimuli. For gaining playback stimuli comparable in intensity, we recorded all calls on the same day and later clipped them from the original recordings. When possible, we kept consecutive suitable calls (with no saturation or background noises) in the same order with the original silent intervals between them. The goal was to keep the final playback sequence as close to the original distress calls as possible. If we could not obtain 10 calls in a natural sequence, we added calls clipped out randomly from the recordings and placed short silent intervals of different durations (usually less than 1 second) in between. In the end, we were able to obtain 10 calls from 9 out of 10 birds.</p><p>In order to get a final duration of 30 seconds per playback stimulus, we repeated the 10 calls several times. We usually had 4 repetitions of 10 calls per 30 seconds of playback stimulus (with the exception of Seth and Viviane who emitted very long calls and consequently only 3 repetitions of 10 calls per 30 seconds were played back for these birds). The segmentation of each call was achieved with outline syllables parameters on Sound Analysis Pro 2011 software (Frequency range: 22050 Hz, FFT data window: 10 ms, Advance window: 1.5 ms, contour threshold: 10). The final single distress calls exhibited the following characteristics (&#x000b1;SE): mean duration of 502 &#x000b1; 61 ms (range: 296&#x02013;869 ms, n = 9); mean fundamental frequency of 2135 &#x000b1; 114 Hz (range = 1677&#x02013;2543 ms, n = 9), mean frequency of 3478 &#x000b1; 181 Hz (range: 2874&#x02013;4428 ms, n = 9).</p><p>For the broad-band white noise playback stimulus, a continuous audio stimulation lasting 30 seconds (no silence parts inserted) was automatically generated with a feature in AvisoftSASLab Pro software (0&#x02013;22050 Hz).

The birds&#x02019; behaviours was analysed separately for each of the three phases of the experiment (i.e. before, during, after). The following variables were coded: activity (the number of changes from one zone to another), number of calls emitted by the subject, time spent near the loudspeaker (designated as zone 1), and time spent with an erected crest (position 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205314.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). In particular, locomotion (movements from one zone to another), and the avoidance of the zone closest to the loudspeaker, were used to assess the emotional arousal of the birds and their motivation to flight. Vocalizations, on the other hand, are known to reflect emotional states in humans and non-human mammals [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

Regarding the crest position, cockatiels are famous for their crest of feathers on top of their head, they can move when they are stressed or attentive. More generally, birds are known to puff their feathers to express emotional arousal in several contexts, such as during agonistic interactions or stressful events. For example, jackdaws exhibit a &#x0201c;bill-down&#x0201d; posture, which is a threat posture characterized by an erect body position combined with fluffed head and body feathers [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205314.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

We ran a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for each of our four response variables: activity (changes between zones), number of calls emitted, time spent near the loudspeaker (zone 1), and time spent with an erected crest (position 1). Models included the phase (before, during and after the playback stimuli) as fixed effect. Models also included individual identity, day of testing and the interaction between day of testing and order of stimuli as random effects.</p><p>The second objective was to investigate whether birds reacted more to distress calls than to white noise, and whether they responded more strongly to partner calls than to non-partner calls during and after the playback stimuli. For this, we ran two sets of GLMMs only using the data from the &#x0201c;during&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;after&#x0201d; phases. The models included the type of playback stimulus (partner, non-partner, white noise) and the sex of the subject as fixed effects. Interactions could not be tested because the models did not converge. The models included individual identity, day of testing, and the interaction between day of testing and order of stimuli as random effects.</p><p>Finally, we created another set of GLMMs to investigate the birds&#x02019; behavioural responses before the stimuli (&#x0201c;before&#x0201d; phase) to ensure they were calm before playbacks. This set of GLMMs was identical to the second and third sets.</p><p>The &#x02018;activity&#x02019; and &#x02018;number of calls&#x02019; variables followed a Poisson distribution, while the variables &#x02018;time spent near the loudspeaker&#x02019; and &#x02018;duration of an erected crest (position 1)&#x02019; were binomially distributed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205314.s004">S1 File</xref>); hence, we transformed them into binary variables by categorizing data as more or less than half the duration of a phase (i.e. 15 seconds) and used a binomial distribution. The three levels of each factor (i.e. &#x0201c;the phase&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;the type of playback stimulus&#x0201d; variables) were compared to each other by computing post-hoc Tukey tests with the &#x0201c;emmeans&#x0201d; package in R [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

Individual variation</title><p>We observed individual differences between birds, as indicated by the high variance observed for the identity random effect during playback stimulation (activity: 1.69; number of calls: 4.17; zone 1: 1.94; crest 1, variance = 16.99) and after the playback phase (activity: 3.32; number of calls: 5.37; zone 1: 2.09; crest 1: 9.09).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results reveal that cockatiels reacted more intensely (as expressed by the activity of the bird, the number of calls, and the time spent near the loudspeaker and with an erected crest) to distress calls of conspecifics than to control noise. Furthermore, affiliation between birds affected their reaction to the distress calls, as the birds responded more strongly (e.g. stress-related behaviours: high activity, avoidance of the loudspeaker and erected crest) to partners&#x02019; distress calls than to non-partners&#x02019; distress calls. These results indicate that birds&#x02019; reaction to a conspecific&#x02019;s distress call depends on the affiliation they shared with the emitter.</p><p>First, it is important to emphasize that hardly any such stress-induced behaviours were observed before the first playback stimulation (i.e. &#x0201c;before&#x0201d; phase), suggesting that social isolation in itself or the handling at the beginning of the experiment did not elicit any observable arousal. Before the first playback stimulus, the birds were not very active, did not emit a single call and exhibited a crest in position 3 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205314.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). They typically sat calmly on the floor and appeared sleepy at the end of the &#x0201c;before&#x0201d; phase preceding the playback. It may be assumed that this sleepiness could have been a consequence of the stress they felt before the beginning of the experiment when handled, as it has been observed in budgerigars (<italic>Melopsittacus undulatus</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Stress-related behaviours were mostly exhibited during playback stimulations and, to a lesser extent, after these playbacks. This means that audio stimulations elicited a very quick, but prolonged, behavioural response in the receivers.</p><p>Our most important result is that cockatiels&#x02019; reaction to their conspecific distress calls was influenced by the degree of affiliation they shared. Cockatiels spent less time near the loudspeaker, spent more time with an erected crest and tended to be more active when hearing distress calls emitted by a conspecific with which they maintained a strong affiliative bond in comparison to distress calls emitted by a familiar bird housed in the same aviary but without affiliation to the subject. These results suggest that distress calls convey emotional information in cockatiels and that affiliation further modulates emotional response to the vocalization. Similar results were obtained in females geladas baboons (<italic>Theropithecus gelada</italic>) in which the contagiousness of yawning correlated with affiliation and the level of grooming contact between partners [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, this is the first study, to our knowledge, showing that affiliation modulates emotional response in birds. Ravens have been shown to respond differently to the playbacks of conspecifics&#x02019; calls depending on the valence of their relationships with the emitter of the calls [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, this study focused on the ravens&#x02019; memory for conspecific calls rather than emotional responses per se.</p><p>It is important to underline that we used a control sound (white noise) to ensure the birds&#x02019; reaction to distress calls was driven by the emotional valence of the stimuli rather than by the sound itself. The control sound did not elicit a similarly strong behavioural reaction during and following the stimulus presentation in comparison to the distress calls. Indeed, birds were less active, emitted less calls, spent more time near the loudspeaker and less time with their crest erected during and after (except for the crest position) the presentation of the control sound in comparison to distress calls. Similar results have been obtained in domestic dogs (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>) which exhibited more stress-related behaviours when exposed to conspecifics&#x02019; whines than when hearing control stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Regarding activity, similar results have been found in another bird species, the Indian mynahs (<italic>Acridotheres tristis</italic>) which increased its flight and walking rates when exposed to a taxidermic model hawk and the associated distress calls from conspecifics, as compared to blank controls trials [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. This increase in locomotor activity may reflect their motivation to escape because distress calls are known to elicit strong aversive reactions and immediate flight responses e.g. used in airports to scare away birds from aircrafts [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. However, some bird and bat species&#x02019; distress calls alert conspecifics while also triggering their mobbing behaviour, thus attracting conspecifics [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In the present study, the subjects significantly avoided the loudspeaker during the playback of distress calls, but not white noise, which suggests an aversive reaction to the distress calls, potentially resulting in flight behaviour rather than mobbing behaviour.</p><p>One of the limits in this study may be the use of white noise as a control instead of a social stimulus. We thought about using different type of control sounds like calls from cockatiels recorded in their aviary without the birds being stressed. But these controls would have been problematic due to several possible uncontrollable confounding factors. By using the white noise, our goal was to use an artificial noise, not emitted by any living bird and with no emotional meaning at all. Even if we used a call of a cockatiel outside any stressful context, we doubted that this sound would be perceived as &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; by the receiver. Indeed, even social vocalizations emitted in the aviary during a peaceful moment likely have a meaning that is unknown to us. Consequently, we kept the white noise as a neutral control which has been used in a previous study similar to ours [<xref rid="pone.0205314.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To summarize, cockatiels reacted more strongly to conspecific&#x02019;s distress calls compared to a control sound. Interestingly, they reacted differently depending on the identity of the emitter and the degree of affiliation between them (e.g. activity, avoidance of the loudspeaker and crest erection). These results suggest that distress calls convey emotional information in cockatiels and that affiliation further modulates emotional contagion of the vocalization. Additionally, we could establish the position of the crest feathers as a meaningful indicator for attentiveness and emotional arousal in cockatiels. Although we exclusively focused on negatively valued calls, our results suggest that it may be promising to further assess emotional contagion and empathy in psittacids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205314.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Supporting data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205314.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205314.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Randomization of conditions depending on the subjects and the days of testing.</title><p>P: Partner, NP: Non-partner, WN: White Noise.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205314.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205314.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the crest positions.</title><p>Crest 1 position is characteristic of a stressed or attentive bird, with clearly separated feathers.
