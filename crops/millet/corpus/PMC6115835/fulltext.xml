In low-income countries, maternal diets are often limited, and daily nutrient supplements are recommended to fill nutrient gaps. As a result, it is important to understand the factors influencing acceptability and utilization of nutrient supplements in these settings. Qualitative data (individual interviews and focus group discussions with pregnant women, household members, and study staff) and quantitative data (unannounced household spot checks) were collected in 24 villages in the Maradi region of south-central Niger. Each village was randomly assigned to one of three study arms, with pregnant women receiving either iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements, multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplements, or medium-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (MQ-LNS) for daily consumption during pregnancy. Data were collected longitudinally to capture changes in perspective as women progressed through their pregnancy. Participants accepted all three supplement types, and perceived a wide range of health benefits attributed to supplement consumption. However, several important barriers to appropriate consumption were reported, and rumors about the supplements leading to childbirth complications also decreased utilization. The household spot checks suggested that IFA had the highest level of correct consumption. Overall, despite a stated high level of acceptance and enthusiasm for the supplements among participants and their household members, certain fears, side effects, and organoleptic factors led to decreased utilization. The effectiveness of future programs to improve maternal nutritional status through supplementation may be improved by understanding perceived barriers and facilitating factors among participants and tailoring communication efforts appropriately.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>maternal nutrition</kwd><kwd>pregnancy outcomes</kwd><kwd>prenatal supplement</kwd><kwd>Niger</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>qualitative methods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-10-01073"><title>1.

However, traditional diets in many low-income countries are suboptimal, and additional individual and socio-cultural factors, such as food aversions and &#x0201c;eating down&#x0201d; in pregnancy [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], can further reduce intake in pregnancy. Nutrient supplements can help fill this gap and may improve pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends daily iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation in pregnancy [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but coverage in most countries remains low. In 2012, only 28.6% of women in Niger reported consuming iron for 90 or more days during their most recent pregnancy [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplements have been shown to be more effective than IFA alone on improving birth outcomes [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but it is not yet recommended by the WHO as the standard of care [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and utilization remains low. Lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) are another emerging option for prenatal nutritional supplementation, providing protein and energy as well as micronutrients, but are rarely used outside of experimental contexts [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. All three supplements must be consumed on a daily basis throughout pregnancy to optimize effectiveness; as a result, understanding factors influencing acceptability and utilization of these supplements by pregnant women remains a crucial component to improving maternal health outcomes.</p><p>Previous qualitative and mixed-methods studies have been conducted on the acceptability and utilization of IFA [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], MMN [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and LNS [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in community settings in low-income countries. Measured levels of adherence to supplementation protocol have varied widely in these studies, from 95% in Mali [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to 47% in Cambodia [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A large number of individual and program-related factors have been identified as influencing adherence, including organoleptic properties of the supplements [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], provision of the supplement at no cost [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], reminders to take the supplement [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and perceptions of supplement benefits [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-10-01073"><title>2.1. Study Site and Population</title><p>This study was conducted within an ongoing randomized trial designed to assess the effectiveness of three prenatal supplements to improve infant immune response to rotavirus vaccination (<uri>ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> Identifier: NCT02145000) [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The study took place in the Madarounfa Health District within Maradi region, a rural area in south-central Niger along the Nigerian border. Nutritional outcomes in the region are poor. According to the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 17.9% of women of reproductive age were underweight (body-mass index of &#x0003c;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 53.5% of children under five were stunted (&#x0003c;&#x02212;2 <italic>z</italic>-score in height-for-age), both of which were worse than the national average rates for Niger [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Villages in the parent study (<italic>n</italic> = 53) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 allocation to one of the three study arms (IFA, MMN, or LNS). Pregnancy surveillance was conducted among all consenting non-pregnant women of reproductive age, and women who became pregnant and met inclusion criteria were enrolled to receive supplementation until the end of their pregnancy (approximately 6 months). Participants meeting inclusion criteria were less than 30 weeks gestation at the time of enrollment; intended to remain in the study area through delivery and for 2 years thereafter; and did not have a chronic health condition, severe illness, evident pregnancy complications, or peanut allergy. All participants received free antenatal care provided by the study as per the national protocol.</p><p>A mixed-methods sub-study to assess acceptability and utilization of the supplements included pregnant women, as well as household and community members, from 24 villages participating in the parent study. These villages, and the specific participants selected for data collection, were selected using criterion-based purposive sampling [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in order to gather a representative sample of participants&#x02019; views, based on pre-established criteria that were believed to be important based on the literature (including maternal age, gestational age, and supplement type). Sample size ranges were chosen based on estimates of the number of participants needed to reach data saturation [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants (as well as their husband or father if the participant was less than 18 years of age).

Study Intervention</title><p>The IFA group received tablets containing 60 mg iron and 400 &#x000b5;g folic acid, according to the national guidelines of Niger. The tablets were red and came in a blister pack of 10 tablets. Participants were instructed to take one tablet daily, with water after the evening meal. The MMN group received gel capsules containing a white powder, with a daily dose (four capsules) containing 30 mg iron, 400 &#x000b5;g folic acid, and 20 other micronutrients. They received a plastic bottle containing 40 capsules and were instructed to take two in the morning and two in the evening, with water and after meals. The LNS group received 40 g of a fortified, ready-to-use food made of peanuts, oil, dried skimmed milk powder, sugar, and the same 22 micronutrients as the MMN group. Because of its size, this product was classified as a medium-quantity LNS (MQ-LNS) and will henceforth be referred to as such [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The MQ-LNS group received 10 individual foil sachets of MQ-LNS, and were instructed to take one a day, either alone or mixed with already prepared family foods. The detailed nutritional composition of the supplements is available in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-10-01073">Table S1</xref>. </p><p>The supplements and instructions for use and household storage were presented by a study midwife at the time of enrollment. Health assistants conducted weekly home visits to distribute a 10-day supply of the supplement (7 days&#x02019; supply to be consumed, plus 3 days&#x02019; extra supply in case of loss or damage, otherwise to be returned to the health assistant at the next distribution). At the weekly home visits, the health assistants reviewed supplement adherence and discussed other health events or concerns with the study participants. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-10-01073"><title>2.3. Study Design and Data Collection</title><p>This was a two-phase, longitudinal study with emergent design, in which Phase 2 data collection built off findings from Phase 1. We collected quantitative and qualitative data to compare the acceptability and utilization of the three supplement types, as well as to understand the factors influencing acceptability and utilization among participants. The number of interviews, focus groups, and spot checks conducted by participant type, study arm, and study phase are shown in <xref rid="nutrients-10-01073-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. </p><p>Qualitative and spot check data were collected by study staff who were trained in qualitative research methods and not involved in supplement distribution. Semi-structured interview and focus group guides covered supplement acceptability, consumption practices, facilitating factors and barriers, perceived side effects, perceived benefits, support or opposition from household members (e.g., husbands and in-laws), and the supplement delivery mechanism. In anticipation of the sensitive nature of the questions, or the potential for respondents to hesitate to share negative comments or practices, the interviewers were trained to ask respondents to share experiences of other women that they might be aware of, as well as their own experiences. Data were collected in two different phases (July&#x02013;August 2016 and November&#x02013;December 2016) to allow for a longitudinal analysis that would capture changes in perspective as women progressed through their pregnancy and gained experience with the supplements. Interviewers were also asked to give a numerical Likert scale rating of both acceptability and utilization (each on a 0 to 10 scale, with 10 being the best) with textual field notes for further triangulation of data from the interviewers&#x02019; perspective. </p><p>In Phase 1, semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with participating women at various gestational ages (<italic>n</italic> = 84 interviews and 17 focus groups), their husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 18 interviews) and mothers-in-law (<italic>n</italic> = 9 interviews), and study staff (midwives, <italic>n</italic> = 3 interviewers, and health assistants, <italic>n</italic> = 9 focus groups). Women in their first, second, and third trimesters were purposively sampled in Phase 1. In Phase 2, individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with participating women in the third trimester of their pregnancy or who had recently delivered (<italic>n</italic> = 39 interviews and 12 focus groups). These were re-interviews of women who had participated in Phase 1, in order to generate an understanding of change in women&#x02019;s attitudes and experiences with supplement consumption over the course of the pregnancy.</p><p>Household spot checks were conducted in Phase 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 90) and Phase 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 50) in order to count the number of supplements on hand and to calculate supplement adherence. Spot checks were unannounced and conducted after the completion of an interview by asking to see the household stock of supplements. A convenience sampling method was used for spot checks, from among participants already selected for interviews or focus groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-nutrients-10-01073"><title>2.4. Data Analysis</title><p>Interviews and focus groups were conducted in the local language (Hausa), then transcribed verbatim and translated into English. The English transcripts were uploaded into Dedoose software [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for data management and analysis. The transcripts were coded using an inductive approach, drawing from aspects of Grounded Theory [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this approach, rather than using a pre-determined codebook, an exhaustive list of codes was established through the analysis of participant transcripts. These codes were subsequently grouped into emergent themes and categories in order to determine the most salient findings and the frequency with which they appeared in each of the three study arms. In addition, coded text was displayed in a thematic matrix and stratified by study arm, gestational age, and interviewer ratings for enhanced pattern identification [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>For quantitative analysis of the spot check data, the expected number of supplements was calculated based on the number of days elapsed since the last distribution, which was then compared to the actual number observed during the spot check. For the purposes of this analysis, correct consumption was defined as the actual number being no more than 2 days&#x02019; worth of supplements above or below the expected number (i.e., within two tablets or sachets for IFA and MQ-LNS, and within eight capsules for MMN). If the actual number exceeded the expected, this was considered &#x0201c;under-consumption&#x0201d;, and if the actual number was less than expected, this was considered &#x0201c;over-consumption&#x0201d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-nutrients-10-01073"><title>3.

Typical Utilization</title><p>Women did not report significant problems with IFA consumption; they typically swallowed it with water or with <italic>fura</italic> (a millet-based porridge mixed with milk). Most women took the tablet in the morning after their breakfast, although some took it in the evening to avoid morning sickness early in pregnancy.

<disp-quote><p>Early in the morning after I take my breakfast I will open the capsule of the supplement and take two supplements, and likewise in the evening &#x02026; We have heard the layer that covers the supplement does not dissolve in the body; that is why I remove it before I take the supplement &#x02026; We are removing the capsule then pouring the solid medicine into water for consuming.</p><attrib><italic>(Pregnant woman, MMN group, Phase 2, ID#47)</italic></attrib></disp-quote></p><p>There was a strong consensus that the IFA and MMN supplements should not be taken on an empty stomach. This appeared to be due to instructions from the study team at supplement distribution that advised taking it with food, as well as general beliefs around the consumption of other medications (e.g., malaria treatment).</p><p>Most women chose to consume the MQ-LNS alone, or less commonly to mix it with porridge. Some women mixed it with sugar or with other foods in order to avoid the taste of the MQ-LNS.

Perceived Benefits</title><p>Participants in all three groups most commonly reported increased appetite during pregnancy, more strength and energy to do household chores, and overall improved health (prevention of pregnancy illnesses) as the most important benefits to themselves. Consumption was also perceived to lead to safe delivery of a healthy baby, which would be evident from the baby&#x02019;s large size (frequently contrasted with small, &#x0201c;malnourished&#x0201d; babies), good complexion and smooth skin, and absence of diseases such as diarrhea and fever.

This appeared to be a facilitating factor in encouraging supplement adherence.

<disp-quote><p>Yes, the supplement is easy to consume. Also, it makes a delivery easier for the pregnant woman that consumes it. For instance, my neighbor gave birth to a baby girl two weeks ago. The baby looks very big and healthy. The mother also told me that she delivered the baby in a very short period of time and she thinks it is the supplement that made it easier for her to deliver.

For MQ-LNS, many women disliked its taste, reporting it as &#x0201c;bitter&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;not sweet,&#x0201d; while others reported enjoying the &#x0201c;sweetness&#x0201d; of the product; this seemed to be a matter of personal preference and the level of food sensitivities experienced in pregnancy. It may also have been related to past exposure to Plumpy&#x02019;Nut, a ready-to-use therapeutic food used in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition among children, which is significantly sweeter than the MQ-LNS developed for adult women in this study.

<disp-quote><p>At first, there are some people in this community that tried so hard to see that pregnant women didn&#x02019;t use the supplement. They went on spreading rumors that the supplement will cause nothing but harm to the people of this community; they also tried to scare us off the supplement by telling us all sort of lies that the doctors use to remove some liters of blood from the body, and they also said that the doctors use to cause miscarriage for the women. They also said that it is a male doctor that does the diagnosis [including vaginal exam].</p><attrib><italic>(Pregnant woman, MMN group, Phase 1, ID#116)</italic></attrib></disp-quote></p><p>By far the most commonly cited rumor was that taking the supplements would cause the fetus to grow too big, leading to a painful delivery or complications.

Some women reported consuming more than one sachet per day if they were hungry. Many reported sharing MQ-LNS with household members, particularly with small children who would &#x0201c;cry&#x0201d; if they saw the supplement being consumed in their presence without receiving at least a taste.

Although no participants admitted to doing so themselves, a few reported that other women in their communities sold their MQ-LNS sachets in the market for cash.
<disp-quote><p>Some just take it as a business, especially the LNS, thinking that it is a nutritional supplement for malnourished children, and they sell it 25 CFA or 50 CFA [US $0.04 to $0.09].

However, they appeared to feel more comfortable reporting they knew &#x0201c;other women&#x0201d; who chose not to consume the supplements, instead throwing them away or feeding them to farm animals. Mentioning the behavior of others appeared to be an important way to express lack of acceptability and poor utilization in the community.</p><p>With the exception of the fear of excessively large babies, which appeared to be widespread, many women were reluctant to admit that they themselves believed or were influenced by rumors about the supplements or the parent study. Others actively rebutted these rumors based on their own positive experiences. However, they readily acknowledged that the rumors were present in their communities.
<disp-quote><p>You will see that, especially for new programs, people will be saying different things about that program for some time. In the village, people were saying that the supplement will result in the death of the baby.

So these are just rumors, because since I started taking the supplement I have become healthy and I have seen many other successfully delivering a healthy baby.

Discussion</title><p>The three nutrient supplements used in this study appeared to be well accepted by the participants, their household members, and their communities. Participants attributed a wide range of benefits to the supplements that were relatively consistent across all three study arms. During pregnancy, the most valued benefits were increased appetite to consume an adequate diet, increased strength to do household chores, and prevention of disease. The supplements were also believed to improve the chances of a safe and uncomplicated delivery of a healthy, well-nourished baby. Utilization, assessed through household spot checks, suggested adherence may not have been consistently correct but was most likely with IFA, while MMN tended to be under-consumed and MQ-LNS over-consumed. Reported acceptability of all three supplement types increased among women later in their pregnancies (Phase 2 interviews), seemingly due to decreased morning sickness and nausea symptoms, as well as participants &#x0201c;getting used to&#x0201d; the supplements.</p><p>There were several barriers identified that may have reduced appropriate utilization. For both IFA and MMN, participants strongly felt that the supplements should not be taken on an empty stomach (both due to messaging from study staff and a general belief that this is true for all medications), which led to skipping doses, particularly during fasting for Ramadan and on days where the household did not have food available. For MMN, the large size of the capsule made it difficult to swallow, although many women adopted the alternative approach of opening the capsule and mixing the powder with food or water. For MQ-LNS, sharing of the supplement with household members, particularly small children, was a significant factor. Some women reported hiding the supplement in a secure place, and consuming it only when alone, in order to address this issue. Understanding these barriers and the coping mechanisms developed by participants is important for developing methods to increase adherence in future programs.</p><p>The supplementation program was perceived positively overall, particularly due to the high level of trust in medical providers in this study setting. In addition to women&#x02019;s approval, the study had a high level of support among the men of the community. This is important given the role of husbands as the chief household decision-maker, whose permission was necessary for women to take part. However, some participants and community members remained wary due to prevalent rumors circulating about the study and the supplements. In particular, fear of an invasive vaginal exam (possibly to be carried out by a male doctor) and exaggerated descriptions of up to a liter of blood being drawn led some women to avoid antenatal care and the study enrollment visits. The supplements themselves were feared to cause babies to grow too big, leading to the need for delivery by Cesarean section. Although many participants dismissed this concern, saying that Cesarean sections had existed before the supplement program began and that the size of babies was &#x0201c;God&#x02019;s will,&#x0201d; it is possible that these rumors played some role in reduced utilization.</p><p>The quantitative data from the household spot checks supported the conclusion that the various barriers cited above led to decreased adherence. IFA had the highest percentage of &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; consumption in the spot checks, but still tended toward under-consumption, likely due to the more generalized fears about blood loss in childbirth and excessively big babies. MMN tended strongly to under-consumption, in accordance with the fact that women found the large capsules difficult to consume. MQ-LNS was most frequently over-consumed, likely due to its perception as a food substitute. Some women reported eating more than one per day if they felt hungry, or sharing with children and other household members. The percentage of correct consumption increased for all three supplement types from Phase 1 to Phase 2, suggesting an improvement in adherence with later gestational age.</p><p>The salient themes from this study are consistent with previous research on prenatal supplement acceptability and adherence in West Africa. Past studies have found a high level of utilization, particularly when supplements are provided free of charge [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and women receive adequate counseling from healthcare providers [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Comparisons between supplement types, however, have shown varying results. In Mali, adherence to MMN was found to be significantly higher than to IFA [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however, in this case, both supplements were delivered in a single daily pill (unlike the present study, in which the four large MMN capsules per day may have acted as a deterrent). In a multi-site study of LNS where comparison groups received either MMN or IFA, adherence to IFA/MMN was significantly higher than LNS in Ghana, while all three were equivalent in Malawi [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sharing of LNS products among household members has been documented in the literature [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Barriers to supplement adherence including side effects, organoleptic properties, and pregnancy-related nausea have been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but the fears of childbirth complications&#x02014;which were highly prevalent among this population in Niger&#x02014;do not appear to be discussed in other prenatal supplementation studies.</p><p>One notable strength of the present study is the longitudinal, mixed-methods design, which to our knowledge has been use only once elsewhere [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This combination of unannounced spot checks, interviews, and focus group discussions allowed for a unique extension of qualitative data on self-reported supplement consumption behaviors. In addition, few previous studies have examined social and familial factors influencing women&#x02019;s supplementation practices [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and no study was identified that interviewed husbands and mothers-in-law to directly gather their perceptions. (One recent retrospective study interviewed husbands and wives together about past experiences with prenatal supplementation [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].) Another strength is the criterion-based purposive sampling strategy, which allowed strategic gathering of information from study participants based on personal and program characteristics (e.g., gestational age) for comparison across groups. However, this study has several limitations. Because the interviewers were known by participants to be study employees, it is likely that participants were less willing to share negative feedback or admit that they were not fully adhering to supplementation. Social desirability bias may have also played a role in participants&#x02019; unwillingness to report non-adherence [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-10-01073" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, women did seem willing to report general rumors and issues in the community, as well as problems encountered by &#x0201c;other women&#x0201d; they knew. Finally, this study was not intended to quantitatively assess compliance; however, compliance has been assessed in the full trial population (forthcoming).</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-10-01073"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Despite a stated high level of acceptance and enthusiasm for the supplements among participants and their household members, it is clear that certain fears, side effects, and organoleptic factors impacted utilization. Appropriate messaging to overcome these barriers should be an essential part of any future program that includes prenatal supplementation. For example, addressing rumors about antenatal care and childbirth complications may help to dispel misconceptions and build on the already high level of trust in the medical system; sharing alternative ways of consuming the supplements that other women have found helpful may increase adherence; and emphasizing that supplements can be consumed on an empty stomach if necessary may decrease skipping in an environment of high food insecurity and periodic religious fasting. Husbands, as the key decision-makers in the family setting, should be engaged along with women in these communication efforts.</p><p>This study indicates the continued importance of formative and implementation research to understand factors influencing the beliefs and behaviors of pregnant women, as well as household and community members and health staff around them. In order to improve nutritional status and pregnancy outcomes, supplementation programs should take these factors into account to ensure the intervention is well accepted and taken up by participants.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Canice Ahearn and Meagan Harrison for their assistance with interview coding, and the Epicentre Maradi team members for support of field activities.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-10-01073"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/8/1073/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/8/1073/s1</uri>, Table S1: Nutritional composition of study supplements.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="nutrients-10-01073-s001"><media xlink:href="nutrients-10-01073-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, S.I., S.R.K., and R.F.G.; Methodology, S.R.K.; Validation, S.I. and R.F.G.; Formal Analysis, A.C. and J.R.; Investigation, S.R.K., A.M.S., A.S.; Resources, A.M.S. and A.S.; Data Curation, A.C. and J.R.; Writing&#x02014;Original Draft Preparation, A.C.; Writing&#x02014;Review &#x00026; Editing, A.C., S.R.K., A.M.S., A.S., J.R., R.F.G., and S.I.; Visualization, A.C.; Supervision, S.I.; Project Administration, S.I.; Funding Acquisition, R.F.G.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res-Operational Center, Geneva; Kavli Foundation, Norway.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.
