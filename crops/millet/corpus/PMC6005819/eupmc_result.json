    "The aim of this study was to assess the performance of different kinematic features measured by foot-worn inertial sensors for detecting running gait temporal events (e.g., initial contact, terminal contact) in order to estimate inner-stride phases duration (e.g., contact time, flight time, swing time, step time). Forty-one healthy adults ran multiple trials on an instrumented treadmill while wearing one inertial measurement unit on the dorsum of each foot. Different algorithms for the detection of initial contact and terminal contact were proposed, evaluated and compared with a reference-threshold on the vertical ground reaction force. The minimum of the pitch angular velocity within the first and second half of a mid-swing to mid-swing cycle were identified as the most precise features for initial and terminal contact detection with an inter-trial median ± IQR precision of 2 ± 1 ms and 4 ± 2 ms respectively. Using these initial and terminal contact features, this study showed that the ground contact time, flight time, step and swing time can be estimated with an inter-trial median ± IQR bias less than 12 ± 10 ms and the a precision less than 4 ± 3 ms. Finally, this study showed that the running speed can significantly affect the biases of the estimations, suggesting that a speed-dependent correction should be applied to improve the system's accuracy."
