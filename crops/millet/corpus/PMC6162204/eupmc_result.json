    "Plants contain a number of bioactive compounds that exhibit antimicrobial activity, which can be recognized as an important source of agrochemicals for plant disease control. As part of our search for new antimicrobial agents from natural sources, we found that a crude methanol extract of Trevesia palmata exhibited a promising antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi, such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Botrytis cinerea. Furthermore, based on activity-guided fractionation, we isolated five antifungal compounds from the methanol extract of T. palmata: two new triterpene glycosides (TPGs), TPG1 (hederagenin-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1  → 3)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-α-L-arabinopyranoside) and TPG5 (3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl asiatic acid), along with three known TPGs (TPG2 [macranthoside A], TPG3 [α-hederin], and TPG4 [ilekudinoside D]). The chemical structures of the TPGs were determined by spectroscopic analyses and by comparison with literature data. An in vitro antifungal bioassay revealed that except for TPG4 (ilekudinoside D; IC50 >256 μg/ml), the other TPGs exhibited strong antifungal activities against the rice blast pathogen M. oryzae with IC50 values ranging from 2-5 μg/ml. In particular, when the plants were treated with compound TPG1 (500 μg/ml), disease control values against rice blast, tomato grey mold, tomato late blight, and wheat leaf rust were 84, 82, 88, and 70%, respectively, compared to the non-treatment control. Considering the in vitro and in vivo antifungal activities of the TPGs and the T. palmata methanol extracts, our results suggest that T. palmata can be a useful source to develop new natural fungicides."
