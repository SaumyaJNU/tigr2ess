Between 2004 and 2011, the market for gluten-free products grew at an annual rate of 28% (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), with an estimated $2.6 billion in sales in 2012 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) that is expected to reach $6.6 billion by 2017 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A 2013 survey from NPD (formerly National Purchase Diary, a market research group) found that 30% of Americans showed interest in avoiding gluten (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Also in 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the final rule on gluten-free food labeling, effective in August 2014 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), making the gluten-free label a more common sight in the grocery store.</p><p>Although the gluten-free diet is an absolute necessity for people with celiac disease or nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), people without diagnosed gluten issues are trying the diet to assist in the management of other medical issues. A 2013 study found that 65% of American adults think gluten-free foods are healthier, and 27% choose gluten-free products to aid in weight loss (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>There is a well-established relationship between type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. But for those with diabetes who have not been diagnosed with either celiac disease or NCGS, is there a benefit to going gluten-free? Are there risks to eating gluten-free without a diagnosis of celiac disease or NCGS? What special challenges exist for those with concurrent diabetes and celiac disease or NCGS? And finally, how can patients improve the nutritional profile of the gluten-free diet in terms of fiber, iron, calcium, and vitamin D to address deficiencies created by celiac disease or by the gluten-free diet?</p><sec id="s1"><title>Celiac Disease Defined</title><p>Celiac disease is an inherited autoimmune condition that affects &#x0223c;1% of the population, although for every case diagnosed, it is thought that 5&#x02013;10 cases remain undiagnosed (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The consumption of gluten from wheat and related prolamins from barley and rye causes damage to the villi of the small intestine. This damage results in malabsorption of nutrients (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Adult patients may present with gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, and constipation. They may also present with extra-intestinal symptoms such as iron deficiency anemia, reduced bone density or osteoporosis, infertility, miscarriage, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), depression, elevated liver enzymes, neuropathy, and headaches (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Pediatric patients may present with unexplained growth failure or failure to thrive, short stature, diarrhea, delayed puberty, and iron deficiency anemia (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Diagnosis: Not Putting the Cart Before the Horse</title><p>Serology studies are the first step in determining diagnosis, specifically the serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies. Patients should also be screened for total IgA because this affects the reliability of the TTG test (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These are accurate and inexpensive tests; however, it is very important to note that patients must be on a gluten-containing diet at the time of testing to avoid false negative results. This has become more of a problem in clinical practice because patients may present to their health care provider after several months or even years on the gluten-free diet. This can lead to a diagnostic conundrum for the provider and patient. To obtain accurate antibody results, patients must complete a &#x0201c;gluten challenge,&#x0201d; in which they consume a specified amount of gluten-containing foods for several weeks (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). For patients who have obtained symptom relief with the gluten-free diet, returning to a gluten-containing diet may be undesirable. This can leave such patients without a clear diagnosis.</p><p>Genetic tests can be helpful in those who are already following the gluten-free diet; however, these tests cannot diagnose celiac disease on their own. About 40% of the general population carry the genes responsible for celiac disease, but most never develop the disease (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, individuals with type 1 diabetes can have temporary elevations in the antibodies for celiac disease (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For this reason, it is important to confirm serology with a small bowel biopsy, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes who may not show typical celiac disease symptoms (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease</title><p>The prevalence of celiac disease is increased in those with other autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. The prevalence of celiac disease in people with type 1 diabetes is estimated to be between 1.4 and 19.7% (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The common denominators in both conditions are the <italic>HLA DQ2</italic> and <italic>HLA DQ8</italic> genes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); however, environmental factors such as infections, infant feeding practices, and breastfeeding may play a role, although to what extent is unknown (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, there is emerging research into the potential role of the gut microbiome (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In children, a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes typically precedes the diagnosis of celiac disease, and the celiac disease diagnosis most often occurs within 5 years of the diabetes diagnosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Children with type 1 diabetes may not present with typical gastrointestinal celiac disease symptoms, but rather may still show growth failure and delay in puberty (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A typical gastrointestinal presentation in those with type 1 diabetes is actually the exception, occurring in &#x0003c;10% of patients. More often, people with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease are asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For this reason, patients with type 1 diabetes should be screened for celiac disease at the time of diabetes diagnosis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The timeline for follow-up screening for celiac disease remains controversial, but all agree that those with type 1 diabetes should be screened at regular intervals, either annually or biannually (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Mass screening of the general population for celiac disease is not currently recommended (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Adult patients with new onset type 1 diabetes may be even more likely to develop celiac disease. Bakker et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found that 42% of those with adult-onset type 1 diabetes developed celiac disease 10 years after diagnosis. A delay in celiac disease diagnosis may occur in adults, whose gastrointestinal symptoms may be incorrectly attributed to neuropathy (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). One study found that 48% of adult patients with type 1 diabetes had been symptomatic for &#x0003e;5 years before being diagnosed with celiac disease (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>There does not appear to be a link between type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and the development of celiac disease. One study showed a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in those with celiac disease, even after controlling for BMI, which was significantly lower in those with celiac disease (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Some smaller studies suggest that patients with both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease may derive benefit in the prevention of some diabetes complications by adopting the gluten-free diet, although the research remains conflicted. For example, one study found a lower risk of retinopathy for those with diagnosed celiac disease (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), whereas another found an increased risk of retinopathy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Picarelli et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) found that those with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease may have reduced cholesterol levels, lower A1C values, and lower rates of retinopathy and nephropathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Possible Risks of Eating Gluten-Free in the Absence of Celiac Disease</title><p>A 2015 study that reviewed records of patients presenting for evaluation in celiac disease clinics found that 11% had at some point avoided gluten without a diagnosis of celiac disease. Reasons given for adopting the gluten-free diet included lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). A 2012 study of 579 children and adolescents found that 7.4% were avoiding gluten without a celiac disease diagnosis. The study found that the strongest predictors of participants following the gluten-free diet included irritability, family history of celiac disease, bowel movement changes, diarrhea, and autism (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Some evidence indicates that there are significant drawbacks to following the gluten-free diet. For example, gluten-free processed grain products (e.g., breads, cereals, and crackers) are often lower in fiber, iron, zinc, and potassium (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The gluten-free diet also may increase the risks for nutritional deficiencies, especially in B vitamins, iron, and trace minerals (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In addition, gluten-free products continue to be significantly more expensive. A 2015 study found that gluten-free bread and bakery products were on average 267% more expensive than gluten-containing breads, and gluten-free cereals were found to be 205% more expensive than gluten-containing cereals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Individuals following the gluten-free diet also may fail to adhere to recommendations regarding daily servings of grain products. One study found that 38% of patients with celiac disease included no grain or starch choice at meals; when patients did choose a grain product, 44% most frequently chose rice (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In another survey of people with celiac disease, 80% were eating less than half of the recommended daily amount of grains, and only 1.1% ate the six recommended servings each day. Of those who did eat grain products, 61% most frequently chose rice and corn (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><sec id="s5"><title>Weighty Matters</title><p>Although the gluten-free diet has been purported to aid in weight loss (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), for those with celiac disease, it may actually cause weight gain. For some, this can be desirable, particularly if weight loss was a symptom preceding diagnosis. But for others, the gluten-free diet may exacerbate existing overweight or obesity. In a study of adults with celiac disease, weight gain occurred in 27% of already overweight or obese patients (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This effect was also found in children; a study of children on the gluten-free diet for at least 1 year found that the proportion of overweight children rose from 11 to 21% (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>The reasons for weight gain in those with celiac disease include improved absorption of nutrients and improvement in abdominal symptoms. Gluten-free foods often are higher in fat and calories than their gluten-containing counterparts while also being lower in fiber and whole grains (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A 2010 study showed that women on the gluten-free diet consumed significantly more carbohydrates, protein, and fat compared to control subjects, and men consumed more carbohydrates and fat. Both groups showed a lower intake of dietary fiber (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). There are no published studies on the benefits of the gluten-free diet on the weight status of those without celiac disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>The Gluten-Free Diet for Life</title><p>Currently, following the gluten-free diet for life is the only treatment for celiac disease, although medications may become available in the future (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The gluten-free diet involves the complete avoidance of wheat, rye, barley, and regular oats. Specialty gluten-free oats are tolerated by the majority of people with celiac disease (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In addition, those following the gluten-free diet must take special care to avoid gluten contamination of food in their home kitchens, restaurants, and workplaces. Obvious foods to avoid include regular bread products, pasta, pizza, and cereals. However, gluten also may show up unexpectedly in foods such as soy sauce, canned soups, licorice, imitation crab meats, broth, beer, and products made with malt vinegar, malt flavoring, or malt extract.</p><p>People with diabetes should also check all medications they take to ensure that they do not contain gluten as an excipient ingredient. This can be done with the help of a knowledgeable pharmacist or through various websites, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glutenfreedrugs.com">www.glutenfreedrugs.com</ext-link>. In addition, it is important to use gluten-free products to treat low blood glucose (i.e., glucose gels or tablets). Gluten information can be found on manufacturer websites or on the product packaging.</p><p>The FDA&#x02019;s 2013 gluten-free labeling rule was a culmination of many years of work in the gluten-free community and within the FDA. It is intended to help consumers following a gluten-free diet easily identify gluten-free foods. It also provides standardization of what the term &#x0201c;gluten-free&#x0201d; means on the food label (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is important to note that manufacturers are not required to label foods gluten-free; rather, this voluntary rule sets a standard for the use of the term. According to the FDA&#x02019;s rule, the term &#x0201c;gluten-free&#x0201d; can be used on the food label if a product contains &#x0003c;20 ppm of gluten (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Unlike the Food Allergy Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), which only took ingredients into account for gluten-free labeling, the 2013 gluten-free label ruling also takes into account potential contamination of gluten-free products at any point in production. Additional details about the gluten-free labeling rule are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>FDA Rule for Gluten-Free Food Labeling (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The FDA labeling rule for gluten-free foods states that a food may be labeled gluten free if the following criteria are met:<break/>1.

This is best accomplished through consultation with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) who is experienced in treating celiac disease and diabetes. The carbohydrate and fat content of gluten-free foods often is higher than in gluten-containing foods (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In addition, the fiber content is typically lower, particularly if individuals eat the majority of grain servings in the form of rice-based, refined, and processed foods. Early studies in this area found that gluten-free foods may have a higher glycemic index than comparable gluten-containing foods, but more recent research does not support this conclusion (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It is important for patients to read the labels of gluten-free foods for carbohydrate content and because serving sizes may differ from those of similar gluten-containing foods.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Improve the Nutritional Profile of the Gluten-Free Diet</title><p>Good sources of fiber in the gluten-free diet include fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and gluten-free grains, in particular buckwheat, quinoa, millet, sorghum, and teff. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> provides a list of practical ways to encourage increased consumption of fiber and whole grains on the gluten-free diet.

Levels of these vitamins and minerals should be tested at regular intervals by the provider, and supplementation should be prescribed if necessary. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can be exacerbated by secondary lactose intolerance, which is common in those with newly diagnosed celiac disease because of damaged villi and reduction in the amount of available lactase enzyme (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Those with secondary lactose intolerance should be counseled about other sources of dietary calcium, including cheese, which is often very low in lactose; fortified orange juice; fortified soy or rice milk; collard greens and spinach; and canned sardines and salmon. Good sources of iron in the gluten-free diet include beef, fortified gluten-free breakfast cereals, beans, quinoa, amaranth, and teff.</p><p>Patients with diabetes and celiac disease may choose to use nonnutritive sweeteners. Aspartame (brand names Equal and Nutrasweet), saccharin (brand names Sweet-n-Low or Sugar Twin), and stevia (brand names Sun Crystals and Truvia) are all gluten-free, according to manufacturers&#x02019; websites. Sucralose (brand name Splenda) has no gluten-containing ingredients, but according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s website, the manufacturer does not test the final product for gluten content. Sweeteners containing sugar alcohols such as xylitol, maltitol, or sorbitol are gluten-free but can cause significant gastrointestinal upset (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This can often be mistaken for a gluten reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Key Counseling Tips</title><p>Patients with diabetes who inquire about adopting a gluten-free diet should be informed about the potential nutritional risks of the diet for those who do not absolutely require it for the treatment of celiac disease or NCGS. In addition, patients should be instructed not to experiment with the gluten-free diet without proper testing to rule out celiac disease. For those with diagnosed celiac disease and concurrent type 1 diabetes, intensive management with an experienced RDN is necessary. With careful planning that takes into account carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, those with diabetes and celiac disease can achieve a balanced and enjoyable diet.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Duality of Interest</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Daily Mail</collab></person-group>
