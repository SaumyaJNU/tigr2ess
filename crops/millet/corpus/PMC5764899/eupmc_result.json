    "Myo-inositol hexaphosphate, also known as phytic acid (PA), is the most abundant storage form of phosphorus in seeds. PA acts as a strong chelator of metal cations to form phytate and is considered an anti-nutrient as it reduces the bioavailability of important micronutrients. Although the major nutrient source for more than one-half of the global population, rice is a poor source of essential micronutrients. Therefore, biofortification and reducing the PA content of rice have arisen as new strategies for increasing micronutrient bioavailability in rice. Furthermore, global climate change effects, particularly rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, are expected to increase the PA content and reduce the concentrations of most of the essential micronutrients in rice grain. Several genes involved in PA biosynthesis have been identified and characterized in rice. Proper understanding of the genes related to PA accumulation during seed development and creating the means to suppress the expression of these genes should provide a foundation for manipulating the PA content in rice grain. Low-PA rice mutants have been developed that have a significantly lower grain PA content, but these mutants also had reduced yields and poor agronomic performance, traits that challenge their effective use in breeding programs. Nevertheless, transgenic technology has been effective in developing low-PA rice without hampering plant growth or seed development. Moreover, manipulating the micronutrient distribution in rice grain, enhancing micronutrient levels and reducing the PA content in endosperm are possible strategies for increasing mineral bioavailability. Therefore, a holistic breeding approach is essential for developing successful low-PA rice lines. In this review, we focus on the key determinants for PA concentration in rice grain and discuss the possible molecular methods and approaches for manipulating the PA content to increase micronutrient bioavailability."
