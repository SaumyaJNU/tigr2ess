Targeting hotspots may accelerate reductions in transmission and could be pivotal for malaria elimination. Determinants of hotspot location, particularly of their movement, are poorly understood. We used spatial statistical methods to identify foci of incidence of self-reported malaria in a large census population of 64,000 people, in 8,290 compounds over a 2.5-year study period. Regression models examine stability of hotspots and identify static and dynamic correlates with their location. Hotspot location changed over short time-periods, rarely recurring in the same area. Hotspots identified in spring versus fall season differed in their stability. Households located in a hotspot in the fall were more likely to be located in a hotspot the following fall (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.77, 95% CI: 1.66&#x02013;1.89), but the opposite was true for compounds in spring hotspots (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15, 95% CI: 0.08&#x02013;0.28). Location within a hotspot was related to environmental and static household characteristics such as distance to roads or rivers. Human migration into a household was correlated with risk of hotspot membership, but the direction of the association differed based on the origin of the migration event.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A hotspot of malaria transmission is defined as &#x02018;a geographical area within an endemic focus of malaria transmission where transmission intensity exceeds the average level&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hotspots have been identified at many spatial scales, from groups of households to multi-country regional zones, using many different indices of malaria burden. It has been noted that although hotspots occur across the spectrum of transmission intensity, such spatial heterogeneity is more pronounced in areas of lower transmission and uneven rainfall.</p><p id="Par3">Interventions that are designed to leverage the spatial heterogeneity of transmission are at the forefront of the operations research agenda. Identifying hotspots could significantly improve targeting of control measures which could be more effective than spreading equivalent resources over larger areas or populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, hotspots have been postulated to act as reservoirs of residual transmission in areas with otherwise effective control measures and may &#x02018;fuel&#x02019; continual transmission within a larger area. If this is true, then interventions directed at hotspots could reduce transmission outside of the targeted area.</p><p id="Par4">Targeting hotspots requires identifying, or ideally predicting, hotspot locations. Identifying hotspots has become an active area of investigation and several studies have shed light on the possible factors that contribute to foci of transmission, including environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, behavioral factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and previous exposure and acquired immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

The WHDSS encompasses an area of 115&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>. Approximately 52% of the population lives below the poverty line, with limited access to piped water and electricity. The main economic activities include sugarcane farming as a cash crop, while maize, sorghum and millet are cultivated as subsistence crops. Dairy and poultry farming are also widely practiced. The WHDSS is described in more detail elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">The area has a tropical climate and lies at an elevation of 1523&#x02009;m above sea level. It experiences an average annual temperature of 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and receives high rainfall ranging from 1200 to 1800 mm annually. Malaria burden in Bungoma East and the WHDSS is high, due to the suitable climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Malaria is perennial with peaks following the rains. Typically, transmission peaks in April-June following the long rains with a smaller peak in October following the short rains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par9">All households in the WHDSS were mapped and enrolled at baseline. Baseline data collection occurred in November 2008 and continued for 4 months. Data collection was repeated biannually in the fall from September 1 to December 31 and in the spring from March 1 &#x02013; June 30th. Each data collection period is called a &#x02018;Round&#x02019;. GPS coordinates were recorded for each compound, consisting of between 1&#x02013;16 households. A household is defined as a group of people who regularly &#x0201c;eat from the same pot&#x0201d; (in other words, share cooking arrangements). A &#x0201c;resident&#x0201d; of a household is defined as an individual who has lived in that household continuously for a period of at least four calendar months prior to the interview date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Households within a compound usually consist of extended family in separate but closely grouped dwellings. Twice per year, enumerators visited every household to record all births, deaths, illnesses and migrations. Data were either collected on paper forms and entered into a database or collected on personal data assistants using Pendragon forms.</p><p id="Par10">The WHDSS has 6 sublocations (Median area&#x02009;=&#x02009;20.0 sq km) and within each sublocation are approximately 140 villages. Due to inconsistencies in data collection in one survey round, one sublocation in the southernmost part of the study area was removed from the analysis. Although teams moved from village to village within a sublocation, several teams of data collectors worked simultaneously in all parts of the WHDSS area at once during each round of data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data processing</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Malaria Morbidity</title><p id="Par11">Information about all illnesses experienced by household members since the last study visit were self-reported (in the case of minor children, reported by a guardian). Recall windows are therefore the amount of time elapsed since the previous study visit (estimated median recall window is 182 days). Dates of illness and treatment were recorded. All illness episodes that were self-reported as &#x02018;malaria&#x02019; (ICD-10-CM codes B54, &#x0201c;Unspecified Malaria&#x0201d;) were included in the analysis. To avoid double-counting the same illness, any malaria episode that occurred within 3 weeks of an initial malaria illness was censored. To capture compound-level malaria incidence by season, malaria episodes were aggregated to the compound level and further aggregated by 6-month periods (Spring: January-June; Fall: July-December, each interval centered on a &#x02018;Round&#x02019; in April and September)(Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We required that an individual be present within a compound for the entirety of the 6-month interval for their reported malaria episode to be counted for that compound. The recall period of morbidity data in the baseline round (Round 1), were not consistent with subsequent rounds, therefore, our analysis period begins with Round 2.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics of the study population (n (%) unless otherwise noted).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Observations</th><th>8300</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Number (%) with data by rounds (Total Population)</td></tr><tr><td>All rounds</td><td>7409 (89.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Missed 1</td><td>653 (7.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>Missed 2 or more</td><td>238 (2.9%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Number (%) with data by rounds (Children 0&#x02013;5 years)</td></tr><tr><td>Households with child under 5 in any round</td><td>6606 (79.6%)</td></tr><tr><td>Households with child under 5 in all rounds</td><td>4591 (55.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>Altitude (meters), median (IQR)</td><td>1505 (1475, 1559)</td></tr><tr><td>Compound population (Mean), median (IQR)</td><td>7 (5, 9.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Household head or spouse in compound farming<sup>1</sup></td><td>6212 (80.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of cattle owned<sup>1</sup>, median (IQR)</td><td>1 (0, 3)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of sheep/goats owned<sup>1</sup>, median (IQR)</td><td>0 (0, 1)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of poultry owned<sup>1</sup>, median (IQR)</td><td>4 (1, 8)</td></tr><tr><td>Land ownership (acres)<sup>1</sup>, median (IQR)</td><td>1.25 (0.64, 2.75)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Water source<sup>1,2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Piped</td><td>2889 (37.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>Spring (protected or unprotected)</td><td>2841 (36.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Well</td><td>1141 (13.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>1113 (14.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Distance to river (meters), median (IQR)</td><td>2807 (1411, 3921)</td></tr><tr><td>Distance to road (meters), median (IQR)</td><td>267 (117, 485)</td></tr><tr><td>Distance to health facility (meters), median (IQR)</td><td>2771 (1859, 3748)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>Household characteristics (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;7713). <sup>2</sup>Multiple water sources per compound are possible.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par12">Representing 20% of the total population in the WHDSS, children age 0 to 5 account for 40% of the malaria cases reported.

The scan statistic is calculated using a discrete Poisson model with an outcome of the count of malaria episodes per compound, per 6-month interval. Spatial scan test statistics are calculated by moving a circular window systematically through the study space of a geographic area and varying the radius of the window. For each location and radius, observed cases are compared to expected cases under the null hypothesis that the&#x000a0;pattern of locations of malaria cases is proportional to the population at risk, against an alternative that, in some locations, malaria cases will exceed the number that would be expected under the null model.

A maximum likelihood ratio test evaluates whether the null or alternative model better fits the data at each location. The scan statistic is the maximum observed likelihood ratio statistic over all possible window sizes with a p-value obtained through Monte Carlo simulation based on discrete Poisson randomization. P-values are adjusted to account for multiple testing across all potential clusters. In our analysis, we considered a p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 to indicate the presence of a malaria hotspot. Because foci of malaria fever incidence are generally 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;km in size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, we limited the size of our window to a 2 kilometer radius and limited the percentage of population-at-risk that could fall into a single hotspot as 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The population at risk included all individuals present in a compound. For analyses of the subpopulation of children age 0 to 5, we limited the population at risk to individuals in this age group. By extension, only compounds that had at least one child in this age group during a particular round could be included in calculation of the scan statistic.</p><p id="Par14">Malaria reporting rates can vary over time due to the seasonality of transmission. Data collection rounds lasted for several months, therefore the recall window for a household may fall within different parts of the malaria season from other households leading to differing recall lengths between households. To account for this, we performed covariate adjustment prior to computing spatial scan statistics by entering median village visit dates for a particular round into exponential models to compute predicted counts of malaria episodes at the compound level for each interval. Predicted values then replaced the population offsets to yield a visit date adjusted spatial scan statistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Scan statistics were computed using spatial-only models and were repeated for every 6-month interval over the course of each of the five included study rounds.

Those who were missing compound coordinates were less likely to report malaria illness, however, we expect this type of missing data to be spatially homogenous and thus have little impact on our analysis of malaria hotspots. Finally, household/compound characteristics were missing for 7% of the compounds, which will not affect hotspot identification or correlation with dynamic variables but could potentially bias effect estimates in our static analysis. To evaluate this, we performed chi square tests on the age 0 to 5 and total population sample to evaluate potential dependence between the outcome (hotspot membership) and probability of missing data in compound characteristics and quantified the effect by calculating inverse probability weights using available spatially derived variables such as the TFA analytic variables, TWI, and altitude.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p id="Par25">The WHDSS received study approval from the joint Institutional Review and Ethical Committee (IREC) of Moi University and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations established by IREC and MTRH.

In a population of 64,000 people, we find that hotspots move in space across six-month intervals and rarely recur in the same position. Only a small proportion of households were located in a hotspot more than once in the three-year study period. Falling within a hotspot in one six-month interval substantially reduced the risk of belonging to a hotspot in the following interval. The same is true one year later, but only if the household was in a hotspot in a spring interval (corresponding to the long rains). However, those who were in a fall hotspot (during the short rains) had a nearly 2-fold higher risk of being in a hotspot one year later during the following fall. The difference in the six-monthly versus annual patterns is modified by season and suggests a qualitative difference between spring and fall hotspots.</p><p id="Par38">Human movement, particularly migration into a household, played a significant role in risk of hotspot membership. Human movement from areas with differing levels of exposure and importation of varying parasite genotypes have been identified as risk factors in malaria transmission in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, this is the first time that human population dynamics have been implicated in local foci of elevated transmission. The magnitude and direction of the effect was specific to the origin of the migration event and was independent of total household size. Local migration within the study area was most strongly predictive of hotspot membership. Individuals migrating from nearby hotspots <italic>reduced</italic> the risk of hotspot membership in the next six-month interval, but migration from non-hotspots had the opposite effect. Based on this information, it seems less likely that migration is responsible for parasite importation and more likely that a migration event from a non-hotspot brings a susceptible individual into an area of elevated exposure, thus increasing the risk of a clinical episode. Conversely, a migrant from a recent hotspot is more likely to have some elevated immunity thus decreasing the risk of a new clinical episode. This is supported by the observation that urban migrants increase risk of hotspot membership. It is interesting that rural migrants also increase the risk of hotspot membership. Although a rural area may not be endemic (for example, coming from the highlands), rural areas are overall likely to have higher malaria transmission than urban areas. We cannot rule out the possibility of a migrant from outside the study area, whether rural or urban, importing an antigenically distinct parasite for which local immunity is lower thus increasing the risk of a local hotspot.</p><p id="Par39">Although specific static covariates were correlated with elevated risk of hotspot membership, the magnitude of the association was modest. Amongst the static variables, geographic location with respect to the road, the river, and a health facility were most strongly correlated with risk of being in a hotspot. Consistent with other studies, we also find that hotspots are associated with a mix of other static risk factors such as environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, altitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and participation in farming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">The dynamic nature of hotspots in our cohort has major implications for hotspot targeting. At least one other study has identified spatially dynamic hotspots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and one documented hotspots emerging as transmission declined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Bejon <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> found that hotspots of symptomatic, febrile malaria were more mobile in space than foci of asymptomatic infection. This is probably because the foci for asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites arise from malaria endemic areas with perennial transmission, and as a result have malaria reservoir among infected individuals in excess of 1000-parasite/&#x003bc;&#x02113; blood required to trigger gametogony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, symptomatic and febrile malaria hotspots are located in foci where malaria infection are transient and occur mainly as a result of mosquito succession following the onset and progression of seasonal rains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These rains are usually non-uniform over a geographical area and malaria vector breeding will be spatially and temporally variable as the rains progress. It remains to be determined whether hotspots defined on larger geographic scales are as dynamic.</p><p id="Par41">Our study has several limitations which must be weighed when interpreting the results. First, our outcome of symptomatic malaria is defined by self-report. Although it is distinguished from unknown febrile illness and other common morbidities in the dataset, it is likely that malaria is over-reported and therefore our definition has high sensitivity but low specificity. There is also some concern that those experiencing fever may assume malaria is the cause or may refer to any fever with the same terminology as they do malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, morbidity reports from the WHDSS include other causes of fever (e.g. otitis media, typhoid fever, other infections) as well as non-specific fever (ICD 10CM R50.9), reported both by individuals who seek treatment in health facilities and those who self-medicate, indicating that both facilities and individuals are distinguishing between malaria and other causes of fever (37% of non-specific fever is reported by individuals who sought treatment as health facilities). Furthermore, self-reported malaria cases show the seasonality expected of malaria (see Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Other common causes of pediatric fever, such as influenza, have shown different seasonality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Even in the presence of significant over-reporting of malaria, our identification of hotspots will not be biased unless the over-reporting varies spatially.</p><p id="Par42">Recall bias may also have affected the accuracy of the data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, although it is unlikely to be more problematic within hotspots than outside and therefore unlikely to have influenced the detection of hotspots. Second, the period of data collection, 2.5 years, while longer than many previous studies, is a relatively short analytical time frame and limits our ability to describe the long-term mobility or annual patterns of hotspot location. Finally, there are undoubtedly many relevant static and dynamic factors that we were not able to incorporate into our model, such as bednet use and proximity to mosquito habitats.</p><p id="Par43">This is the first study of which we are aware that uses a large, longitudinal census population to explore hotspot location at the level of residential location of households. Our study population is more than ten-times larger than previous longitudinal hotspot analyses. This allowed us to look at malaria incidence for all ages in a contiguous geographic area rather than a sub-sample&#x000a0;of geographic locations or a specific age group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, morbidity was recorded from all residents rather than from a sample reporting to a health facility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The census structure also allows individuals to enter or leave the sample over time, incorporating true population dynamics into the malaria hotspot risk model. The longitudinal structure of the data allowed us to not only to track individuals and households over time and space, but also allowed us to compare hotspot location between seasons and years. Our findings are highly relevant to studies exploring hotspot interventions and highlight the challenge of predicting hotspot locations. More research is needed to understand the factors that determine hotspot location, with special emphasis on those that can be measured dynamically on appropriate spatial and temporal scales.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par44">Original datasets contain identifiable information on subjects and must be requested separately from the WHDSS through Moi University.
