Several hypotheses relating migratory behavior to the likelihood of parasitism have entered the literature, making conflicting, testable predictions. To assess how migratory behavior of hosts is associated with parasitism, we compared haemosporidian parasite infections between two closely related populations of a common North American sparrow, the dark-eyed junco, that co-occur in shared habitats during the non-breeding season. One population is sedentary and winters and breeds in the Appalachian Mountains. The other population is migratory and is found in seasonal sympatry with the sedentary population from October through April, but then flies (&#x02265; 900 km) northwards to breed. The populations were sampled in the wild on the shared montane habitat at the beginning of winter and again after confining them in a captive common environment until the spring. We found significantly higher prevalence of haemosporidian parasite infections in the sedentary population. Among infected juncos, we found no difference in parasite densities (parasitemias) between the sedentary and migrant populations and no evidence for winter dormancy of the parasites. Our results suggest that long-distance migration may reduce the prevalence of parasite infections at the population level. Our results are inconsistent with the migratory exposure hypothesis, which posits that long-distance migration increases exposure of hosts to diverse parasites, and with the migratory susceptibility hypothesis, which posits that trade-offs between immune function and migration increase host susceptibility to parasites. However, our results are consistent with the migratory culling hypothesis, which posits that heavily infected animals are less likely to survive long-distance migration, and with the migratory escape hypothesis, which posits that long-distance migration allows host populations to seasonally escape areas of high infection risk.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2 T32 HD049336-11A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2827-9387</contrib-id><name><surname>Slowinski</surname><given-names>Samuel P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1257474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ketterson</surname><given-names>Ellen D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006733</institution-id><institution>Indiana University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRSP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ketterson</surname><given-names>Ellen D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spellman</surname><given-names>Garth M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Institute of Health Common Themes in Reproductive Diversity program for a Predoctoral Fellowship to SPS (grant number 2 T32 HD049336-11A1), the National Science Foundation (IOS-1257474 to E.D.K.), a FRSP grant from Indiana University to E.D.K., and by an Institutional Development Award (IDeA) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under grant number P20GM103443 through the South Dakota Biomedical Research Infrastructure Network (SD BRIN) core facilities.

Animals likely evolved long-distance migration to track seasonal resources (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]), avoid harsh environmental conditions, and/or reduce predation risk [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Regardless of their evolutionary origins, long-distance migrations influence the physiology, behavior, and fitness of migratory animals throughout their annual cycles, and fundamentally alter their interactions with pathogens and parasites. As migratory animals move seasonally across the landscape, entirely new spatial and temporal dynamics emerge with respect to host-parasite interactions. This adds complexity to our theoretical frameworks and empirical characterizations of critically important topics in both disease ecology and host-parasite coevolution. In the present study, we leveraged intra-specific variation in migratory strategies to examine how the migratory behavior of animal hosts relates to the prevalence, intensity, and diversity of their parasites, and to the timing of parasite life cycles.</p><p>Several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been put forth to predict the association between long-distance host migratory behavior and the dynamics of parasite infections, including their prevalence, diversity, and virulence (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). According to the migratory culling hypothesis, heavily infected animals are less likely to survive the physiological stresses of long-distance migration [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, infected animals are predicted to be culled from host populations via natural selection. The migratory escape hypothesis posits that long-distance migration allows host populations to seasonally escape areas that have become heavily infested with parasites [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence the migratory culling hypothesis and the migratory escape hypothesis both predict that parasite prevalence should be higher in sedentary host populations than in closely related migratory host populations. This prediction has received some empirical support from studies on both migratory vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the migratory exposure hypothesis postulates that migrating through multiple different habitats increases parasite exposure in migratory animals. Migratory animals may be exposed to different parasites at their breeding grounds, stopover sites, and wintering grounds, and consequently accumulate a higher prevalence and diversity of parasites than sedentary animals [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the migratory susceptibility hypothesis suggests that trade-offs between migration and immunity could increase the susceptibility of migrants to acquiring new infections during the course of migration, leading to an even higher prevalence of parasites in migrants relative to sedentary animals (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]).

While such among-species comparisons suggest that host migration may increase exposure to parasites and infection risk, fewer studies have made comparisons within vertebrate species, where the interpretive challenges of phylogenetic history and host-specificity should be minimized. In the only published study that we are aware of comparing parasite prevalence with migratory propensity <italic>within</italic> a vertebrate host species, Kelly, MacGillivray [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found a higher prevalence of haematozoan parasite infections in adult long-distance migrant song sparrows <italic>Melospiza melodia</italic> relative to conspecifics that migrated shorter distances. More research is needed to assess how migratory behavior is associated with parasitism among closely related populations <italic>within</italic> vertebrate species. In the present study, we compared haemosporidian parasite infections in a sedentary songbird population versus a closely related conspecific migrant population. Haemosporidians are protozoan parasites that infect vertebrate red blood cells and are transmitted by dipteran insect vectors. Haemosporidians include the malaria-causing genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Avian haemosporidian parasites can be pathogenic in wild populations (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Haemosporidian parasites have been studied extensively in avian populations, and serve as a model for the study of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). We assess how host migratory strategies are associated with the prevalence and intensity (objective 1), and the timing of seasonal dormancy (objective 2) of haemosporidian parasites.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective 1: Association between host migration and infection prevalence and parasitemia</title><p>Our first objective was to explore how variation in host migratory behavior is associated with the prevalence and parasitemia of a widespread and diverse class of parasites, the haemosporidia, that infect a common songbird host, the dark-eyed junco (<italic>Junco hyemalis</italic>). Specifically, we compared haemosporidian parasite infections in the bloodstream, during seasonal sympatry, between a sedentary junco population and a closely related migrant junco population that share wintering grounds in Virginia, USA. Based on the migratory culling hypothesis and the migratory escape hypothesis, we predicted that the prevalence and/or parasitemia of haemosporidian parasite infections would be higher in the sedentary junco population than in the migrant population (<xref rid="pone.0201563.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Alternatively, based on the migratory exposure hypothesis and the migratory susceptibility hypothesis, we predicted that the prevalence and/or parasitemia of haemosporidian parasites would be higher in the migrant population than the sedentary population (<xref rid="pone.0201563.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Objective 2: Measuring seasonality in the parasite lifecycle</title><p>In temperate climates, some avian haemosporidian parasites alternate between an active stage in the spring and summer, during which the parasites grow and replicate and produce transmissible life stages in the bloodstream of their host, and a dormant stage in the winter during which the parasites sequester in the host organs (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Thus, our second objective was to examine whether haemosporidian parasites in our study system exhibit this seasonal pattern. We predicted that prevalence and parasitemia of parasites detectable in the host blood stream would be lower during the winter (when parasites were dormant in the host organs) and would increase in the spring (when parasites re-emerged and started replicating in the host blood stream). We tested these predictions by measuring haemosporidian prevalence and parasitemia in blood samples collected from juncos from both populations during the winter (December) and spring (early March and late March).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Study system</title><p>We compared haemosporidian parasite infections between two populations of dark-eyed junco hosts that share wintering habitat at the Mountain Lake Biological Station in Pembroke, VA (37.37&#x000b0;N, 80.52&#x000b0;W).

Briefly, sedentary (<italic>Junco hyemalis carolinensis</italic>, <italic>n = 19</italic>) and migrant (<italic>Junco hyemalis hyemalis</italic>, <italic>n = 18</italic>) male juncos were captured from 4&#x02013;12 December 2013, at the Mountain Lake Biological Station in Giles County, Virginia (37.37&#x000b0;N, 80.52&#x000b0;W). Juncos were captured in mist-nets and potter traps baited with cracked corn and millet. Population status (sedentary or migrant) was determined based on bill coloration, plumage, and wing chord [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Age class was determined for each bird based on wing plumage color [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the distribution of ages of the juncos in this study were selected to be balanced across populations. At the time of capture, a blood sample was collected by pricking the brachial vein with a sterile needle. For blood DNA samples collected in the field in December, about 150 &#x003bc;l of blood was collected into a microcapillary tube and was stored in a buffer preservative (Longmire&#x02019;s solution) at 4&#x000b0;C until the DNA was extracted.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Housing and sampling of birds during the captivity experiment</title><p>After capture, birds were housed briefly (1&#x02013;10 days) in identical outdoor aviaries at the Mountain Lake Biological Station. On December 14, birds were transported to Bloomington, Indiana, where they were brought into an indoor aviary environment until they were resampled in early and late March. The purpose of resampling the juncos in captivity in the spring was to test the hypothesis that haemosporidian parasites go dormant in the host organs during the winter and re-emerge and start replicating in the host bloodstream during the spring. Because haemosporidian parasites are obligately vector-transmitted, and because there were no vectors in our indoor aviary environment, we assume that there was no transmission of haemosporidian parasites among juncos while they were in captivity.</p><p>In the indoor aviary environment, birds were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and maintained on a photoperiod that was advanced every three days to match the natural photoperiod at their capture site (Mountain Lake Biological Station, VA, 37.37&#x000b0;N, 80.52&#x000b0;W). They were housed in all-male, mixed-population flocks with equal numbers of migrants and sedentary birds until February 27, when they were individually housed in cages in seven replicate rooms. Each room housed 3 migrants and 3 sedentary birds. The temperature was maintained at 16&#x000b0; &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0; C [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

To verify infection status of each sample, PCR was independently run twice per sample, followed by gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. A negative control (water and PCR reagents with no DNA template) was also run to confirm that there was no contamination of haemosporidian DNA in the PCR reagents. Gels were scored treatment blind by RDM and SPS to determine haemosporidian infection status and infection prevalence within each population. A sample was considered positive (infected) if there was a visible band (at 478bp) on at least one of the gel runs. Nested PCR products from positive samples were sequenced using Sanger sequencing at the Western South Dakota DNA Core Facility at Black Hills State University (BigDye v3.1 Cycle Sequencing; ABI3130 series Genetic Analyzer). Using Sequencher v5.4.6 software, the forward and reverse sequences were manually trimmed at 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; ends for poor quality base calls and assembled automatically to form a contiguous sequence for each sample&#x02019;s PCR product.

Among infected juncos, we found no difference between the parasitemias circulating in the bloodstream of sedentary versus migrant juncos. These results are consistent with the migratory culling hypothesis and with the migratory escape hypothesis and suggest that long-distance migration may reduce the prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in birds. The higher prevalence of parasites that we observed in sedentary hosts is also consistent with previous empirical research showing that migration is associated with reduced parasitism in monarch butterflies [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201563.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and galaxiid fishes [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, previous research in another avian blood-parasite system demonstrated a very different relationship between host migration and parasitism.

Future research should investigate why the association between long-distance migration and parasitism differs across study systems and ecological contexts.</p><p>Migratory culling and migratory escape are non-mutually exclusive mechanisms that each could explain the reduced prevalence of haemosporidian parasites that we observed in migrant juncos. Within our data set, it is not possible to eliminate either of these potential mechanisms. Future research should assess the possible contributions of each mechanism to the population difference that we observed by testing additional predictions made by the migratory culling and migratory escape hypotheses. For example, the migratory culling hypothesis predicts that parasites reduce flight performance and/or increase the costs of long-distance flight. This prediction has received support in butterflies infected with a protozoan parasite [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but did not receive support in a study of great reed warblers infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A comparison of the seasonal density profiles of (infected) vectors at the breeding site for sedentary juncos (Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia) versus at breeding sites for migrant juncos (in Alaska, Canada, and/or Northern New England) could provide a more direct test for the migratory escape hypothesis, as the migratory escape hypothesis predicts that migrant birds should experience reduced haemosporidian parasite exposure at their breeding grounds relative to sedentary birds.</p><p>We reject migratory exposure and migratory susceptibility as primary drivers of variation in infection prevalence between our study populations. The migratory exposure hypothesis and the migratory susceptibility hypothesis predict that sedentary host populations should exhibit <italic>lower</italic> parasite infection prevalence relative to closely related migrant populations. Therefore, our observation that a sedentary host population exhibited a <italic>higher</italic> prevalence of haemosporidian parasite infections directly contradicts a key prediction of these hypotheses.</p><p>Our analysis of infection prevalence based on qPCR produced qualitatively similar results in December and early March to our analysis based on nested PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201563.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In both analyses sedentary birds exhibited higher infection prevalence than migratory birds in December and early March. However, our analyses of infection prevalence produced qualitatively different results in late March. Our qPCR results suggest that the sedentary population maintained a significantly higher haemosporidian infection prevalence than the migratory population in late March. However, our nested PCR results suggest that the infection prevalence in the migratory population increased between early March and late March, resulting in no significant population difference in infection prevalence in late March. We do not know why our metrics of infection prevalence produced different results in late March. Perhaps differences in the sensitivity and/or specificity of the qPCR and nested PCR primers could explain this discrepancy in our results. The nested PCR primers we used are sensitive for detecting both <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections in avian blood [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The qPCR primers that we used are sensitive for detecting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> but not <italic>Leucocytozoon</italic> infections, and the sensitivity of our qPCR primers to <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> is unknown [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Overall, taking data from all three time points together, both methods (qPCR and nested PCR) provided support for the prediction that sedentary juncos exhibit higher haemosporidian infection prevalence relative to migratory juncos at our study site.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Community composition of the haemosporidian parasites</title><p>While five distinct haemosporidian lineages were detected in the sedentary population and four distinct haemosporidian lineages were detected in the migrant population, one haemosporidian lineage (SEIAUR01; <italic>Plasmodium cathemerium</italic>) was dominant in both our sedentary and migrant populations. This dominance of the same parasite lineage in both populations suggests that haemosporidian transmission may occur between the sedentary and migrant populations. Alternatively, it is possible that <italic>Plasmodium cathemerium</italic> was dominant in both populations because it is a common and widespread lineage that was encountered and acquired independently by the sedentary and migrant populations at their respective breeding grounds. Sharing of haemosporidian parasite lineages between seasonally sympatric sedentary and migratory host populations has been previously observed in other avian systems. Clark, Clegg [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that some haemosporidian parasite lineages were shared between wintering migrant and resident wading birds in Australia at their shared wintering grounds, suggesting active transmission between migrants and residents. Ricklefs, Medeiros [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that parasite lineage sharing was more likely to occur between sedentary and migrant birds sharing habitat when the sedentary and migrant birds were more taxonomically similar.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Objective 2: Examining seasonality in the parasite lifecycle</title><p>Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence for winter dormancy of the haemosporidian parasites. A substantial prevalence of haemosporidian parasite infections was detectable (via qPCR and nested PCR methodology) in the blood stream in midwinter (December) in both host populations, suggesting that haemosporidian parasites do not markedly sequester and go dormant in the host organs in our study system. We found mixed evidence for a spring re-emergence of haemosporidian parasites from the host organs into the host bloodstream in the early or late March sampling points, as neither the prevalence nor parasitemia of haemosporidian infections increased over the course of the study in either population in our qPCR analysis, however, in our nested PCR analysis infection prevalence increased over the course of the study in the migrant but not in the sedentary population.</p><p>We propose three possible explanations for why we did not observe a detectable increase in the prevalence or parasitemia of haemosporidian parasites in the bloodstream from December to late March in our qPCR analysis, and for why we only detected an increased infection prevalence in the migrant but not in the sedentary population in our nested PCR analysis. First, it is possible that the pattern of dormancy in the organs during the winter, followed by replication in the bloodstream during the spring and summer, may not occur in our study populations. The evidence for winter dormancy of haemosporidian parasites in temperate avian populations is mixed. Some previous studies have found a pattern of high levels of haemosporidians circulating in the avian blood stream during the spring and summer, with low or undetectable parasite levels during the winter [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], suggesting a pattern of winter dormancy. On the other hand, another study found a high haemosporidian prevalence detectable in the bloodstream of rusty blackbirds (<italic>Euphagus carolinus</italic>) during the winter in Mississippi and Arkansas, suggesting that winter dormancy of haemosporidian parasites may not occur in those populations [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consistent with the Barnard, Mettke-Hofmann [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] study, our results suggest that winter dormancy in the host organs may not occur in some temperate avian haemosporidian populations.</p><p>Alternatively, while the high prevalence of infections that we measured in December clearly demonstrates that haemosporidians are still circulating in the blood stream during the winter, and are not completely sequestered in the host organs, it is still possible that haemosporidians in our study system exhibit partial dormancy and sequestration in the organs. Therefore, we propose that a second possible explanation for why we did not observe a stronger pattern of seasonal increase in parasite prevalence or parasitemia over the course of our study is that not all of the seasonal environmental cues required to induce spring re-emergence of haemosporidians into the host bloodstream were present in the indoor aviary environment where the juncos were housed in our study. The juncos in our study experienced a lengthening photoperiod, set to match the natural photoperiod at their capture site in Virginia. This lengthening photoperiod of the common aviary environment was previously shown to be a sufficient cue of seasonal change to induce reproductive (physiological and behavioral) development in the sedentary population [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a longer photoperiod than the birds experienced in late March (the end of our study) may be required to induce the re-emergence of haemosporidians into the blood stream. Alternatively, lengthening photoperiod may not be a sufficient environmental cue, on its own, to induce parasites to re-emerge from dormancy in the host organs and to start replicating in the bloodstream. In addition to photoperiodic cues, the activity and replication of avian haemosporidian parasites may respond plastically to supplemental cues such as changes in temperature, food availability, or exposure to vectors [<xref rid="pone.0201563.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Finally, the effect of maintaining birds in an indoor aviary environment on haemosporidian parasite infections is unknown. It is possible that the stress of being maintained in an indoor aviary environment could lead to year-round chronic infection. To our knowledge, no previous studies have measured seasonal activity of avian haemosporidian parasites in a controlled indoor aviary environment. Future research should manipulate photoperiod in combination with manipulations in supplemental cues in a controlled indoor aviary environment to assess whether lengthening photoperiod, supplemental cues, or a combination of lengthening photoperiod and supplemental cues can induce the re-emergence and replication of dormant haemosporidian parasites.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, we provide evidence that sedentary juncos maintain a higher prevalence (but not parasitemia) of haemosporidian parasite infections throughout the winter and early spring relative to migrant juncos in a seasonally sympatric population. Our results suggest that long-distance migration may reduce the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites, although since we only compared 2 populations (one migratory and one sedentary) we cannot rule out the possibility that ecological differences between the populations other than migration (e.g. stochastic variation in abundance of parasites and/or vectors at the allopatric breeding grounds) could explain the observed population differences in parasite prevalence. Migratory culling and migratory escape are non-mutually exclusive alternative mechanisms that could potentially explain the observed lower infection prevalence in migrants. We are unable to eliminate either of these as potential mechanisms. We reject migratory exposure and migratory susceptibility as primary mechanisms explaining differences in haemosporidian infection prevalence between our study populations. Also, we found no evidence that haemosporidian parasites in our study system exhibit dormancy and sequestration in the host organs during the winter. Future research should compare haemosporidian infections across more sedentary and migrant populations within a vertebrate host species, to assess whether migrant populations consistently exhibit a lower infection prevalence, as we observed. Additionally, future research should compare the diversity of parasites infecting sedentary versus migrant conspecific host populations to test the Migratory Exposure hypothesis&#x02019; prediction that migrant host populations accumulate more diverse parasite communities. Additionally, future research should measure the density of (infected) vectors across the breeding and non-breeding ranges of sedentary and migrant populations to assess how long-distance migration affects exposure to haemosporidian parasites. Finally, future research should assess whether female juncos, and juvenile juncos, exhibit the same relationship between long-distance migration and parasitism that we observed in adult males. Overall, our research suggests that long-distance migration may reduce parasitism in migrating hosts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201563.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201563.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201563.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201563.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank J.
