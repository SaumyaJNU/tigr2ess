Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian Andes, the planted forage grass <italic>Setaria sphacelata</italic> and the weed Bracken (<italic>Pteridium arachnoideum</italic>). With increasing elevation, the competitive power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m. The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria, the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation. Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its cellular UV screen.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RU 816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>Erwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RU 816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bendix</surname><given-names>J&#x000f6;rg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the German Research Foundation in the scope of the Research Unit (RU) 816 (Biodiversity and Sustainable Management of a Megadiverse Mountain Ecosystem in South Ecuador) to JB and EB.

Since native forage grasses are absent in the understory of the dense mountain forest, introduced grass species, mostly from tropical Africa, are commonly used for pasture farming. At mid-elevations, <italic>Setaria sphacelata</italic> (referred to as &#x0201c;Setaria&#x0201d;), a C4-photosynthesis plant, is the dominating pasture grass which is transplanted manually as its seeds do not germinate under the local environmental conditions. It forms tussocks which propagate readily with tillers, and after 1 to 2 years, generates a more or less homogeneous pasture. Southern Bracken fern (<italic>Pteridium arachnoideum</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>caudatum</italic>), although indigenous to tropical South America [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], rarely occurs in the undisturbed forest, but rapidly invades areas on which fire has been used to clear the natural vegetation. It propagates by spores which are distributed by the wind. Additionally, it spreads via rhizomes which can reach down into the soil to a depth of 80 cm, but usually accumulate in the upper 20 cm of the soil forming a dense network from which single fronds develop. Bracken infests the planted pastures, running its rhizomes between the bulky rootstock of Setaria. In this communication, we worked with the diploid species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>arachnoideum</italic> (referred to as &#x0201c;Bracken&#x0201d;) which dominates in the uplands [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], whereas its allotetraploid relative <italic>P</italic>. <italic>caudatum</italic> is known as a lowland species [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although Setaria and Bracken can coexist in a labile steady state on the pastures for some years, the common procedure of pasture rejuvenation by burning favors Bracken more than Setaria on the long run [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Bracken is unevenly distributed on the slopes, and its abundance increases dramatically with elevation, while that of Setaria decreases [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The relative competitive strength of two plant species is a multi-factorial syndrome of ecophysiological traits giving rise to similar or differing responses to the environmental settings. In an unsteady coexistence of species, i.e. a delicate balance between their biomass production, even small changes in environmental factors can cause a shift in favor of one of the competitors. Factors that are known to change with altitude in the Ecuadorian Andes are the intensity of irradiation, especially UV, amounts of precipitation, and temperature [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Regarding the higher temperature optima of C4-plants (Setaria) relative to C3-plants (Bracken) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], temperature, in particular, may be an ecologically important factor that can shift the competitive equilibrium between the species. Another ecophysiological trait that could affect the balance between both species in these pasture communities is the capability to accumulate protective, especially UV-absorbing compounds which shield the photosynthetic apparatus from excessive radiation [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition to their direct role in UV-protection, flavonoids are effective antioxidants and ROS scavengers, thus protecting the plant tissue also from secondary effects of UV radiation [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Taken together, flavonoids are essential for survival and success during colonization of new territory [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In various studies, quantitative responses of phenolic and flavonoid contents have been correlated with the elevation and the intensity of UV-irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0202255.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0202255.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Invasion of Bracken into pastures as dependent upon elevation.</title><p>A digital elevation model derived by airborne laser scanning is overlaid by the land-cover classification based on multispectral satellite data generated by Quickbird in November 2010 of the research area in the San Francisco valley in South Ecuador (from 1000 m to 2800 m elevation).

Alonso-Amelot et al. [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed a positive correlation between the content of these substances in the fronds and the elevation of its occurrence. No similar adaptations are known for Setaria. Being aware that other environmental factors such as soil quality, the amount of precipitation or allelopathic effects [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] may also affect the steady state between Bracken and Setaria, we hypothesized that the decrease of temperature and the increase of UV radiation promotes the competitive growth of Bracken at higher elevations. To examine this hypothesis, we followed a four-step approach. First, we measured photosynthetic gas exchange in the field at different elevations. In a second step, we used the Southern Bracken Competition model (the SoBraCo model) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], parameterized with the field data to determine annual photosynthetic carbon net uptake of both plants along an altitudinal gradient. Subsequently, the results of the model were compared with measurements under controlled close-to-nature-conditions in greenhouses. Finally, we investigated the UV screen in plant material collected in situ and compared it to that of plants grown under greenhouse conditions with supplemental UV irradiation. Here, the potential incidence of photoinhibition and the accumulation of phenolics (flavonoids and condensed tannins) protecting the plants from UV irradiation were of particular interest. Our study explains why using Setaria and presumably other C4-photosynthesis-type grasses as forage plants in tropical pastures above 1800 m a.s.l. elevation will not allow sustainable pasture farming without further measures of Bracken control [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The plants: Setaria and Bracken</title><p>Setaria, also known as golden millet (<italic>Setaria sphacelata</italic> (Schumach.)

The core area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is the 18 km long, deeply incised valley of the Rio San Francisco (3&#x000b0; 58&#x02019; S, 79&#x000b0; 4&#x02019; W) rising at the pass El Tiro (2825 m a.s.l.) in the West and merging with the Rio Zamora at the village Sabanilla (1685 m a.s.l.) in the East. The Research Station (Estaci&#x000f3;n Cientifica San Francisco, ECSF) is located at 1835 m a.s.l. in the mountain rain forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The research area comprises the natural tropical mountain rainforest on the southern slopes which is protected as part of the Podocarpus National Park, and a system of pastures, abandoned pastures, patches with exotic afforestation (Pinus, Eucalyptus), and remnants of the natural forest in a few gorges on the slopes. The pasture side of the valley is in the focus of this study. The research area had been rented from a local farmer by the Ecuadorian foundation Naturaleza y Cultura International (Loja, Ecuador, and San Diego, USA). The research was permitted by the Ministerio del Ambiente de Provincia Zamora-Chinchipe (Permit No. 007-IC-FAU/FLO-DPZCH-MA and 019-IC-FAU/FLO-DPZCH-MA).</p><p>The pastures suffer from a non-sustainable management, and most of them are abandoned after a few years [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The soils are cambisols which are commonly poor in phosphorus and nitrogen. On the pasture sites, the originally thick litter and the organic layer [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have been removed upon clearing the forest by fire, and the nutrient input from the ash does not last long. The pH is slightly acidic (4.5 in water), and base saturation is low (between 11 and 17%) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The climate of the area is tropical wet with a cloud frequency of 70% of the year with seven months of relative air humidity above 85% [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0202255.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists climate variables for three automatic weather stations (AWS) in the area. The ECSF and the pasture AWS are on opposite slopes of the Rio San Francisco valley at different altitudes (1835 and 2110 m a.s.l., respectively), while the El Tiro station characterizes the climate of the pass altitude of the eastern Cordillera crest (2825 m a.s.l.). Temperature shows a clear decrease with altitude which is not the case for other variables in <xref rid="pone.0202255.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. This is because AWS point observations can differ from a simple elevation gradient due to its topographic position and land cover type. The lower average humidity on the pasture, for instance, is the result of a more extreme thermal and evaporation climate compared to that recorded by an AWS in the tropical mountain rain forest (ECSF) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, it could be shown with spatial explicit data sets from satellites, weather radar and modelling that particularly the exposition towards the main airstream (windward, lee side) locally modifies cloudiness and thus irradiance [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and wind stress [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The parameter V<sub>Cmax</sub> represents the RubisCO activity and is derived from the initial slope of CO<sub>2</sub>-response curves of C3-plants. For C4-plants, the maximum carboxylation rate (V<sub>max</sub>) is derived from the saturated section of the A/C<sub>i</sub> curves. Mitochondrial respiration (hereafter referred to as respiration) and the quantum yield are derived from light-response curves of CO<sub>2</sub> net assimilation. Respiration is described as the point of interception with the Y-axis of a linear regression of light intensities below 200 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

Furthermore, only in field-grown samples, a cyanidin glucoside was found that appears to be part of a larger molecule that also contains cinnamic acid. In summary, almost no effect of the UV treatment could be detected in the flavonoid patterns of the Setaria leaves.</p><p>In contrast, chromatograms of the extracts from all Bracken plants showed a large number of differently colored bands after staining with Naturstoff reagent A.

The field-grown samples contained higher amounts of soluble flavonoids than those from the greenhouse. Several blue fluorescing bands suggest the presence of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavonoid patterns of the Bracken samples from the field and from the greenhouse differred to some extent. Especially quercetin and its glycoside rutin, which produce prominent orange bands in the field samples, appear to be of low abundance or even absent in the samples from the greenhouse. Mass spectrometric analysis, however, revealed the occurrence of quercetin and rutin exclusively in UV-exposed Bracken in the greenhouse, and in the field-grown samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s007">S3 Table</xref>). The flavanone glycosides hesperidin and poncirin appear to occur only in the field-grown samples.

Ecologically, the competition between Bracken and the pasture grass Setaria is of special interest, as it reflects the equipoise of two plant species of different modes of photosynthesis. Both species are light-demanding, and their photosynthetic carbon net uptake is saturated at or even beyond 1000 &#x003bc;mol quanta m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> of PAR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, establishment of dense vegetation cover by one of the two species additionally weakens growth of the competitor by shadowing. An example of such effect is the ousting of Bracken by planting Balsa trees (<italic>Ochroma pyramidale</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] whose seedlings obviously are resistant to the allelopathic effect of Bracken frond leachate [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whether such allelopathic effect is the reason why the amply produced Setaria seeds do not germinate in the pastures of our research area, as has been shown for herbs and C3-photosynthesis type grasses [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], needs further investigation. However, growth of transplanted sections of Setaria tussocks is obviously not inhibited in soils where Bracken had previously been growing.</p><p>None of the two species are components of the original vegetation, the tropical mountain forest [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Setaria has been introduced from tropical Africa as a pasture grass, and Bracken invades the sites as a weed following land reclamation [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Both, Bracken and Setaria are therefore not <italic>per se</italic> adapted to the environmental conditions of the area. The grass is planted with a large population size whereas the fern enters the area via a massive import of spores together with a potential invasion of rhizomes from adjacent infected sites. Both plants react initially positively to the common management of burning the pastures for rejuvenation, but recurrent burning stimulates the regrowth of Bracken more than that of the grass [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In spite of a frequent cloud cover in the eastern ranges of the Andes, increasing elevation is associated with a decrease in temperature [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an increase in UV radiation [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Lower temperatures at higher elevations limit photosynthesis and growth of Setaria</title><p>Responses of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> net uptake to light intensity and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration show a clear decrease of photosynthesis with increasing elevation for Setaria, but only a low impact on Bracken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This observation is corroborated by photosynthetic measurements of both plant species grown and measured at 10, 20, and 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), as well as by the modeled temperature optimum using the SoBraCo model for carbon acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

Forcing the model with highly time-resolved microclimate data representing monthly averages over 16 years indicates a slightly superior growth of Setaria to that of Bracken on the lower pasture, but results in the opposite effect higher up in the mountains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, the model showed also some expected seasonal trends during the year, namely that in the less humid months, C4-photosynthesis of Setaria was more efficient at 1835 m a.s.l.. Even at mid elevation (2110 m a.s.l.), there was still some advantage for Setaria, but only in the driest month November. Considering the entire year, the model indicates higher biomass production for Setaria than for Bracken at the lowest experimental area at 1835 m a.s.l., comparable growth for Setaria and Bracken at mid-elevation (2110 m a.s.l.), and a clear advantage of Bracken at 2825 m a.s.l.

During times of high cloud cover, as particularly occurring in our study area [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], spikes of UV-B of up to 10 W/m<sup>2</sup> had been reached around 9:00 a.m. local time. This &#x0201c;overradiation&#x0201d; has been proven to also occur for global radiation in our study area, most likely through multiple reflections from clouds [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Exposure of Setaria plants to UV radiation resulted in reduced photosynthetic quantum yield concomitant with a decrease of the photosynthetic key protein D2 and the compelling inactivation of PSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g005">Fig 5</xref>) as was already shown in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In contrast, Bracken did not show any significant change in the photosynthetic capacity under increased UV exposure. The values for maximum quantum yield did not significantly change in comparison with control samples, suggesting that Bracken is able to adapt and perform well even at higher elevations.</p><p>The combined results from field measurements and corresponding laboratory studies suggest that the prevailing average temperature and the UV radiation on the pastures limit the growth of Setaria more severely than that of Bracken. In general, C4-plants exhibit a higher temperature optimum of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Therefore, from the type of photosynthetic carbon capture, Setaria is less suited to successfully compete with Bracken at elevations with average temperatures below 20&#x000b0;C. At 1835 m a.s.l., the average annual temperature of 16&#x000b0;C is by 4&#x000b0;C lower than the reported optimal temperature for growth of Setaria [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] which is particularly adapted to sunny, hot and low-humidity regions. The combination of relatively low temperatures (14&#x000b0;C day/10&#x000b0;C night) and high irradiation in the tropical mountains favors photoinhibition of the C4-plant more than of a C3-plant [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] that is better adapted to moderate temperatures.</p><p>Both, Setaria and Bracken are equipped with a specific pattern of phenolic compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s007">S3</xref> Tables). In Bracken, their composition varies considerably with growth conditions and elevation of the locality, while in Setaria, the pattern of phenolic secondary compounds remains largely unchanged. The insensitivity of Bracken against UV irradiation resulting from its effective chemical UV screen can be considered as one of the reasons for its success in the tropical mountain pastures. Alonso-Amelot et al. [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] showed an increase in the content of condensed tannins with increasing elevation, but they did not demonstrate an ecophysiological effect of this phenomenon. While confirming their observation, we conclude that the insensitivity of Bracken against UV irradiation results at least partly from its effective chemical UV screen (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Stress, in particular UV, is known to induce the formation of the phenylpropane protective system [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], especially in leaves [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and our results suggest that Bracken is more effective in this respect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s007">S3 Table</xref>). In contrast, Setaria did not show a comparable response to UV exposure what could be due to an already effective UV screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2 Table</xref>). However, the decrease of the photosynthetic capacity, together with the lower content of the D2 protein, proves that Setaria is not capable of producing a sufficiently effective UV screen and thus suffers from UV irradiation as well as potential ROS emergence when growing at higher elevations and suboptimal temperature (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g008">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s007">S3</xref> Tables).</p><p>The protective efficacy and potential interactions of the bouquet of flavonoids and tannins in Bracken and Setaria are difficult to disentangle, but some general effects of major individual components may be highlighted in the following. Flavonoids as well as catechins as monomers of the condensed tannins are located as soluble compounds in the vacuoles, but upon polymerization become immobilized in the cell walls (blue color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). They absorb UV-A, UV-B and blue light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) and thus can effectively screen the mesophyll from energy-rich radiation. The screening effectiveness depends on the respective absorption coefficients and concentrations. Even in the untreated leaves, the absorbance of UV and shortwave blue light by soluble compounds is substantially higher in Bracken than in Setaria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Flavonoids are also known as antioxidants or ROS scavengers in general and especially so, if they possess an ortho-dihydroxy substitution at the B-ring (hydroxyl groups at C3&#x02019; and C4&#x02019;) like the flavonol quercetin, the flavon luteolin, the flavanols catechin and epicatechin and the O-glycosides of these compounds. Quercetin is the most effective antioxidant under the identified flavonoids as it provides two more reactive structural elements which can react with all kinds of radicals [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Together with its glycoside rutin it was found exclusively in Bracken grown under additional UV in the greenhouse and in the field, but not at all in Setaria. Fairly good but less effective antioxidants than the quercetin family compounds are the flavones luteolin and its derivative orientin which were found in Setaria independently from environmental impact, and the same holds for the flavonol kaempferol and its glycosides. The flavonoid bouquet of Bracken, too, showed antioxidants whose occurrence did not respond to the environmental conditions, namely various glycosides of kaempferol and the luteolin derivative orientin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s007">S3</xref> Tables). Apparently dependent on growth in the field is the occurrence of the anthocyanidin derivative. Cyanidin derivatives are known as very effective UV screens and antioxidants, however, their formation is also known as a symptom of phosphorus deficiency, especially in grasses. This interpretation is not unlikely, since the soils in the research area are poor in phosphate [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the soluble UV screens and antioxidants, Bracken leaves are protected by the condensed tannins in the cell walls. The flavanones hesperidin and poncirin as well as condensed tannins were found in field-grown Bracken, but not in the greenhouse-grown Bracken with additional UV treatment. This might be due to the fact that not UV alone, but in combination with lower temperatures or other environmental factors, is responsible for induction of these flavonoids. In contrast, the formation of protective compounds in Setaria seems to be generally limited, and an effective increase in the UV screen with the elevation could not be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202255.s006">S2 Table</xref>). In summary, adaptive and non-adaptive chemical UV screens and antioxidants affect the fragile ecological equilibrium between Bracken and Setaria along the investigated elevational gradient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Outlook</title><p>One of the incentives for this study was the widespread loss of agricultural areas by the invasion of Bracken everywhere in the humid tropics. In the region of this study in the Andes of Southern Ecuador (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202255.g001">Fig 1</xref>), the area of Bracken-infested pastures increased from 9% in 1975 to 34% in 2001, and of Bracken-infested, already abandoned land from 5% in 1985 to 9.5% in 2001 [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Given the general competitive strength of tropical Bracken, the careful selection of useful plant species for cultivation in pastures is crucial. In neotropical pasture farming, grass species of the photosynthetic C4-type, like <italic>Setaria sphacelata</italic>, are used, e.g. <italic>Pennisetum clandestinum</italic> from Kenya in the lowlands (Kikuyu grass) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and <italic>Melinis minutiflora</italic> (molasses grass), an invasive species from tropical Africa [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], or the indigenous but low yielding <italic>Axonopus compressus</italic> (blanket grass) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, with respect to biomass production, all of these species are inferior to Setaria, leading to a steady increase of the area of this pasture type. Our study shows that at lower elevations, a photosynthetic C4-type grass species like Setaria can successfully compete with Bracken, but in areas above 1800 m a.s.l., sustainable pasture farming requires grass species with biomass production and competitive strength that are less dependent on the environment, in particular on the ambient temperature. Therefore, the use of a C3-grass which like Bracken can thrive well also at lower temperatures is obvious. Scattered populations of the globally widespread and climatically as well as edaphically robust C3-grass species, <italic>Holcus lanatus</italic> (common velvet grass or Yorkshire Fog) [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] are found in the upland pastures of the research area [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Common velvet grass is native to Europe and Asia [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] but used globally in pasture farming due to its constancy of biomass production and high grazing tolerance. Propagating by seeds as well as by tillers, it can form grass swards up to a meter tall. In contrast to its published low forage value [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], palatability as well as crude fat, protein and metabolic energy content, the samples from the research area might well be more favorable than those of Setaria. Therefore, <italic>Holcus lanatus</italic> might be a candidate for pasture farming in Bracken-infested tropical uplands [<xref rid="pone.0202255.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202255.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Undoubtedly, achieving sustainability in tropical pasture farming will mitigate the pressure on the remaining natural mountain forest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0202255.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Photosynthetic characterization of Bracken and Setaria in the field.</title><p>(A) Light-response curves of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> net uptake (<italic>A</italic>) of Setaria (solid lines) and Bracken (dashed lines). <italic>A</italic> was determined as dependent on the light intensity (PAR).
