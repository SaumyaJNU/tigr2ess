It is mainly focused on establishing vigorous cultivars with the fact that its deployment in crops necessitates the perspective of genomic impressions on prior selection for metric traits. In spite of extensive investigations, the actual mysterious genetic basis of heterosis is yet to unravel. Contemporary crop breeding is aimed at enhanced crop production overcoming former achievements. Leading cotton improvement programs remained handicapped to attain significant accomplishments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In mentioned context, a comprehensive project was designed involving a large collection of cotton accessions including 284 lines, 5 testers along with their respective F<sub>1</sub> hybrids derived from Line &#x000d7; Tester mating design were evaluated under 10 diverse environments. Heterosis, GCA and SCA were estimated from morphological and fiber quality traits by L&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;T analysis. For the exploration of elite marker alleles related to heterosis and to provide the material carrying such multiple alleles the mentioned three dependent variables along with trait phenotype values were executed for association study aided by microsatellites in mixed linear model based on population structure and linkage disequilibrium analysis. Highly significant 46 microsatellites were discovered in association with the fiber and yield related traits under study. It was observed that two-thirds of the highly significant associated microsatellites related to fiber quality were distributed on D sub-genome, including some with pleiotropic effect. Newly discovered 32 hQTLs related to fiber quality traits are one of prominent findings from current study. A set of 96 exclusively favorable alleles were discovered and C tester (A971Bt) posited a major contributor of these alleles primarily associated with fiber quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Hence, to uncover hidden facts lying within heterosis phenomenon, discovery of additional hQTLs is required to improve fibre quality. To grab prominent improvement in influenced fiber quality and yield traits, we suggest the A971 Bt cotton cultivar as fundamental element in advance breeding programs as a parent of choice.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5129-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Heterosis</kwd><kwd>L&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;T</kwd><kwd>GCA</kwd><kwd>SCA</kwd><kwd>Microsatellite markers</kwd><kwd>hQTL</kwd><kwd>Favorable alleles</kwd><kwd>Fiber quality</kwd><kwd>Cotton</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Junling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0101401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Xiongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Key Research and Development Program of China </institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0100203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Xiongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Science and Technology Support Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013BAD01B03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Xiongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par38">Cotton is a significant agricultural crop with high economic importance acting as a vital source for provision of income to large number of farmers around the world. Presence of diversity as well as agro climatic zones regarding cotton in China are comparably larger than any other country around the globe. Genus <italic>Gossypium</italic> covers economically sustainable and diverse amount of diploid as well as tetraploid cotton species grown in most of the regions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately 95% of cotton production in the whole world accredited with tetraploid <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> species mostly renowned as &#x02018;upland cotton&#x02019;. Most of the times breeders concerned with plants face the difficulty in selecting suitable parents and crosses while studying qualitative and quantitative traits responsible for yield.</p><p id="Par39">Based on phenotype only, parent selection procedure may prove faulty as phenotypically superior plants may lead to poor combinations. Integration of knowledge related to genetic basis of yield and quality traits of parents would definitely aid in the identification of superior cross combinations in earlier generations. Although cotton production has flourished significantly in recent decade however, the hybrid cotton yield is now at stagnation phase. Main reasons behind this scenario include lack of organized efforts for developing hybrid populations and derived lines with better combining abilities for establishing subsequent new hybrids.</p><p id="Par40">One of the major breakthrough in crop breeding era is large production of high yielding hybrids through wide exploitation of heterosis. Maize, sunflower, pearl millet, sugarbeet, sorghum and many other vegetables beneficially grown from their respective hybrids. However, areas under cultivation of rice, cotton, rapeseed and safflower are rapidly increasing. In open-pollinated crops such as maize, it is fundamental to establish heterotic populations and set grounds for improvement of combining ability to achieve sustainable productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. After its initial introduction and description, many researchers worked out intraspecific and interspecific heterosis in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] regarding fibre quality, reproductive cum vegetative growth and photosynthates manufacturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since longer times, producers and researchers are focusing on heterosis to use it as a major tool for raising fibre yield and quality of cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Earlier in 1894, heterosis in cotton accounting certain measurements of agronomic and fiber properties, was discovered and reported by Mell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], then Shull in 1908 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] gave its modern concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Hybrids between Upland and Egyptian cotton produce lint of superior quality. As in maize the yield increments are highly correlated with hybrid breeding, a parallel scenario has been observed in cotton. However, for the durable implementation of efficient procedures and basic genetic grounds of hybridization in cotton, much exploration is yet required to fill that gap which is one of the reasons for lagging behind of maize.</p><p id="Par41">China as well as India, both are large consumers of hybrid cotton, which has become possible due to advanced studies on heterosis aspect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adoption of hybrid cotton is rapidly increasing in China due to commercial release of Bt-cotton varieties. Nowadays hybrids (F<sub>1</sub>) of cotton in China are produced preferably from crossing of a non-Bt cotton line with a Bt cotton line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It has been scientifically proved that such type of crossing gives significant better-parent heterosis or Mid-parent heterosis especially in fiber yield components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">By exploiting the ambiguous mechanism of heterosis, many scientists have utilized inbred lines with suitable partners to produce elite hybrids with increased yield in different breeding programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, plant breeders examine inbred lines by reviewing their potential to produce elite hybrids and not by their performance per se.</p><p id="Par43">Hybrid performance cannot be precisely analyzed by line performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], verifying phenotypic trait assessment of hybrid crosses as liable. Such types of hindrances are typically sorted out by hybridizing inbred lines and &#x02018;testers&#x02019; (genetically distant) along with evaluating their (inbred lines) general combining abilities (GCA). Novel implements are required for precise prediction of GCA connected with highly polygenic parameters based on information derived specifically from parental inbred lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Mating designs play vital role in breeding of crops as they find their deliberate use in estimating GCA and SCA of parents and F<sub>1</sub>s. The line &#x000d7; tester is a simplest and efficient method utilized to breed all types of crop plants either self or cross pollinated in order to evaluate superior parents and favorable crosses along with their GCA and SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Many breeding programs utilized this method to achieve hybrid vigor for its commercial use. Analyzing combining ability is essential for the sake of selecting appropriate parents along with facts related to nature as well as extent of gene effects governing polygenic parameters. A successful hybridization program is highly dependent on the capability of parents involved to produce desirable recombinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Earlier reports unravel that additive and dominance effects laid the foundation of genetics related to heterosis for cotton yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In previous times, the trait value worked out using classical quantitative genetic methods. Consequently, dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], over-dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and epistasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] hypotheses relating heterosis came into being. With the advent of molecular markers in collaboration with extensive exploitation of QTL mapping for dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], over-dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as well as epistasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] theories greatly reinforced to analyze trait phenotype and heterosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Plant breeders are working hardly to mine the secrets lying behind this ambiguous process of heterosis, which is truly speaking genetically unclear so far. Many investigations have been conducted so far to explore the genetic grounds of heterosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Even then, investigators are enjoying the benefits of hybrids by exploiting it. Construction of saturated genetic linkage maps by utilizing molecular markers for the dissection of genetic components responsible for yield related complex traits through QTL (quantitative trait loci) analysis may substantially lead to comprehend the complex process of heterosis. Through association analyses, various yield related aspects of cotton have been mined thoroughly for the identification of significant alleles and carriers for breeding materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Variations existing in cotton genotypes identified via DNA markers have been related to significant heterosis results in order to utilize them in further hybrid breeding programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Many researchers in intra as well as inter-specific cotton hybrids for the sake of discovering the affiliation concerning hybrid performance and parental molecular marker diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] have investigated prediction of hybrid performance with the help of molecular markers.</p><p id="Par46">Cotton improvement programs remained handicap to attain significant achievements. We paced in this field for the exploration of elite marker alleles related to heterosis and to provide the typical material carrying such multiple alleles by integrating Line &#x000d7; Tester mating design with microsatellites based genome wide association mapping. Specific objectives of the current project were to investigate population structure of parents and hybrids, to discover the loci in F<sub>1</sub> hybrid individuals, associated with high heterosis influencing improved fiber yield and to identify elite alleles and the respective materials for further cotton improvement programs aimed at fiber quality and yield.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phenotypic evaluation and population structure</title><p id="Par47">Means and ranges of 10 traits evaluated in the field trials are given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

It was carried out based on correlation between agronomic and fiber traits. Ten principal components were extracted from the ten studied traits through PCA. The first three principal components were detected to reveal eigen value exceeding 1 while rest of the seven components showed less than one eigen value. The first and second principal components accounted collectively for 18.05% of total variation.

To attain this in logical manner, while dealing with relatively greater amount of variables an effective visual thinning (schematic visual summary) approach was utilized like in boxplot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], that reduces details in the middle in order to depict more significant statistics on univariate shape, center, spread and outliers. The eigenvalues of the first two principal components and correlation coefficients were extracted for each genotype (F<sub>1</sub>s and parents) and their studied traits by using R software package.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Evaluation of heterosis and combining ability</title><p id="Par94">The percent increase or decrease of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids over parent values were calculated using the formulas proposed by Fehr in 1987 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to estimate possible heterotic effects of the traits measured in the current study. The GCA variance of parents and SCA variance of hybrids were evaluated by following Line &#x000d7; Tester variance analysis as reported by Singh and Chaudhary in 1977 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Genotypic data analysis</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Population structure</title><p id="Par95">The Bayesian model-based program STRUCTURE&#x000a0;2.3.4 has been utilized to evaluate the population structure. The length of burn-in period and the number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) replications following burn-in were set at 100,000 having an admixture and allele frequencies correlated model. Ten independent run iterations were executed set with the hypothetical number of subpopulations (K) extending from 1 to 11. However, the outcomes represented a continuously increasing value of K with corresponding LnP(D) value. By integrating the probability data from [LnP(D)] obtained via STRUCTURE with &#x00394;K (ad hoc statistic), K value was precisely estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On the basis of this precise K, every genotype was given to the relevant subpopulation with membership value (Q value) &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and so Q-matrix (population structure) was created for further association mapping of marker and traits. For the STRUCTURE software, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; was used for fragments presence, &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; for fragment absence, and &#x0201c;-9&#x0201d; for missing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Association analysis and superior allele identification</title><p id="Par96">To estimate LD pattern in Upland cotton genome, the weighted average of squared correlation coefficient r<sup>2</sup> of each pair of microsatellites was calculated using the software package TASSEL 2.1 based on rapid permutations in 1000 shuffles with rare alleles (allele frequency less than 0.05) treated as missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Every loci pair was ranked as linked or unlinked with the basis regarding their presence on same or different chromosome respectively. For both types of linked and unlinked markers LD was calculated in parental populations and hybrid populations taken from STRUCTURE analysis. The 99th percentile of r<sup>2</sup> distribution for unlinked markers, which determined whether LD is due to physical linkage, was treated as the background LD level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The r<sup>2</sup> values of each pair of microsatellites were plotted against map distance (Mbp), and LD decay was estimated. By utilizing Sigmaplot version 12.5 an inner fitted trend line i.e., nonlinear logarithmic regression curve was sketched in order to elaborate the affiliation between r<sup>2</sup> and Mbp of microsatellites prevailing on single chromosome.</p><p id="Par97">Mixed linear model (MLM) was used to construct markers-fiber quality trait association tests using the TASSEL 2.0.1 software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For the TASSEL software, &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; designates presence of fragments, &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; specifies absence, and &#x0201c;?&#x0201d; designates missing value. The MLM association test was performed by considering Q-matrix and K-matrix simultaneously as followed by Yu et al. in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. False positive associations are significantly reduced by MLM model by considering the effects of both kinship and structure related to the material under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and gives P and r<sup>2</sup> values of each significant association.
