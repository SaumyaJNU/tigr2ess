Polyps showed glandular hyperplasia and distortion of architecture, cystic expansion with proteinaceous liquid or mucus. The mucosal lamina propria had vascular congestion, and was infiltrated by many eosinophils. These are typical histological features of CCS polyps.

Three years after CCS diagnosis, a colonoscopy demonstrated improvement in the number and size of polyps. However, a large ulcerated irregular polyp (3 &#x000d7; 4&#x0200a;cm) was discovered 30&#x0200a;cm proximal to the anus in the sigmoid colon. As so many polyps were difficult to be removed, only the largest polyps were biopsied. Histopathological examination of biopsies revealed high-level intramucosal neoplasia with tubular adenoma structure, but the epithelial hyperplasia and cellular morphology did not indicate intramucosal carcinoma, and did not penetrate the mucosa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Levels of CA199, CA125, and CEA were elevated (12.9&#x0200a;U/mL, 6.5&#x0200a;U/mL, and 7.56&#x0200a;ng/mL, respectively). The AFP level remained normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The surgical margin was negative, and 21 mesenteric lymph nodes were negative for metastases. The surrounding colonic mucosa contained tubular adenomas, and exhibited mild hyperplasia. Because the colon cancer staging was pT3N0M1 (IIA), in the absence of high risk factors, the patient did not receive any postoperative therapy, but was scheduled to be followed up regularly.</p></sec><sec><label>2.9</label><title>Liver metastasis</title><p>One year after colon cancer was diagnosed, an abdominal CT scan revealed mass lesions in the right lobe of the liver (8.8 &#x000d7; 4.5&#x0200a;cm, 36 HU on CT scan, 60 HU on CT-enhanced scan), which were considered to be metastases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A). The patient received 12 cycles of FOLFOX6 chemotherapy (oxaliplatin 175&#x0200a;mg d1 + fluorouracil 800&#x0200a;mg d1, fluorouracil 4000&#x0200a;mg civ, calcium folinate 800&#x0200a;mg d1) for 14 days.

Goto et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> reported that clinical manifestations of CCS can be divided into 5 types based on initial symptoms: I, diarrhea; II, taste abnormalities; III, dry mouth; IV, hair loss and nail atrophy; and V, loss of appetite, malaise, nail atrophy, hair loss, and dysgeusia in the absence of diarrhea. This patient presented with diarrhea as an initial symptom, and therefore was classified as having type I CCS. Because some clinical manifestations of CCS shared with other diseases, other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis, such as Cowden syndrome, a disorder characterized by multiple nonmalignant tumors in the GI tract<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> and elsewhere. Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing into certain cancers in the breast and thyroid.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> CCS polyps have a certain malignant transformation rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> CCS polyps are generally classified as juvenile type polyps, and these polyps rarely become cancerous. However, data have recently emerged suggesting that the risk of colon cancer in CCS patients ranges from 9 to 15%, with a 5-year mortality rate as high as 55%.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Most deaths of CCS patients were attributed to gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and congestive heart failure. This patient did not exhibit bleeding, sepsis, or heart failure, but did develop colon cancer, and liver metastases. This new information should be more carefully considered when treating CCS.</p><p>CCS is thought to be an autoimmune disease. Many studies have reported that autoimmune markers such as ANA, anticardiolipin, and/or aanti Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody are elevated in CCS. However, some patients also presented with no abnormal immunological markers.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> This report described one such patient in whom levels of ANA, ENA, and Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies were normal on admission, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal from the time of diagnosis up to September 2015.</p><p>CCS mainly affects the stomach and colon, but can affect other areas of the digestive tract.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Gastric polyps and colon polyps often coexist. Polyps are usually nodular, or of irregular shape, differ in size, and are widely distributed. There is not one characteristic pathological type of CCS. However, 4 histological types of polyps are found in CCS patients: hyperplastic, tubular adenoma, juvenile, and inflammatory. It has been reported that about 12.5% polyps undergo malignant transformation,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> highlighting the need to closely monitor these patients. The tumor markers CEA, CA125 are not particularly reliable, but can indicate occurrence, recurrence or metastasis of malignant tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>This patient was diagnosed with colon cancer 3 years after CCS diagnosis. It is possible that within this time, a CCS polyp underwent malignant transformation. However, given the size of the malignant tumor at the time of discovery, it seems more likely that a malignant polyp was present, but undetected at CCS diagnosis.</p><p>Progressive alopecia is one of the most characteristic dermatological manifestations of CCS. Progressive alopecia involves telogen effluvium, potentially resulting from shrinkage or atrophy of hair follicles. The histopathological findings are compatible with acute nonscarring alopecia, triggered by malnutrition, in CCS. Watanabe&#x02013;Okada et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> found that conversion from hair growth to arrest took place at quite an early stage of CCS, before hair loss was noticed.</p><p>The goals of CCS treatment include amelioration of diarrhea and weight loss, and improvement of ectodermal lesions. The most commonly used regimens include systemic hormone therapy and surgery. The effectiveness of hormone therapy has not been studied in large-scale trials, but is, nonetheless, the preferred drug regimen.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> After gastric or bowel resection, and endoscopic polypectomies, corticosteroid treatment can provide satisfactory effects. The mechanism by which corticosteroid therapy achieves its beneficial effects may involve decreasing inflammation in the GI tract, and suppressing the autoimmune response.</p><p>Corticosteroid therapy is an important component of CCS therapy, particularly for ANA positive patients. Sweetser et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> reported that 91% of CCS patients achieved remission, but relapse was common with steroid tapering. However, the corticosteroid doses used in the literature vary significantly, and no standard regimen has been widely adopted. Takakura et al<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> initiated CCS therapy with 30&#x0200a;mg prednisolone per day, and recommended the additional use of 1500&#x0200a;mg mesalazine per day as another anti-inflammatory agent. However, a standard dose adjustment protocol for prednisolone in CCS patients has not been established. Whether prednisolone therapy should be continued for life, or pulsed, remains controversial. In addition, some CCS patients who did not respond to steroids are reported to have been successfully treated with cyclosporine and azathioprine.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Treatment should, therefore, be individualized for each patient according to their symptoms and recorded response to previous therapy.</p><p>It should be noted that in the case of corticosteroid treatment, hormone reduction may be associated with the development of tumors. This patient was treated with tapering doses of dexamethasone, and the reduced dexamethasone dose may have contributed to malignant development while symptoms of CCS remained in remission. The patient was under strict surveillance, particularly for GI polyposis, but it remains possible that some lesions were overlooked during colonoscopy. Similar cases have previously been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>CCS is a rare disease in which nonmalignant tumors develop. These tumors have the potential for malignant transformation. CCS appears to be associated with abnormalities of the ectoderm. In addition to hormone therapy, regular follow ups are crucial to ensure early discovery of malignant tumors. Molecular markers for the early detection of malignant transformation could allow less invasive and more cost-effective surveillance of colon cancer, and are urgently sought. Studies with longer-term follow-up observations and larger sample sizes will be required to confirm these observations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CCS = Cronkhite-Canada syndrome, GI = gastrointestinal.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>This study was supported by the Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals&#x02019; Youth Program (code: QML20150107) (to Jing Wang), Rising Star Program from Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University (yyqdkt2014&#x02013;10) (to Jing Wang), the Capital Health Research and Development of special (2016&#x02013;4&#x02013;1112) (to Jing Wang), and the traditional Chinese Medicine Science and Technology Development Fund project of Beijing (QN2015&#x02013;10).
