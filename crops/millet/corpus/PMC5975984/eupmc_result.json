    "The eating habits of Jeju Island natives are quite different from those of the mainland people because of geographic isolation. Diet is a main factor affecting gallstone disease. We investigated the prevalence of gallstone disease in both Jeju Island natives and migrants and studied the risk factors affecting gallstone disease in the Jeju Island people.A total of 20,763 subjects who underwent medical checkups at the Health Promotion Center of Jeju National University Hospital in Korea from January 2003 to December 2015 were enrolled in the study. Ultrasonography was used to determine the presence of gallbladder stones. Body mass index and biochemical parameters, including liver function test results, lipid profiles, and fasting blood glucose levels, were verified, and data on age, birthplace, and sex were collected from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors affecting gallstone disease.The prevalence of gallstone disease in the Jeju Island people was 4.0%: Jeju Island natives, 3.8% and migrants, 4.4% (P=0.047). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent risk factors were older age, Jeju migrants, higher fasting blood glucose and alanine aminotransferase levels, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.The prevalence of gallstone disease was significantly lower in natives than in migrants from Jeju Island. Older age, Jeju migrants, higher fasting blood glucose and alanine aminotransferase levels, and lower highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels contributed to gallstone disease prevalence in the Jeju Island people."
