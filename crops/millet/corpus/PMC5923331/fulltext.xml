Introduction</title><p><italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> and <italic>Fusarium proliferatum</italic> are the main <italic>Fusarium</italic> species producing fumonisins, which contaminate mainly maize and maize products. Fumonisins were first isolated from maize by Gelderblom in 1988 [<xref rid="B1-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Fumonisin B (FB) is the main contaminant of natural cereal samples, with fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> accounting for approximately 70% of fumonisins; and fumonisin B<sub>2</sub> and fumonisin B<sub>3</sub> for approximately 20% and 10% [<xref rid="B2-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], respectively. To date, FBs have been found in foodstuffs, such as cereals [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], dried figs [<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], pine nuts [<xref rid="B5-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], coffee [<xref rid="B6-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], black tea, and medicinal plants [<xref rid="B7-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many studies have shown that FBs cause a variety of diseases in animals and humans, such as brain lesions in horses [<xref rid="B8-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], porcine pulmonary edema syndrome [<xref rid="B9-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and liver and kidney diseases in mammals [<xref rid="B10-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Considering its toxicity, many countries and institutions have established limits for FBs in agricultural products. For example, the maximum levels of total FBs (FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> + FB<sub>3</sub>) established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="B11-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: 2&#x02013;4 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 5&#x02013;100 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in human food and animal feed, respectively. The Scientific Committee on Food of European Commission determined that the human tolerable daily intake (TDI) for FBs (FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> + FB<sub>3</sub>) is 2 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight [<xref rid="B12-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Conventional methods for detecting FBs mainly involve chromatography and immunoassay. The most used chromatographic method for the determination of fumonisins is high performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection, after pre-column derivatization with <italic>o</italic>-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) reagent [<xref rid="B13-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A few of chromatographic methods, such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry [<xref rid="B16-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [<xref rid="B17-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], have also been reported to detect fumonisins. However, these techniques require the use of expensive apparatus, take a long time, and involve many skilled manipulations; therefore, chromatography analysis is limited in terms of the on-site detection of FBs in cereal samples. Compared with chromatography, immunoassay has the advantages of sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity. Indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to detect FB<sub>1</sub> [<xref rid="B18-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Colloidal gold immunochromatographic test strips are used to determine fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> in food and feedstuff samples, the LOD of the test strips is 50 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref rid="B19-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using a membrane-based flow-through immunoassay for the multi-detection of mycotoxins, the cut-off levels of 100, 1000, 1000, and 2500 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (&#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) have been achieved for a FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution, wheat, maize, and silage, respectively [<xref rid="B20-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The immunoaffinity test column (IATC) is a gel-based immunoassay derived from immunoaffinity chromatography [<xref rid="B21-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This type of assay has been used to non-instrumentally analyze pyrene in water samples [<xref rid="B22-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], ochratoxin A in beer [<xref rid="B23-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], chloramphenicol in food samples [<xref rid="B24-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and clindamycin residues in milk [<xref rid="B25-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The IATC can be combined with a clean-up column to analyze food samples with prominent matrix interference [<xref rid="B26-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxins-10-00165" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our study, a rapid and non-instrumental IATC assay was developed to analyze fumonisins and a silica-C18 clean-up column was used to eliminate the matrix interference from cereals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxins-10-00165"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.1. Development of IATC Assay</title><p>The color of the test layer (the anti-FB<sub>1</sub> antibody gel) conformed to the color of the control layer (the anti-horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) antibody gel) when the anti-FB<sub>1</sub> antibody gel and the anti-HRP antibody gel were diluted with the blocked gel at ratios of 1:20 and 1:30, respectively. The optimal dilution ratio of the FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP was 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01 mol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP and FB<sub>1</sub> in the sample solution could bond with the anti-FB<sub>1</sub> antibody in the test layer gels competitively. As the concentration of FB<sub>1</sub> in sample increased, the bond of FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP with anti-FB<sub>1</sub> antibody decreased. This resulted in the color of the test layer becoming weaker, or even colorless. The visual limit of detection (LOD) for the IATC assay was considered the lowest concentration of FB<sub>1</sub> at which the test layer showed no color. The blue color of the control layer indicated the reliability of the IATC assay. The assay was identified as invalid if the blue color did not develop in the control layer. The FB<sub>1</sub> standards were diluted in PBS (pH 7.4, 0.01 mol L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) to give various concentrations at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f002">Figure 2</xref>, along with the increase in concentration of FB<sub>1</sub>, the color of the test layer became weak. When the concentration of FB<sub>1</sub> was 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the test layer showed no color. The visual LOD for this developed IATC assay was 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>1</sub> in the assay buffer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.2. Specificity of IATC Assay</title><p>In this study, FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, FB<sub>3</sub>, AFB<sub>1</sub>, ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN), and T-2 toxin standards were used to assess the specificity of the IATC assay. The concentrations of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> were 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and the concentrations of AFB<sub>1</sub>, OTA, ZEN, and T-2 toxin were 1000 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The results of the IATC tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f003">Figure 3</xref>) showed that the color of the test layer and control layer was consistent for the high concentrations of AFB<sub>1</sub>, OTA, ZEN, and T-2 toxin, and the test layer was colorless at 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, the developed IATC assay had good specificity and equivalent recognition capability for FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, or FB<sub>3</sub>, and could be applied to detect the total concentration of FBs (FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> + FB<sub>3</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.3. Sample Analysis</title><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.3.1. Maize Samples</title><p>A blank maize sample and spiked maize sample (20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were extracted and 1 mL of the sample extracted solution mixed with FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP was analyzed using the IATC. The results showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) that a blue color appeared in the test layer and the control layer at the same time when detecting the blank sample, while it was colorless in the test layer when detecting the spiked sample. This indicated that the method was feasible to extract the FB<sub>1</sub> from the maize sample, and no matrix interference on the assay was observed. Finally, the visual LOD of FB<sub>1</sub> in the maize sample using IATC was 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.3.2. Barley Samples</title><p>Blank barley and spiked barley samples (20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were extracted and 1 mL of the sample extracted solution mixed with FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP was analyzed using the IATC. The result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f005">Figure 5</xref>A depicts the blue color that appeared in both layers for the blank sample and the spiked sample, which indicated a false negative result for the spiked sample. The extract method has proven feasible to extract FB<sub>1</sub> from a maize sample, so we considered that the barley sample extracted solution contained some impurities or proteins that may influence the IATC assay, and the barley sample extracted solution could not be directly tested by the IATC. Therefore, a clean-up column with different solid-phase materials was used to eliminate matrix interference.</p><p>The extracted solutions from the blank and spiked barley samples were flowed through the clean-up column (filled with strong anion exchange silica (SAX) sorbents), then 1 mL of purified sample solution was mixed with FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP and detected by the IATC. However, the test results still showed a false negative result when detecting the spiked sample: a blue color still appeared in the test layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). We considered that the purified sample solution still contained some soluble proteins or the FB<sub>1</sub> was absorbed by the clean-up column. Therefore, blank PBS solution and FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution (10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were flowed through the SAX clean-up column and detected by the IATC where the test result showed the test layer was colorless for the FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), which demonstrated that the SAX clean-up column did not absorb FB<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, we believe that the purified sample solution still contained some soluble proteins, which led to the test interference. A high concentration of sodium chloride was used to precipitate the soluble proteins in our study. Two grams of sample was added to 0.5 g NaCl and extracted using the extraction solution. The sample extracted solution was purified using the SAX clean-up column and the purified sample solution was mixed with FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP. One milliliter of the mixed solution was analyzed using the IATC. The result of the IATC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f005">Figure 5</xref>D) showed that there was a significant color difference between the spiked sample and the blank sample in the test layer: the test layer appeared an approximately colorless result for the spiked sample. Therefore, we considered that adding a high concentration of sodium chloride and the use of the SAX clean-up column were indispensable to eliminate the matrix interference in the barley sample extracted solution. The blank barley sample and spiked sample were added to NaCl and extracted without clean-up. The assay result showed that a blue color appeared in the test layer for the spiked sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f005">Figure 5</xref>E), which indicated that the matrix interference was not eliminated by just adding a high concentration of sodium chloride.</p><p>We also chose other sorbents (silica-C18, NH<sub>2</sub>-derived silica) to fill the clean-up column and to purify the sample extracted solution. We found that the clean-up column filled with SAX sorbents, could eliminate most of the matrix interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), but the trial using a clean-up column filled with silica-C18 showed that the silica-C18 eliminated the matrix interferences more completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). A trial using a clean-up column filled with NH<sub>2</sub>-derived silica did not remove the matrix interferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). Therefore, silica-C18 was chosen as the sorbent for the clean-up column for further experiments. As shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, the visual LOD of the IATC assay to detect FB<sub>1</sub> in the barley sample was 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot3-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.3.3. Oat and Millet Samples</title><p>Significant matrix interference on the IATC assay was observed for the analysis of the oat and millet samples. The addition of a high concentration of sodium chloride and use of clean-up column were applied. A blank sample and spiked sample (20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of oat and millet were extracted, then the extracted solution was passed through a clean-up column (filled with silica-C18), and 1 mL of the purified sample solution mixing with FB<sub>1</sub>-HRP was analyzed using the IATC. The IATC results of the oat and millet samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D. The left test column in each graph shows the IATC assay result for the blank sample, and the right test column in each graph shows the IATC assay result for the spiked sample. Finally, the visual LODs of the IATC assay to detect FB<sub>1</sub> in the oat and millet samples were 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>Due to the developed IATC assay had equivalent recognition capability for FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, or FB<sub>3</sub>, and it can detect the total concentration of FBs (FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> + FB<sub>3</sub>). That is to say, the IATC assay will provide a positive result when the total concentration of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> is equal to, or higher than 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (the visual LOD of FB<sub>1</sub> in cereal samples). Therefore, the visual LOD of the IATC assay to detect total fumonisins in maize, barley, oat, or millet samples was 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.4. Comparison of IATC and Commercial ELISA Test Kits for the Analysis of Cereal Samples</title><p>The maize, barley, oat, and millet samples were certified as negative FB samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a LOD of 7 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>1</sub>, of 3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>2</sub>, and of 3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>3</sub>. Spiked maize, barley, oat, and millet samples with FB<sub>1</sub> (0 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 100 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 500 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were tested using the IATC and the commercial ELISA test kit. The results of the IATC and ELISA test kit are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="toxins-10-00165-t001">Table 1</xref>. The IATC and the commercial ELISA test kit provided consistent results for the spiked cereal samples.</p><p>At the same time, the developed IATC assay with a clean-up column had a more sensitive LOD (20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) than the commercial ELISA test kit (100 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in the cereal samples. The developed IATC assay had a shorter and more convenient test procedure than the commercial ELISA test kit, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="toxins-10-00165-t002">Table 2</xref>. The IATC, the addition of a high concentration of sodium chloride, and the use of a silica-C18 clean-up column rapidly eliminated the matrix interferences and no large equipment was needed. However, the sample extraction solution required a process of centrifugation and a high ratio of dilution for the commercial fumonisin ELISA test kit. In addition, the IATC assay only needed an incubation of 1 min and a shorter wash process. In contrast, the commercial fumonisin ELISA test kit required a time-consuming incubation process; the incubation and wash needed to take 45 min. For the IATC assay, the color development process only needed to take 4.5 min, and the result could be judged directly with the naked eye without any instrument. However, for the commercial fumonisin ELISA test kit, the color development took 10&#x02013;15 min and the measure of absorbance values and data analysis needed at least 5 min by instrument. Finally, the total test time required for the IATC (approximately 10 min) was far less than that required when using the commercial fumonisin ELISA test kit (approximately 100 min). Thus, the developed IATC assay combining clean-up column in our study was simpler, quicker, and more sensitive than the commercial ELISA test kit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-10-00165"><title>2.5.

As we did not know the concentration of FBs in the real maize sample, each maize sample extracted solution needed to be diluted at running dilutions, then each diluted sample extracted solution needed to be detected subsequently by the IATC, and each test result needed to be compared with that result of the FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution in order to estimate the content of FBs in the real maize sample. As shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, a weak blue color was observed on the test layer of the test column at a 50-fold dilution of sample extracted solution in comparison with test column at 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution (the visual LOD of IATC for FB<sub>1</sub> in PBS), indicating that the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in maize sample No. 1 was lower than 1000 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However, its blue color intensity was weaker than that on the test layer of the test column at 5 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of the FB<sub>1</sub> standard solution, which illustrated that the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in maize sample No. 1 was higher than 500 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Therefore, the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in maize sample No. 1 detected by the developed IATC assay ranged from 500 to 1000 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. In the same way, the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in maize sample No. 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f007">Figure 7</xref>B) ranged from 1000 to 2000 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> ranged from 2000 to 4000 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for maize sample No. 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00165-f007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="toxins-10-00165-t003">Table 3</xref>, the detection results from the developed IATC assay agreed well with the results from the LC-MS/MS analysis, reflecting the good practicability of the developed IATC assay to detect the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in real cereal samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-toxins-10-00165"><title>3. Conclusions</title><p>In our study, the developed IATC assay proved to be a simple, rapid, and sensitive way to detect fumonisins in cereal samples without the need for special instruments. The visual LOD of this method was 10 &#x003bc;g L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for FB<sub>1,</sub> FB<sub>2</sub>, or FB<sub>3</sub> in the assay buffer. The developed method could be applied to detect the total concentration of FBs (FB<sub>1</sub> + FB<sub>2</sub> + FB<sub>3</sub>), and had a good specificity. The maize sample was extracted and analyzed by the developed IATC directly, and the visual LOD was 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. For the barley, oat, and millet samples, the addition of a high concentration of sodium chloride and the use of a silica-C18 clean-up column could eliminate the sample matrix influences. The visual LOD of the IATC assay in the barley, oat, or millet samples was 20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The IATC assay and the commercial fumonisin ELISA test kit gave consistent results for the analysis of the spiked cereal samples. The total contents of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in real maize samples detected by the developed assay agreed well with the results obtained by LC-MS/MS, reflecting the good practicability of this assay for detecting fumonisins in real samples. The IATC assay proved more sensitive and rapid; in particular, the LOD for the cereal samples (20 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) showed that the IATC assay was five-fold more sensitive than the commercial ELISA test kit (100 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and that the IATC test time (10 min) was approximately one-tenth that of the commercial ELISA test kit (100 min). With a simple sample pretreatment procedure and a rapid analysis process, the developed IATC assay allows for rapid, qualitative, and semi-quantitative detection of the total content of FB<sub>1</sub>, FB<sub>2</sub>, and FB<sub>3</sub> in cereal samples on-site.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-10-00165"><title>4.
