Using analysis of a well-preserved Early Bronze Age wooden container from Switzerland, we propose novel criteria for the identification of cereal residues. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified compounds typically associated with plant products, including a series of phenolic lipids (alkylresorcinols) found only at appreciable concentration in wheat and rye bran. The value of these lipids as cereal grain biomarkers were independently corroborated by the presence of macrobotanical remains embedded in the deposit, and wheat and rye endosperm peptides extracted from residue. These findings demonstrate the utility of a lipid-based biomarker for wheat and rye bran and offer a methodological template for future investigations of wider range of archaeological contexts. Alkylresorcinols provide a new tool for residue analysis which can help explore the spread and exploitation of cereal grains, a fundamental component of the advent and spread of farming.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">One of the challenges in identifying cereals through organic residue analysis is their relatively low content of chemically stable lipid compounds and high content of carbohydrate (starch) which is rapidly solubilized during cooking and quickly degrades in the burial environment. So whilst edible plants with oil rich seeds and epicuticular leaf waxes have been widely identified in ceramic vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, reports of cereals are notable by their absence. In some cases, more recalcitrant sterol and terpenoid compounds persist but these rarely offer any taxonomic resolution. One exception is the identification of miliacin in ceramics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, a pentacyclic triterpene methyl ether found in broomcorn millet (<italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic>). However, no such biomarkers currently exist for the identification of other cereals, such as maize, foxtail millet, rice and the major Western Eurasia crops of wheat, barley, and rye. Indeed, much of what we know of the history of cereals is derived from macro- and micro-botanical analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, typically charred grains or phytoliths, although this has now been extended by recovery of ancient DNA retrieved from wheat seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, botanical remains in archaeological sites have not always been systematically collected and archived, and their survival may be compromised by cooking practices, food processing and environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore these remains are usually found in contexts associated with plant cultivation, processing and storage rather than consumption. Yet, it is the latter which is particularly relevant to our understanding of the cultural value of these foods, particularly to distinguish their role as dietary staples, in the production of fermented products such as beer and bread, or even as exotic luxuries.</p><p id="Par3">The discovery of an Early Bronze Age wooden container from the summit of the L&#x000f6;tschenpass in Switzerland (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>) has provided a starting-point for the development of cereal specific biomarkers. The Alpine ice patch in which the artefact was found provides optimum conditions for biomolecular preservation. The wooden vessel contained an amorphous residue on its central surface (#137337; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). A mixture of spelt (<italic>Triticum spelta</italic>), emmer (<italic>Triticum dicoccon</italic>) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) could be microscopically observed embedded within the residue, evidenced by numerous fragments of wheat (<italic>Triticum</italic> sp.) testae, wheat pericarp, poorly-preserved spelt and emmer glumes, glume base (<italic>Triticum spelta</italic> and <italic>Triticum dicoccon</italic>), and one segment of barley rachis (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) geographic and local position of the artefact at the summit of the L&#x000f6;tschenpass (2650 masl); (<bold>B</bold>) the artefact showing the areas sampled for lipid and protein analysis.

</p><p id="Par4">In order to identify lipid components in the preserved residue, we applied gas chromatography mass spectrometry, a technique routinely applied to ceramic artefacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, following sequential extraction with dichloromethane:methanol to obtain a total lipid extract (TLE) and acidified methanol to obtain an acid extract (AE). Lipid analysis was also performed on samples of wood obtained from two extremities of the vessel (#137338, #137339) which served as controls (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Overall, a greater amount of lipid was recovered from the residue (#137337-AE~18.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, #137337-TLE~12.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) compared to the samples of wood (#137338-AE and #137339-AE~9.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 5.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> respectively; #137338-TLE and #137339-TLE~4.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and ~6.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> respectively). In addition, the distribution of fatty acids differed between the two sample types; the residue contained a range of fatty acids, principally C<sub>16:0</sub>, followed by C<sub>24:0</sub>, C<sub>26:0</sub> and C<sub>22:0</sub>, while the wood samples had a higher relative concentration of C<sub>18:1</sub>, followed by C<sub>16:0</sub>, C<sub>18:0</sub> and C<sub>20:0</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Partial total ion current chromatogram of lipid extracts from the residue (#137337) and the wooden artefact (#137338 and #137339) of total lipid extracts (left) analysed as TMS ethers and acid extracts (right) analysed as methyl esters using a DB-5&#x02009;ms column.

</p><p id="Par6">Extracts from the residue also contained high concentrations of plant/fungal sterols, particularly in the acid extracts (AE), including campesterol, ergostanol, &#x003b2;-sitosterol, stigmastanol, and degradation products of phytosterols (stigmastadiene, stigmastane-3,5-diene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>). Cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives were absent and consistent with a predominantly plant origin of the residue. The presence of 10-oxo-octadecanoic acid (10-oxo-C<sub>18:0</sub>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>) as detected as its methyl ester in the AE (m/z <bold>312</bold>, 156, 281, 214, 182) is most likely explained by microbial oxidation of C<sub>18:1</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, the wooden container contained coniferous resin, including predominantly isopimaric acid and abietic acid, along with degradation products due to aromatisation or oxidation, such as 7-oxodehydroabietic acid and dehydroabietic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These diterpenoid derivatives were not detected in the residue and therefore are most likely to be endogenous to the coniferous wood used to manufacture the container.</p><p id="Par7">Of particular relevance is the identification of a class of phenolic lipids, 1,3-dihydroxy-5-alkylbenzenes or alkylresorcinols (ARs) observed in the trimethylsilylated solvent extract (TLE) of the residue (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). Alkylresorcinols consist of an odd number of carbon atoms, typically C<sub>17</sub> to C<sub>25</sub>, in their alkyl chain, and are at high concentrations in the bran fraction of wheat and rye, although they are also found in lesser quantities in barley, millet, and maize bran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Whilst some bacteria also produce ARs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, a bacterial origin is much less likely given the absence of other bacteria derived lipid in the residue and the absence of ARs in the available control samples. Instead, the high relative concentrations of ARs in the residue (~1.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 1.5% of the TLE) and their association with other plant derived lipids strongly suggests that these compounds are derived from cereal grain.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Partial extracted ion chromatogram (m/z 268) showing homologues of alkylresorcinols (1,3-dihydroxy-5-alkylbenzenes) with alkyl chains of 17 to 25 carbon atoms in an extract of sample #137337-TLE; (<bold>B</bold>) selected mass spectra and structural information for 5-n-Heneicosylresorcinol TMS ester containing an alkyl chain of 21 carbon atoms.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_6390_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e572"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par8">Previous studies have shown that the ratio of the AR homologues C<sub>17:0</sub> and C<sub>21:0</sub> (C<sub>17:0</sub>/C<sub>21:0</sub>) differ markedly between wheat and rye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, with much higher relative amounts of C<sub>17:0</sub> in rye and that these ratios are not altered by food processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. ARs in the surface deposit were present with alkyl chains from C<sub>17:0</sub> to C<sub>25:0</sub>, but with a higher concentration of C<sub>19:0</sub> and C<sub>21:0</sub> homologues and a C<sub>17:0</sub>/C<sub>21:0</sub> of 0.02, closer to the value for wheat (C<sub>17:0</sub>/C<sub>21:0</sub>~0.1), compared to rye (C<sub>17:0</sub>/C<sub>21:0</sub>~1.0). This seems to indicate that wheat grain was the main source of these lipids, but we cannot exclude diagenetic alteration to the ratio of C<sub>17:0</sub>/C<sub>21:0</sub>, which should be assessed in the future through simulated degradation experiments. Interestingly, we found no evidence of compounds formed from the heating of fatty acids at higher temperatures, such as long-chain ketones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> or &#x003c9;-(o-alkylphenyl) alkanoic acids (APAAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore the grains were probably not subject to protracted heating, although it is thought that the isomerisation reaction needed to form the APAAs requires the presence clay minerals within ceramic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We are therefore confident in assigning the ARs attribution to wheat, which is broadly supported by the protein analysis. Finally, we note that ARs were not detected in the AE of the residue when derivatised to produce any trimethylsilyl ethers indicating that this commonly used screening approach is not suitable for detecting these compounds.</p><p id="Par9">To supplement this analysis and provide greater taxonomic resolution, we explored a shotgun proteomics approach to assess the survival of proteins. Although the application of proteomics to pottery is still in its infancy, both animal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and plant proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> have been recovered, even though some of the reported sequences are rather surprising e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>. Frustratingly, many biochemical products used in the laboratory are derived from &#x02018;foods&#x02019; (e.g. milk, blood) and may appear as common laboratory contaminants, and the assignment to a parent protein needs to be carefully considered. The combination of lipid and proteomic approaches to the same sample, provides a potential means of independently verifying protein survival. Protein extraction and analysis of the amorphous residue yielded a total of 47 confidently identified proteins, with 27 of plant origin, 6 common laboratory contaminants or experimentally derived proteins (keratins and trypsin, respectively) and 14 proteins of microbial or highly conserved origin. No milk or meat derived proteins were detected, consistent with the results from extracted fatty acids.</p><p id="Par10">Of the 27 confidently identified plant proteins, all but one were taxonomically assigned to grasses (SI2). More specifically, we were able to identify proteins belonging to the Triticeae tribe, and <italic>Triticum</italic> genus. In addition, protein basic endochitinase A matches taxonomically to the subtribe Hordeinae, a subtribe of Triticeae which consists of barley and rye (<italic>Hordeum</italic> sp. and <italic>Secale</italic> sp. respectively). The presence of these taxonomically distinctive peptides may indicate the presence of at least two grain types; wheat (<italic>Triticum&#x0feff;&#x0feff;</italic> sp.) and a member of the Hordeinae subtribe (i.e. Barley/Rye). Moreover, many of the identified proteins were tissue specific, with their expression being localised to the endosperm (grain) of the plant (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SI2</xref>). Comparing our results to the analysis of preserved foodstuffs by Shevchenko <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, some similar proteins, although different species, were detected, including serpins, xylanase and chymotrypsin inhibitors and oxalate oxidase. Looking at the functions of these identified proteins, the majority are related to plant defence, such as endochitinase, serpins, and amylase inhibitors. Quantitative whole proteome studies of developing wheat grains suggest that proteins related to defence are highly expressed at the mature stage of grain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. While the analysis in this study is not quantitative, the dominant presence of defence proteins could indicate that this plant-based residue is derived from cereals which were collected as mature, ripe grains. It should be noted that common domesticated species are well represented in reference sequence databases, and therefore other potential, unrepresented Hordeinae taxa would not be detectable by this approach. However, the protein results from this study are supported by the lipid and archaeobotanical analyses, providing compelling evidence for the presence of grain cereals in the vessel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par11">Although rarely preserved, the use of perishable containers, such as baskets or barrels, for the storage of cereals has been previously suggested in relation to the large accumulation of cereals grains frequently found in Bronze Age cave sites in the European Alps and surrounding areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These are thought to have been short-term repositories for storing grains, including millets, barley and wheats. Splint boxes are very rare and the only comparable artefact was found on another pass, the Schnidejoch, 25&#x02009;km to the West<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Neither of the artefact assemblages found on these two mountain passes includes pottery vessels, suggesting splint boxes and containers made of leather were the preferred method to carry provisions and equipment. This is also supported by the two bark containers associated with the Iceman found in the Tissenjoch (South Tyrol, Italy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In crossing high Alpine passes, the weight of the equipment was &#x02013; and still is &#x02013; of considerable importance.</p><p id="Par12">The L&#x000f6;tschenpass, along with a number of other passes in the Bernese Alps, connects the Western Swiss Plateau to the Valais valley, which in turn connects with the Italian Peninsula. A number of lake shore pile dwellings existed on the Swiss Plateau during the Early Bronze Age, while in the Valais the settlement record is thinner but the large number of Early Bronze graves show that the valley was not only settled but people imported goods from north and south of the Alps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this context, the wooden container found on the L&#x000f6;tschenpass can be linked with either trading connections or seasonal movements from lowland areas to upland pastures as part of the pastoral economy, although hunting could also explain the requirement to access such rocky and glaciated areas of the high Alps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We note that a biomarker for broomcorn millet (miliacin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>) was not identified in the residue. Further work utilizing different cereal biomarkers together with any archaeobotanical evidence, could be applied to understand the seasonal use of these passes, as millets appear in botanical assemblages in Europe from the 3rd Millennium BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> but are likely to be harvested at a different times of the year compared to wheat and barley.</p><p id="Par13">Our findings also raise important issues regarding the absence of evidence for cereals in pottery associated with ancient agricultural economies. Despite the thousands of ceramic artefacts submitted for lipid residue analysis, the evidence for cereals is extremely limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This fact is particularly intriguing as we know that cereals were of major economic importance since the emergence of farming and that they generally require extensive processing prior to consumption, which must have involved various types of artefacts, including pottery. However, the organic residue analysis so far undertaken suggests Bronze Age pots are largely associated with the processing of animal products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, similar to findings from the extensive analysis of Neolithic ceramic vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Whether this difference is attributable to generally poor preservation of molecular markers for cereal grains, such as the alkylresorcinols presented here, or due to real differences in the types of vessels used to store and process animal and plant foods, requires further analysis and experiments aimed at simulating use and degradation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Geographic and cultural setting</title><p id="Par14">The wooden vessel was discovered in 2012 near the summit of the L&#x000f6;tschenpass (2650&#x02009;m asl), in the western Bernese Alps (Switzerland) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>).

Results were adjusted to a 1% FDR and filtered to an ion score of &#x0003e;35, with protein identifications requiring a minimum of two peptides. Peptides identified by Mascot as being in the kingdom Plantae were aligned using BLASTp against all non-redundant nucleotide sequences and the taxonomy assessed using the BLAST Lineage Report.
