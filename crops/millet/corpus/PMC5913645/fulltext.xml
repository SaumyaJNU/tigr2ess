Most of the MPs showed considerable activity in regulating plant architecture, triggering leaf senescence, and inducing parasitic seed germination. Moreover, some MPs outperformed GR24, a widely used SL analog with a complex structure, in exerting particular SL functions, such as modulating Arabidopsis roots architecture and inhibiting rice tillering. Thus, MPs will help in elucidating the functions of SLs and are promising candidates for agricultural applications. Moreover, MPs demonstrate that slight structural modifications clearly impact the efficiency in exerting particular SL functions, indicating that structural diversity of natural SLs may mirror a functional specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Carlactone</kwd><kwd>methyl carlactonoic acid</kwd><kwd>plant architecture</kwd><kwd>root parasitic weeds</kwd><kwd><italic>Striga hermonthica</italic></kwd><kwd>strigolactones</kwd><kwd>tillering</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000865</named-content></funding-source><award-id>OPP1136424</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Strigolactones (SLs) are secondary metabolites originally identified as root-derived chemical signals inducing seed germination in root parasitic plants of the family Orobanchaceae (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Later, SLs were also shown to induce hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which is required for establishing beneficial AM symbiosis (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Akiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In the meantime, SLs were recognized as a novel class of plant hormones that determine different developmental processes, such as establishing shoot and root architecture, regulating secondary growth and inducing senescence (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Roldan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Umehara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ruyter-Spira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Beveridge, 2014</xref>). In addition, SLs are involved in pathogen defense and act as positive regulators of abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Torres-Vera <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Decker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Natural SLs are carotenoid derivatives consisting of a lactone ring (D-ring) that is connected by an enol ether bridge (in <italic>R</italic>-configuration) to a structurally variable second moiety (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Al-Babili and Bouwmeester, 2015</xref>). Canonical SLs, such as strigol and orobanchol, contain a tricyclic lactone (ABC-ring) as a second moiety and are divided, depending on stereochemistry of the B/C-junction, into strigol-like (&#x003b2;-orientation, up) and orobanchol-like (&#x003b1;-orientation, down) SLs (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Ueno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Besides the stereochemistry of the B/C-junction, various modifications of the ABC-ring, such as hydroxylation at different positions, lead to the diversity of canonical SLs. Non-canonical SLs, such as methyl carlactonoate (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), heliolactone (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Ueno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and zealactone (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Charnikhova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), do not have an ABC-lactone as a second moiety. The question of whether and how structural diversity leads to functional specificity of the around 25 known natural SLs is largely elusive (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Xie, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The availability of SL biosynthesis and perception mutants has enabled the elucidation of key steps in SL biosynthesis and perception (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Al-Babili and Bouwmeester, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lumba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). SL biosynthesis starts in plastids with the reversible <italic>cis</italic>/<italic>trans</italic>-isomerization of the precursor all-<italic>trans</italic>-&#x003b2;-carotene into 9-<italic>cis</italic>-&#x003b2;-carotene (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Alder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Bruno and Al-Babili, 2016</xref>). In the next step, the stereospecific carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7) cleaves 9-<italic>cis</italic>-&#x003b2;-carotene into the intermediate 9-<italic>cis</italic>-&#x003b2;-apo-10&#x02032;-carotenal and &#x003b2;-ionone (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Alder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bruno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Another CCD, CCD8, converts 9-<italic>cis</italic>-&#x003b2;-apo-10&#x02032;-carotenal via a combination of repeated dioxygenation and intra-molecular rearrangements into carlactone (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Alder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bruno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Carlactone is a central metabolite of SL biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Alder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Seto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and is the substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes of the clade 711, MAX1, in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Booker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), which catalyse the formation of canonical SLs, such as 4-deoxyorobanchol, and non-canonical SLs, such as carlactonoic acid (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In Arabidopsis carlactonoic acid is methylated by an unidentified methyltransferase into methyl carlactonoate (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the next step, methyl carlactonoate is hydroxylated by LATERAL BRANCHING OXIDOREDUCTASE (LBO) into an unidentified product that may be the final product in Arabidopsis SL biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Brewer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The rice MAX1, homolog carlactone oxidase, catalyses the conversion of carlactone into 4-deoxyorobanchol (<italic>ent</italic>-2&#x02032;-<italic>epi</italic>-5-deoxystrigol), the precursor of canonical, orobanchol-like SLs. Orobanchol itself is produced by another rice MAX1 homolog, the orobanchol synthase (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Al-Babili and Bouwmeester, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Strigolactone perception and downstream signaling involve the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-fold hydrolase DWARF14 (D14) (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hamiaux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">de Saint Germain <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which acts as a non-canonical receptor that covalently binds the D-ring of SLs during their hydrolysis. In addition, SL signaling requires the leucine-rich-repeat F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2)/DWARF3 (D3) (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Stirnberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), a subunit of a SKP1-CUL1-F-box-protein (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets repressors of SL signaling, such as Arabidopsis SUPPRESSOR OF MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 1-LIKE 6,7,8 (SMXL6,7,8) or rice DWARF53 (D53), for proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Soundappan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The F-box protein MAX2 is also required for signal transduction of karrikins, smoke-derived compounds that likely mimic an unidentified internal signaling molecule(s) and that inhibit hypocotyl growth and induce seed germination in various plant species but not in root parasitic weeds (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Karrikins share structural similarities (D-ring) with SLs and bind to the D14 paralog KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2), likely leading to proteasomal degradation of presumed suppressors (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Karrikin response is also triggered by the 2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>-configured stereoisomer of the common SL analog GR24 that is usually applied as a racemic mixture of 2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic> and 2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic> isomers (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Scaffidi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The genome of the root parasitic plant <italic>Striga hermonthic</italic>a encodes 11 D14/KAI2 homologs. It was recently shown that <italic>Striga</italic> KAI2 paralogs, especially ShHTL7, which constitute a distinct clade, are responsible for perception of host-released SLs and thus for triggering parasitic weed seed germination (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Conn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Tsuchiya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several parasitic <italic>Striga</italic> and <italic>Phelipanche</italic> species of the family Orobanchaceae are of great importance for agriculture. The <italic>Striga</italic> species <italic>S. asiatica</italic> and <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> infect cereals, including maize, sorghum, pearl millet, and rice, while <italic>Phelipanche</italic> species affect crops such as sunflower, tomato and legumes (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Parker, 2009</xref>). <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> is considered as one of the seven most severe biotic threats to food security, affecting subsistence and livelihood of 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Pennisi, 2010</xref>). <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> has been observed in 32 countries (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Rodenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) infesting an estimated 50 million hectares of arable land in the Sahel and savanna zones in Africa, causing annual losses of around 7 billion US$ (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ejeta, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Parker, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Related broom rape species, such as <italic>Orobanche crenata</italic> and <italic>Phelipanche ramosa</italic>, parasitize several non-cereal crops causing severe yield losses in the Mediterranean, central and eastern Europe, and Asia (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Parker, 2009</xref>). Heavy soil infestation with enormous numbers of long-lived, tiny seeds, and germination dependency of these seeds on host-derived signaling molecules has made control of these parasitic weeds very difficult (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Joel, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ejeta, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Delavault <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>During the evolution of parasitism, root parasitic plants have either totally lost or significantly reduced their capability for photosynthesis and, hence, cannot survive without a host plant that provides them with metabolites, water and minerals (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In this parasite&#x02013;host relationship, SLs are chemical signals required for the germination of parasite seeds, ensuring availability of an appropriate host (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ruyter-Spira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Such dependency on germination cues may provide opportunities for parasitic weed control. Induction of parasitic weed seed germination by exogenous application of germination stimuli before sowing crop seeds could, for instance, lead to the death of emerging parasite seedling (suicidal germination). This could be a promising approach to reduce the weed seed bank in soil. For this purpose, natural SLs are, however, not suitable candidates since they cannot be obtained from natural sources in sufficient quantities or at reasonable costs (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Zwanenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>b</italic></xref>). Moreover, organic synthesis of natural SLs is challenging, due to their complex structures that contain several chiral centers (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Kgosi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Zwanenburg and Posp&#x000ed;sil, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Zwanenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>). Hence, a prerequisite for implementing the suicidal germination approach outlined above is the availability of SLs or analogs/mimics that are easy to synthesize and that efficiently induce <italic>Striga</italic> seed germination (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Oancea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Dvorakova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). SL analogs could also be used in agriculture and horticulture, for instance, to direct water and other resources in one major branch by suppressing branching or tillering, to induce secondary growth, to enhance abiotic stress tolerance or to modulate root architecture (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), by increasing primary root length (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Agusti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). SLs also accelerate senescence (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), a functionality that might be exploited for the development of a new suite of herbicides.</p><p>Recently, we have reported on a carlactone-based SL analog, nitro-phenlactone, which has SL activity, but with different efficiency, indicating the possibility of establishing SLs analogs with specific functions (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In the present work, we developed a new series of SLs analogs, methyl phenlactonoates (MPs), which can be easily synthesized and which resemble the non-canonical SL methyl carlactonoate. Aiming at the identification of analogs that can be applied as suicidal germination agents and growth regulators or used in basic research to determine particular SL activities, we measured the stability of MPs, explored their activities in exerting different SL functions and investigated their affinity for SL receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Chemical synthesis of methyl phenlactonoates</title><p>All compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) synthesized here were produced and applied as a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers that differ in the configuration of the C2&#x02032; atom (2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic> and 2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic> configurations). For the synthesis of (<italic>E</italic>)-methyl 3-(4-methyl-5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yloxy)-2-phenylacrylate (MP3), we used a previously described protocol (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Mangnus <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992<italic>a</italic></xref>). Sodium hydride (372 mg, 3.32 mmol) was added to a cooled (0 &#x000b0;C) and stirred solution of methyl phenylacetate (2.0 g, 13.3 mmol) and methyl formate (1.1 ml, 18.0 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF; 27 ml) in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask. After 10 min, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight under elevated ambient nitrogen. Then the reaction mixture was cooled again with an ice bath, and 5-bromo-3-methyl-2(5<italic>H</italic>)-furanone (2.4 g, 13.3 mmol) in THF (5 ml) was gradually added.

Moreover, they play a key role in the life cycle of root parasitic weeds and in establishing the plant beneficial mycorrhizal symbiosis. Therefore, SLs have a great potential for application in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Sources of natural SLs are quite limited, since plants usually produce these compounds at very low concentrations (exudates of 300 000 sorghum plants were required to isolate only 5 &#x003bc;g of sorgolactone; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Humphrey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Moreover, organic synthesis of natural SLs is challenging, due to their complex structures that also contains several chiral centers (<xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Zwanenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Therefore, there is a need for low-cost and efficient SL analogs/mimics. Developing SL analogs with specificity for particular function(s) would also take an important step in translating SL research into potential applications.</p><p>We were particularly interested in developing SL analogs that can be applied as a suicidal seed germination agent to combat the root parasites <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> and <italic>P. ramosa</italic>. The suicidal germination approach would address a major constraint in the control of root parasitic weeds, which is the generally observed large size of seed bank of parasite-infested soil. Seasonal applications of germination stimulants in the absence of a host would gradually deplete this seed bank. This strategy has been recently tested in <italic>P. ramosa</italic>- and <italic>S. hermonthica</italic>-infested tobacco and sorghum fields, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Samejima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Zwanenburg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>). Results obtained from these field trials are promising and demonstrate the feasibility of the suicidal germination approach and consequently the importance of developing optimized SL analogs.</p><p>Most of our knowledge about SL functions was deduced from experiments performed with the widely used SL analog GR24. However, the synthesis of this compound is laborious and requires six to eight steps (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Mangnus <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992<italic>b</italic></xref>). Similarly, the synthesis of the potent fluorescent analog CISA-1 requires eight steps (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Other compounds, such as AR36 (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Boyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and 4-Br-debranone (4BD) (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Fukui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which contain a D-ring connected by an enol ether bridge to less complex second moieties, showed moderate activity in inducing parasite seed germination. Nijmegen-1 is a potent inducer of seed germination in <italic>P. ramosa</italic>, but with an EC<sub>50</sub> that is three orders of magnitude higher than GR24, it causes a weak germination response of <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Wigchert <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In this study, we developed a new series of SL analogs, MPs that resemble the non-canonical SL methyl carlactonoate. MPs are easy to prepare and very potent in inducing seed germination of <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> seeds and in exerting several SL developmental functions, such as inhibition of tillering, triggering senescence and regulation of root architecture in Arabidopsis.</p><p>Previously, we designed a carlactone-based analog, nitro-phenlactone, that showed very weak activity in stimulating <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> germination (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In this work, we modified the structure of nitro-phenlactone by replacing the methyl group by a methyl caroboxy group, which led to MP1, the most efficient <italic>Striga</italic> germination stimulant (EC<sub>50</sub>=1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;9</sup> M) among the MPs tested here. This activity was around 17 times weaker than that of GR24, pointing to MP1 as a suitable candidate for the suicidal germination approach. Very recently, we have evaluated the activity of MP1 in a trial conducted in Burkina Faso, in which we used 1 &#x000d7; 1 m<sup>2</sup> wooden boxes filled with artificially infested soil and pearl millet as a host. In this experiment MP1 showed significantly higher germination activity than GR24 (to be published). The activity of MP1 in inducing seed germination in <italic>P. ramosa</italic> was quite similar to that of GR24 and only slightly weaker than that of MP2, which carries the nitro group at the <italic>ortho</italic> position, and of the chlorophenyl compound MP8. Apart from these three compounds, we observed lower germination activity with <italic>P. ramosa</italic> seeds than with those of <italic>S. hermonthica</italic>.</p><p>To test whether MPs can recover the high-tillering phenotype of the SL-deficient <italic>d10</italic>/<italic>CCD8</italic> mutant, we used a hydroponic culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The tillering inhibition observed with all MPs in the <italic>d10</italic> mutant and insensitivity of the high-tillering perception mutant <italic>d3</italic> prove that these compounds act as SL analogs via the F-box protein D3/MAX2-dependent signaling pathway. The high activity of MP3 and MP7 prompted us to quantify the effect on tillering in more detail and to determine the corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> value. The results obtained demonstrate that both MP3 (EC<sub>50</sub>=2.98 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;9</sup> M) and MP7 (EC<sub>50</sub>=2.54 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> M) are more efficient than GR24 (EC<sub>50</sub>=4.83 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> M) in restoring wild type tillering to the <italic>d10</italic> mutant. MP1, which showed the highest activity in the <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> seed germination test, was weaker than GR24. We also observed that the treatment with several MPs (at 2.5 &#x003bc;M), particularly MP3, leads to growth retardation and senescence. Therefore, we tested the activity of MP3 in accelerating dark-induced leaf senescence, as reported for SLs before (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Yamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In this experiment, treatment with MP3 accelerated the change in leaf color and led to a decrease in chlorophyll content and an increase in electrolyte leakage, similar to GR24. Supporting data were also obtained by investigating the changes in transcript levels of the senescence-associated genes <italic>Osl295</italic> and <italic>Osl20</italic>. These results suggest the possibility of developing MP-based post-emergence herbicides.</p><p>The growth-promoting effect of widely used GR24 on primary roots is subtle and depends on the plant species and growth conditions (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ruyter-Spira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, it is less pronounced than the inhibitory effect of this compound on lateral root densities (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Matthys <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Our study on the activity of MPs on root architecture in Arabidopsis demonstrates that MP7 and particularly MP1 are more efficient than GR24 in inducing the growth of primary roots and reducing the lateral root density. These results suggest that MP1 and, to a lesser extent, MP7 are better analogs for investigating the role of SLs in regulating root architecture in Arabidopsis and, likely, in other species. Interestingly, nitro-phenlactone, which lacks the enone moiety, did not affect lateral root density as reported by <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Jia <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>. To our knowledge, MP1 is the first reported analog that outperforms GR24 in impacting root development.</p><p>Comparison of the activities of different MPs unraveled the impact of substitutions in the phenyl ring on the efficiency of these compounds in exerting specific SL functions. The lead compound, MP3, was less active than MP1 in inducing <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> seed germination but showed the most pronounced inhibitory effect on tillering. Substitutions increased the efficiency of the compounds in inducing seed germination and in regulating root architecture. Besides being the most potent compound in the <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> seed germination assay, MP1 also showed the highest activities in repressing the number of lateral roots and enhancing the length of primary roots, followed by the chlorophenyl-containing MP7 and MP8. The position of the modification is decisive. Among the chlorophenyl compounds, MP7, MP8, and MP9, we observed highest germination activity with MP7 (Cl in <italic>para</italic> position) followed by MP9 (<italic>ortho</italic> position) and MP8 (<italic>meta</italic> position).</p><p>To shed light on molecular events underlying the differences in activity between MP1, MP3, and MP7, we determined the affinity of <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> SL receptor ShHTL7 for these compounds. The results obtained were consistent with the <italic>S. hermonthica</italic> germination assay, with GR24 being the most active ligand followed by slightly weaker MP1, MP7, and finally MP3. However, we observed higher hydrolysis activities with MP3 and MP7 than with GR24. We also compared these compounds regarding their affinity and hydrolysis by the rice SL receptor D14. MP1 exhibited the highest hydrolysis rate and the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, followed by GR24, MP3, and finally MP7. It may be speculated that the high conversion of MP1 and MP7 is due to the presence of electron withdrawing groups NO<sub>2</sub> (MP1) and Cl (MP7), which alleviate the hydrolysis by the two receptors. In the case of ShHTL7 assays, hydrolysis and affinity results are consistent with the determined biological activity. In contrast, MP3 was the less preferred substrate in the incubations with OsD14, although it showed the highest activity in the tillering assay. This difference indicates that other factors, such as uptake and transport, are also decisive for the tillering inhibitory and growth retarding activity. However, it is also possible that hydrolysis rates determined here do not accurately reflect the situation <italic>in planta</italic> where D14 is part of a protein complex that may impact or modulate hydrolysis activity of this receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings showed that MPs are highly efficient SL analogs that can be used to investigate the biological functions of SLs and employed to combat root parasitic weeds or to modulate plant architecture. Moreover, our study demonstrated that type and position of substitutions in the phenol ring, which corresponds to the A-ring in SLs, determine and modulate the efficiency of MPs in exerting specific SL functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s23"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
