B510, a free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the stems of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv. Nipponbare), was investigated to establish effective conditions for the colonization of rice plants. We analyzed the effects of the nitrogen sources KNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, urea (CO[NH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>), and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> at different concentrations (0.01&#x02013;10 mM) on this colonization. Nitrogen promoted plant growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with minor differences being observed among the different nitrogen sources. Bacterial colonization was markedly suppressed on media containing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations higher than 1 mM. Since concentrations of up to and including 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> did not exhibit any antibacterial activity, we analyzed several factors affecting the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-dependent inhibition of endophytic colonization, including the accumulation of the reactive oxygen species H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the secretion of the chemotactic substrate malic acid. The accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was increased in rice roots grown on 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The amounts of malic acid secreted from NH<sub>4</sub>-grown rice plants were lower than those secreted from plants grown without nitrogen or with KNO<sub>3</sub>. Although the bacterium exhibited chemotactic activity, moving towards root exudates from plants grown without nitrogen and KNO<sub>3</sub>-grown plants, this activity was not observed with root exudates from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-grown plants. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, but not NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, caused the acidification of growth media, which inhibited plant bacterial colonization. These NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-dependent phenomena were markedly suppressed by the stabilization of medium pH using a buffer. These results demonstrate that the type and concentration of nitrogen fertilizer affects the colonization of rice plants by <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp. B510.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp.

The application of beneficial microbes can enhance plant growth and resistance to adverse environmental stresses, such as water and nutrient deficiencies and heavy metal contamination. One group of these microbes is referred to as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and some are commercially used as biofertilizers (<xref rid="b6-33_301" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b37-33_301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p><italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp., a well-studied member of PGPR, has been found in association with some of the world&#x02019;s most staple food crops, including rice, maize, sorghum, wheat, and millet (<xref rid="b14-33_301" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="b19-33_301" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b28-33_301" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="b34-33_301" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Members of the genus <italic>Azospirillum</italic> are widespread in soil and their inoculation on cereals and forage crops results in yield increases in many field experiments, not only due to nitrogen fixation, but also through the production of plant growth-promoting substances, such as the phytohormones indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (<xref rid="b2-33_301" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b22-33_301" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The inoculation of <italic>A. brasilense</italic> into <italic>Zea mays</italic> and <italic>Sorghum biocolor</italic> has been reported to enhance the uptake of mineral ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref rid="b28-33_301" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The uptake of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> was also enhanced in rice plants after an inoculation with <italic>A. lipoferum</italic> under hydroponic conditions (<xref rid="b31-33_301" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p><italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp. B510 (B510) is a diazotrophic endophyte that has been isolated from the stems of a rice plant (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv. Nipponbare) (<xref rid="b13-33_301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Increased seed production by B510-colonized rice plants was demonstrated under greenhouse, paddy field, and laboratory conditions (<xref rid="b7-33_301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b21-33_301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b37-33_301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Moreover, rice plants inoculated with this bacterium had induced resistance against rice blast disease and rice blight disease (<xref rid="b42-33_301" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Kaneko <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="b23-33_301" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) determined the complete genome sequence of B510; it has a single chromosome and six plasmids encoding 3,416 putative proteins, including putative genes encoding enzymes related to IAA biosynthesis and the reduction of host ethylene levels. A comparative metabolomic analysis revealed that rice plants inoculated with B510 induced a modified metabolic response in shoots and roots, suggesting that this bacterium triggers a systemic response against pathogens (<xref rid="b7-33_301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Consequently, the beneficial effects of B510 colonization in rice make it a useful biofertilizer. However, these beneficial effects were found to vary in field experiments, depending on both the rice genotype and nitrogen level (<xref rid="b37-33_301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Moreover, neither the mechanism by which this bacterium colonizes host plants nor the relationship between colonization and environmental conditions around the roots has been elucidated.</p><p>Nitrogen fertilizers, particularly ammonium, the form of nitrogen favored by rice, are widely used in rice cultivation; however, the influence of nitrogen fertilizers on the establishment of endophytic colonization by bacteria, such as B510, has not yet been clarified. Thus, to understand the relationship between nitrogen nutrition and endophytic colonization by B510 in rice plants, we performed physiological, histochemical, and microscopic analyses on rice-<italic>Azospirillum</italic> interactions. We found that high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> exert indirect suppressive effects on the colonization of rice plants by B510. We also propose a model to explain the mechanisms responsible for the effects of high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations on the plant redox state, rhizosphere acidification, bacterial chemotaxis, and host colonization by B510.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains used in the present study are listed in <xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>. <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp.

Potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl), urea (CO[NH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>), and ammonium nitrate (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries and the absence of a nitrogen source acted as a control.

They were observed and photographed using an Olympus IX71 fluorescence stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Each field was observed under three different conditions: optical light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy with a GFP field, and fluorescence microscopy with a Ds-Red field to confirm red fluorescence from DsRed&#x02013;labeled <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp.

To visualize hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), rice plants were placed in DAB solution (1 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DAB; Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) buffered with 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, at room temperature for 3&#x02013;4 h.

Quantitative measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were analyzed as described previously (<xref rid="b43-33_301" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Briefly, DAB-stained root samples (100 mg) were washed in 80% ethanol for 20 min and homogenized immediately in 500 &#x003bc;L of 0.2 M perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in a pre-cooled mortar.

The peaks obtained were compared with an array of standard malic acid peaks run under the same conditions. The major peak was identified by comparing the retention time with that of the matching standard. Standard malic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and root exudates (25 &#x003bc;L of each) were sequentially injected into the chromatographic system and run under the same conditions with four replicates per sample. Malic acid in the root exudate was identified by comparisons with the retention times of standard samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotaxis assay</title><p>The drop assay was performed as described in de Weert <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="b10-33_301" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) with slight modifications.

Bacterial cells were washed and resuspended in sterilized distilled water to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.0 and 1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added (final concentration, 0.25%). The cell suspension was transferred to a 90-mm Petri dish, on which it formed a 3-mm-thick layer. Concentrated (50-fold) root exudates or individual 100 mM organic acid components were added to the center of the dish as a 10-&#x003bc;L drop.

B510</title><p>Seedlings of <italic>O. sativa</italic> cv. Nipponbare were inoculated with the DsRed-labeled B510 strain to establish optimum conditions for endophytic colonization. Plants were grown in RG medium containing different concentrations (0.01&#x02013;10 mM) of each nitrogen source (KNO<sub>3</sub>, urea, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, or NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>). In most cases, rice roots inoculated with DsRed-labeled B510 showed strong red fluorescence under the fluorescence microscope (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Marked differences were not observed between 0.01 and 0.1 mM of each nitrogen source. Rice plants grown in more than 1 mM KNO<sub>3</sub> or urea exhibited strong fluorescence, indicating well-established bacterial colonization on root surfaces (epiphytic colonization). In contrast, red fluorescence was not detected in plants grown at NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations of 1 mM or higher, suggesting that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> suppressed bacterial colonization (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To further confirm these results, we counted the number of B510 cells on root surfaces. The number of B510 cells on root surfaces was 100-fold lower in 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated plants and 10,000-fold lower in 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated plants than in control plants without NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>We then examined the endophytic colonization of rice by B510 by counting the number of colonies within surface-sterilized whole plants 10 d post-inoculation (<xref rid="f2-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In rice plants grown on KNO<sub>3</sub>, the number of B510 cells became higher as the KNO<sub>3</sub> concentration increased (<xref rid="f2-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Although the root length was very short in RG medium containing 10 mM urea, endophytic colonization was clearly detected (<xref rid="f2-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). B510 colonized the inside of host roots with 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> CFU g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight at low concentrations (0.01&#x02013;0.1 mM) of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. However, endophytic colonization by B510 was markedly suppressed at high concentrations (higher than 1 mM) of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl with no detection (<xref rid="f2-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). B510 also colonized host roots with 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>5</sup> CFU g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight at a low NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentration (0.01&#x02013;0.1 mM), and only 10<sup>2</sup> CFU g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fresh weight or no detection at 1 or 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, respectively. These results indicate that high concentrations of both forms of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) have a negative effect on endophytic colonization by B510.</p><p>Since a high concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is known to have a toxic effect on bacteria (<xref rid="b3-33_301" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="b29-33_301" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), we investigated whether NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> inhibits the growth of B510 at the concentrations used in the colonization experiments. B510 was incubated in RG medium adjusted to pH 5.5 containing each concentration (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mM) of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. No significant differences were observed in bacterial growth among these concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, demonstrating that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> did not exhibit any antimicrobial activity against B510, which is in contrast to findings obtained using other bacteria (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). These results indicate that endophytic colonization by B510 was inhibited by high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, but also that high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> did not inhibit B510 growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. Bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are important for the attachment of the endophyte to the root surface (<xref rid="b30-33_301" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The establishment of a biofilm structure involves bacterial cells and EPS, which produce an optimal biosphere for the conversation of genetic material between cells. Thus, biofilms are of great importance in the plant-microbe interaction. The quantity of EPS in biofilms may comprise approximately 50&#x02013;90% of organic compounds (<xref rid="b11-33_301" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, B510 produced EPS or biofilms at similar levels regardless of the nitrogen source (NH<sub>4</sub>+ or NO<sub>3</sub>; <xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4A and B</xref>). This result suggests that EPS or biofilm-mediated attachment is not a key step in the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-dependent suppression of colonization.</p></sec><sec><title>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl induces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in rice roots</title><p>Plant-associated bacteria need to cope with host defense responses during infection.

The brown color that formed with DAB, which correlates with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, was more intense in roots that were grown in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl than in KNO<sub>3</sub> and the control (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Quantitative measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> revealed that NH<sub>4</sub>Cl induced significantly greater H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation than KNO<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulated with the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment, but that its production was slightly reduced by the inoculation with B510.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotactic responses to root exudates from plants grown with KNO<sub>3</sub> or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</title><p><italic>Azospirillum</italic> strains display chemotactic responses to specific substrates, such as root exudates, including organic acids (<xref rid="b33-33_301" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). To analyze chemotactic responses to root exudates secreted from rice roots grown in RG media without nitrogen (control) and with KNO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, we performed a taxis assay (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Root exudates extracted from control and KNO<sub>3</sub>-grown roots resulted in the formation of a bacterial ring in the plate assay, revealing a positive chemotactic reaction. However, the bacterial ring was not observed when root exudates from NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-grown roots were used (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The bacterial rings formed by the root exudates of B510-inoculated plants were slightly larger than those of the non-inoculated control, suggesting that the B510 inoculation stimulated chemoattractant production by roots (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, lower panels).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of malic acid in root exudates from plants grown with KNO<sub>3</sub> or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</title><p>Previous studies revealed that root-secreted malic acid (a chemotaxis substrate) recruits beneficial soil bacteria to promote binding and biofilm formation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="b35-33_301" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). B510 also responds to malic acid and other organic acids (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>). To investigate whether the amount of organic acids secreted by the roots increased 10 d after the B510 inoculation, we quantified malic acid secreted from the roots using HPLC. No significant differences were observed in the concentration of malic acid between control plants without the inoculation and B510-inoculated plants (<xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Although the amount of malic acid secreted from plants grown in KNO<sub>3</sub> without the inoculation was similar to that of plants grown in the absence of a nitrogen source with and without the inoculation, the amount of malic acid markedly increased when the plants had also been inoculated with B510 (<xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Malic acid was not detected in the root exudates secreted from non-inoculated NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-grown plants, whereas a small amount was detected in the root exudates of B510-inoculated plants grown with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that the B510 inoculation slightly increased the secretion of malic acid from rice roots although no significant difference was observed between inoculated and non-inoculated plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Acidification of the rhizosphere by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> affects endophytic colonization by B510</title><p>Nitrogen plays a prominent role in the cation-anion balance. It may be taken up by plants as a cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) or anion (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Previous studies demonstrated that plants supplied with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterbalance the corresponding excess of negative charges by releasing equivalent amounts of OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> into the rhizosphere, thereby increasing rhizosphere pH (<xref rid="b9-33_301" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b27-33_301" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Plants receiving NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> counterbalance the corresponding excess of positive charges by releasing equivalent amounts of H<sup>+</sup> into the rhizosphere, thereby decreasing rhizosphere pH (<xref rid="b20-33_301" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, we examined whether a pH change in the rhizosphere using different nitrogen sources affects the B510-endophytic colonization of rice plants. Before planting the seeds, the pH of RG medium was adjusted to 5.5. The acidification of RG medium after plant growth was clearly visualized using BPB, which changes from purple-blue to colorless when pH is between 3.0&#x02013;4.6 (<xref rid="f6-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The pH of control medium (without nitrogen) decreased slightly to pH 5.2 7 d after planting (<xref rid="f6-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In the cases of KNO<sub>3</sub> and urea, pH increased to 6.2 and 8.4, respectively. However, in the cases of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (in which H<sup>+</sup> is released), pH markedly decreased to pH 3 and RG medium de-colorized (<xref rid="f6-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The inoculation with B510 did not significantly affect pH (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> induced acidification around the rice rhizosphere. Therefore, the low pH caused by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> may inhibit endophytic colonization by B510.</p><p>To analyze the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-induced acidification on endophytic colonization by B510, we tested the addition of MES buffer to RG medium, which was expected to prevent a decrease in pH. Without MES buffer, the pH of RG medium containing NH<sub>4</sub>Cl decreased to 3.4 (<xref rid="f6-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In RG medium containing NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and MES, pH was maintained at 5.5 (<xref rid="f6-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and endophytic and root surface colonization by B510 was not inhibited under higher concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> tested (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="f2-33_301" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Furthermore, the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decreased in rice roots grown with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and MES (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). A chemotactic response by B510 was observed with exudates extracted from roots grown with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and MES (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, malic acid secretion was increased by the B510 inoculation in exudates from roots grown with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and MES (<xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These results indicate that the pH decrease induced by NH<sub>4</sub>
<sup>+</sup> inhibited endophytic colonization by B510. We then performed a bacterial growth test using NB media adjusted to different pH levels (pH 3&#x02013;8). The results obtained indicated that acidic media with pH&#x0003c;4 suppressed the growth of B510 (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). These results imply that acidification directly affects the bacterial growth of as well as endophytic colonization by B510.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Endophytic bacteria invade internal plant tissues through sites of injury in the epidermis, root tips, and root cracks formed at the sites of lateral roots, and some endophytic bacteria spread to distant plant organs (<xref rid="b5-33_301" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b36-33_301" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp. B510 was isolated from the stems of rice (<xref rid="b13-33_301" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that B510 colonized the interior of rice roots using orthogonal optical sections (<xref rid="b7-33_301" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the present study, we observed strong red fluorescence around lateral root emergence sites by fluorescence microscopy using DsRed-labeled B510, suggesting that <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp. B510 invades through this site and then spreads to stems and leaves (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We did not detect any surface colonization by B510 in the roots under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The fluorescence of DsRed is known to decrease under mildly acidic conditions (pH 4.0&#x02013;4.8) (<xref rid="b39-33_301" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In our experiments, high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> acidified the rhizosphere to a pH of 3.0&#x02013;3.9, suggesting the quenching of DsRed under acidic conditions. Consequently, we confirmed decreased colonization by B510 on root surfaces from plants grown with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>concentrations higher than 1 mM using a plate dilution method (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p>A microscopic analysis also showed the non-uniformity of colonization by B510 on the root surface (<xref rid="f1-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A previous study on non-uniform colonization by endophytic bacteria used the term &#x02018;carpet-like structure&#x02019; to describe its appearance (<xref rid="b44-33_301" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). This appearance may be explained by numerous factors, such as various root exudation patterns and bacterial quorum sensing effects, as well as chemotactic responses, twitching motility, exopolysaccharide production, and ROS-scavenging enzymes (<xref rid="b1-33_301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b4-33_301" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b8-33_301" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b29-33_301" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Azospirillum</italic> spp. exhibit strain-specific chemotactic responses to organic acids (<xref rid="b33-33_301" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In B510, we observed a chemotactic response to rice root exudates and organic acids, and plants inoculated with B510 secreted more chemotactic compounds than non-inoculated plants (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This strain strongly responds to oxalic acid (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3h</xref>). The different chemotactic responses among strains has been linked to the adaptation of the bacteria to the nutrient conditions provided by the host plants (<xref rid="b33-33_301" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Biofilms or EPS have great importance in plant microbe interaction. Biofilm integration of bacterial cells convert or adapt their habitat by generating extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, reduced growth rates, regulate the quorum sensing and the up- and down regulation of specific genes. B510 produced EPS at similar levels regardless of the nitrogen source (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or NO<sub>3</sub>; <xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). This suggests that EPS-mediated attachment may not be a key step in the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> dependent suppression of colonization. Our results suggest that B510 in the soil moves towards the host plant, and after stable colonization using EPS, induces host plants to increase their secretion of compounds such as organic acids, which the bacteria then use for their growth.</p><p>Rice plants need large amounts of nitrogen, especially for growth of above-ground tissues, such as leaves. Generally, chemical fertilizers such as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, or urea are applied directly to the plant roots in order to maximize absorption. Rice plants have the capacity to utilize both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="b24-33_301" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="b26-33_301" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although the growth of above-ground rice tissues is similar with the application of either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, in our study, the growth of roots is suppressed dramatically by high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>, plant growth suppression by B510-inoculation was observed under some conditions. Previous studies reported that B510 enhanced rice growth and yield (<xref rid="b21-33_301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), however, the positive effects of B510 were dependent on the plant growth condition. Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic> (2010) showed the negative effects of B510 on rice cv. Nipponbare underin a low nitrogen fertilizer-applied field (<xref rid="b37-33_301" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Since RG medium does not contain many nutrients, the B510 inoculation may induce stress in rice plants by competing for nutrients. Moreover, the B510 inoculation caused root tip curling (shown in <xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This morphological change may also cause the growth suppression of rice plants.</p><p>B510 did not grow under acidic conditions (pH&#x0003c;4), suggesting that rhizosphere acidification by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> contributes to the inhibition of bacterial colonization. Plants maintain a neutral intracellular pH (pH 6&#x02013;7) even when the rhizosphere is acidic (<xref rid="b25-33_301" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="b32-33_301" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, in the present study, endophytic colonization by B510 was not observed when the rhizosphere was acidic. This result suggests that B510 resides in the intercellular spaces of host roots rather than intracellularly and, thus, bacterial infection is affected by extracellular pH changes. The optimal pH for the growth of B510 is pH 5&#x02013;7, as is that of other <italic>Azospirillum</italic> sp. strains (<xref rid="s1-33_301" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>; [<xref rid="b12-33_301" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]).</p><p>Host-derived ROS are key factors controlling the bacterial infection of host plants. Endophytic bacteria possess ROS-scavenging enzymes to allow successful infection. Genome data shows that B510 has two superoxide dismutases (<italic>sod1</italic>: AZL_024870, <italic>sod2</italic>: AZL_014560) and a glutathione reductase (<italic>NADPH</italic>: AZL_a04110). These two enzymes are essential for endophytic colonization by <italic>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</italic> PAL5 (<xref rid="b1-33_301" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In the present study, rice plants constitutively produced the ROS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, at higher levels under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This result implies that B510 overcomes transient and low-level ROS production by the host plant using these types of ROS-scavenging enzymes, but also that it cannot overcome constitutive and high-level ROS production by the host under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations. However, the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was significantly decreased in rice roots grown with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and MES (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), and endophytic colonization by B510 was not suppressed in these rice roots. These results suggest that high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations inhibit colonization by B510 not only through acidification, but also with the accumulation of high levels of ROS production.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> inhibited the endophytic colonization of rice by B510. We propose a model to explain the mechanisms by which this phenomenon occurs (<xref rid="f7-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In this model, root-mediated pH changes, caused by the application of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, result in acidification around the rice rhizosphere. Low pH (&#x0003c;5.0) decreases root growth, increases H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation (<xref rid="b45-33_301" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and inhibits the secretion of chemotactic organic acids in root exudates, thereby suppressing the growth of and colonization by this bacterium. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production is reduced in plants grown in the presence of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and inoculated with B510 (<xref rid="f3-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The biosynthesis of malic acid was increased in plants grown in the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and inoculated with B510 (<xref rid="f5-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), and their root exudates exhibited enhanced chemotactic activity (<xref rid="f4-33_301" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This result indicates additional benefits to those identified in previous studies, in which B510 enhanced plant growth and plant disease resistance (<xref rid="b21-33_301" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="b42-33_301" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These beneficial traits make B510 a superb source of biofertilizer.</p><p>Recent studies reported that rice plants fertilized with nitrogen contribute to environmental pollution (such as eutrophication) by emitting ammonia in Japanese rice paddies, which is caused by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="b16-33_301" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="b17-33_301" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the present study, endophytic B510 cells were maintained at high numbers by controlling the pH of the rice rhizosphere using a buffer, and the roots also secreted more chemotactic compounds. Future studies will be directed towards the identification of the optimal combination of nitrogen fertilizers and B510 inoculation to promote the sustainable production of crops such as rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="s1-33_301"><media xlink:href="33_301_s1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1462" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

The bacterial chemotactic response was triggered after an incubation at room temperature for 10 min. A response correlated with the appearance of a ring of turbidity near the center of each Petri dish. Scale bars=1 cm.

The consequent acidification of the rhizosphere suppresses the secretion of chemotactic substrates, including malic acid, by the roots. As a result, the growth of bacteria, such as B510, is markedly suppressed. Moreover, acidification induces the production of ROS, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, by the plant roots. This suppresses colonization by endophytic bacteria, such as B510.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="33_301_7"/></fig></floats-group></article>
