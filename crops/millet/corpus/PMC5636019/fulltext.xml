It is domesticated independently in ancient Mesoamerica and the Andes; although widely cultivated in hot climate throughout the world. It is available in white, black and reddish colour varieties in kidney shaped <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The bean plants (legumes) belong to the genus Vignasavi, and the family Leguminosae-papilionoidae and the tribe Phaseoleae which is made up of about 80&#x02013;100 species <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. They grow in the tropics and Asia Common bean usually refers to food legumes of the genus Phaseolus, family Leguminosae, subfamily Papilionoideae, tribe Phaseoleae, and subtribe Phaseolinae. The genus Phaseolus contains some 50 wild-growing species distributed only in the Americas (Asian Phaseolus have been reclassified as Vigna) <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Beans in general, are important sources of macronutrients, micronutrients and antioxidant compounds with a great potential for human and animal nutrition <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. .However, they contain several anti-nutritional factors which limit their consumption and affect the digestibility and bioavailability of nutrients <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The cooked beans are generally used in flavorful foodstuff throughout the world, some other species of red beans and cow peas were consumed as vegetables in some parts of the country <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The large quantity of red beans are widely consumed, even though they are poorly digested and cause flatulence due to the presence of several biologically active compounds (phytochemicals) such as phytic acid, tannins, saponins and lectins which could limit their consumption <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The flatulence associated with red beans is mainly caused by oligosaccharides, particularly raffinose, stachyose and verbascose. Plant foods are fermented to enhance or create unique flavors, to change textural properties and to improve quality and digestibility. Fermented foods are an essential part of the human diet in many parts of the world, especially in Southeast Asia, the Near East and parts of Africa <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="par0030">Microorganisms used for fermentation process of food products are capable of growing on a wide range of substrates. That can produce a remarkable spectrum of products and bioactive components, which enhance the biofunctionality of food products <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The relatively recent advent of in vitrogenetic manipulation has extended the range of products that may be produced by microorganisms and has provided new methods for increasing the yields of existing ones <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Thus fermentation in food processing is defined as the conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol and carbon dioxide or organic acids using yeast and/or bacteria, under anaerobic conditions <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The fermentation technology depends on the microbial components and produces different molecules from small laboratory scale to large industrial scale. Fermentation of beans has not been extensively studied but it has been shown to produce a reduction in bioactive compounds (phytochemicals), positive effects on protein digestibility, texture and aroma and an improvement in the biological value of legumes <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In spite of all these studies, there is still little formation concerning the use of open and controlled fermentation in P vulgaris in the developing country <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Especially on the eastern and great lakes part of Africa, where such beans are consumed in large quantities. In order to improve the nutritional quality of the red beans produced in developing regions as food/feed resources, removal/reduction of unwanted components from beans using different processing methods like fermentation is a desirable and often the easiest method.</p><p id="par0035">The main aim of the work is to determine the reduction or elimination of flatulence-causing sugars and the enhancements of in vitro protein digestibility by natural and controlled fermentation.

The value for magnesium in the anger flour sample is higher than values reported by most authors for some legume <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Magnesium is an activator of many enzyme systems and maintains the electrical potential in nerves <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Phosphorus is always found with calcium in the body both contributing to the blood formation and supportive structure of the body. Modern foods rich in animal protein and phosphorus can promote the loss of calcium in urine. This led to the concept of calcium phosphorus ratio. If the Ca/P ratio is low, calcium will be low and there will be high phosphorus intake which leads to calcium loss in the urine more than normal. If the Ca/P ratio of any food is above one that food is considered &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; if the ratio is less that 0.5, Ca/P ratio above two helps to increase the absorption of calcium in the small intestine <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

The open and controlled fermentation increased the protein digestibility to about 90% in all samples. This result was consistent for Loko, with an initial protein digestibility value of 65% and was increased to around 84% after the fermentation process. Red bean fermentation resulted in the reduction of phytates, trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), saponins, tannins and raffinose oligosaccharides. Fermentation offers unique nutritional advantages for making the protein of coarse-grained red beans more digestible by reducing its bioactive compounds. The tannins were more difficult to breakdown by fermentation and a maximum of 45% reduction was achieved. Open fermentation had a better effect on the breakdown of the oligosaccharides, raffinose and stachyose. Furthermore, it does not require the use of pure cultures which might be costly even if they are available. It is also concluding that 96&#x000a0;h is sufficient time for fermentation. The chemical compositions are found to less for Loko red beans after fermentation, but mineral contain is more as compared to anger red beans. The outcome of this investigation is that open fermentation process is one of the simple and feasible processes to improve the biochemical properties and mineral content of local available beans. The product obtained can be marketed as dried beans powder for extruded products that can be sold at eateries.</p></sec><sec id="sec0090"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="par0130">Author wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choy</surname><given-names>S.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>K.M.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>T.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramanan</surname><given-names>R.N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A review on common vegetables and legumes as promising plant-based natural coagulants in water clarification</article-title><source>Int.
