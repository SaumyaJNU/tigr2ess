    "Phaseolus vulgaris L. beans have been characterized as a nearly perfect food in all around the world. It is consider functional in terms of providing nutrients and energy to sustain daily life. Red bean contain high protein, mineral, fibres and chemically diverse micronutrient composition, which can be affected by processing. The main aim of this work is to investigate the effect of open and controlled fermentation on the proximate composition, mineral elements, antinutritional factors and flatulence- causing oligosaccharides of a domesticated bean (Anger, conscope and Loko). Open fermentation was done using endogenous microorganism present in the seed of beans, while controlled fermentation was done on autoclaved beans flour inoculated with thermophilic lactic culture which is a mixed strain culture containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus thermophillus. The result shows that the open and controlled fermentation increased the protein digestibility up to 90% in all samples and 4Â days of fermentation time, loko red bean was found to more suitable. The chemical compositions and mineral contain was also high as compared to remaining two verities."
