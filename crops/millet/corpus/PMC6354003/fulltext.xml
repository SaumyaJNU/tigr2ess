The optimization of IAA production was carried out at different pH and temperature with varied carbon and nitrogen sources of culture media.

The thin layer of soil immediately surrounding the root of a plant is an extremely important area for root activity and metabolism and is known as the rhizosphere. It is home to a number of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and algae whereby bacteria outnumber the else by a huge margin. Plants select those bacteria which are beneficial for their growth by release of particular organic compounds through root exudates <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> thus creating a very selective environment where only a limited species of bacteria can survive and hence diversity is low <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This happens due to the corresponding ability of bacteria to utilize these compounds <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, rhizosphere acts as a unique ecological niche for each plant and those beneficial bacteria associated with plants are referred to as plant growth promoting bacteria. A number of bacterial species belonging to <italic>Azospirillum, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium</italic> and <italic>Serratia</italic> have been found to be associated with rhizosphere and are able to exert beneficial effects on plant growth <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0010">Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main member of auxins family produced by plants as it plays an important role in a number of plant activities such as leaf formation, embryo development, root initiation and development, abscission (falling of leaves), phototropism, geotropism, fruit development, etc. IAA helps in the enhancement of root length with increase in number of root branches, root hairs and root laterals that aid in uptake of nutrients from surrounding <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Since IAA has been found to be very important for plant growth and development, extensive studies have been performed on IAA after its discovery as a plant hormone. It has been found out that different bacteria, fungi and algae are capable of producing physiologically active amounts of IAA. IAA is synthesized by plants and microbes via a number of interrelated pathways of which tryptophan dependent pathway is the best understood. <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As plants grow, they release many water-soluble compounds such as amino acids, sugars and organic acids. So the rhizospheric bacteria get abundant supply of substrates required for secondary metabolite production of which IAA is one.</p><p id="p0015">In this study, the one factorial approach has been employed for optimization by varying one factor and keeping all the others fixed during the trial. The aim of this study was to isolate IAA producing bacteria and to increase IAA production by varying different physiological parameters such as pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources, so that we get the intended conditions at which the IAA production is maximized. IAA does not function as a hormone in microbial cells (PGPRs) but their ability to produce the same might have evolved because of its importance in plant microbe relationships. The present study reports optimization of growth parameters for IAA production by PGPRs isolated from rhizosphere of <italic>Stevia rebaudiana.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Isolation of bacteria from rhizospheric soil</title><p id="p0020">Soil samples were collected from the BIT Medicinal plants garden and Institute of Forest Productivity, Garhkhatanga, Ranchi, Jharkhand.

Several bacterial colonies appeared whereby the morphologically distinguishable colonies were picked and streaked on nutrient agar plates. Re-streaking was carried on until pure cultures were obtained. IAA-producing isolates were selected by growing them in IAA production medium as described below. The isolate producing maximum amount of IAA was further selected for the optimization of IAA production. Finally, selected isolates were named according to their collection sites and analyzed for various plant growth promoting activities.

A range of pH 5&#x02013;9 was examined for its effect on IAA production by different isolates. Temperature is also an important parameter for IAA production since the growth of bacteria affected by low or high temperature and IAA production is dependent upon the correct growth of microorganism. Thus, its production was tested at 25, 30, 35, 37, 40 and 45&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C at 120&#x0202f;rpm. Five different sugars viz.

Recent study <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> reported a 13.4-fold improvement in IAA production by Enterobacter sp. DMKU-RP206. Enterobacter sp. DMKU-RP206 produced a higher amount of IAA than previously reported for the genus Enterobacter. 0.85% of lactose as a carbon source, 1.3% of yeast extract as a nitrogen source, 1.1% of l-tryptophan as a precursor, 0.4% of NaCl, an initial pH of 5.8, an incubation temperature at 30&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C, and a shaking speed of 200&#x0202f;rpm were found to be the optimum conditions for IAA production. In a similar study <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> antagonistic <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PS24 showed multiple plant growth promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and HCN production. Another recent study <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> showed the production of IAA by enteric bacteria <italic>Salmonella</italic> which is also colonizing plant tissues and help in interaction with plants and animals which also provides new incentives to gain insight into the function of this plant hormone in a larger biological context. The results of this work suggest that the <italic>Salmonella ipdC</italic> (indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase) contributes to the production of IAA in laboratory cultures and this gene is expressed during root colonization, and that the product of the reaction involving <italic>IpdC</italic> activates plant auxin-responsive promoter.</p><p id="p0100">To study the effect of PGPR on plant growth, seeds of different crop plants were treated with isolates CA 1001, CA2003 and CA2004. Isolates CA1001 and CA 2004 showed better response on treating the seeds of mungbean with production of 39.33&#x0202f;mg of dried root biomass compared to control as 16.66&#x0202f;mg in mungbean plant, whereas in wheat it was 19.66&#x0202f;mg by isolate CA1001. Isolate CA2004 also showed correspondingly good result in mungbean plant with generation of 36.66&#x0202f;mg of dried root biomass. And there is higher root biomass produced as compared to wheat and sorghum. Isolate CA 2003 gave better result in wheat and Sorghum with generation of 14.66&#x0202f;mg and 11.33&#x0202f;mg of dried root biomass respectively. Similarly, dried shoot biomass of 43&#x0202f;mg and 41&#x0202f;mg were also obtained in mungbean plant when seeds were treated with isolates CA 1001 and CA 2004 respectively followed with 19.6&#x0202f;mg in wheat. In millet and sorghum no prospective results were obtained.</p><p id="p0105">The property of IAA production by rhizobacterial isolates is considered as effective tool for screening beneficial microorganisms and they have profound effect on plant growth <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Previous studies also confirmed the involvement of rhizobacterial isolates in enhancing the plant growth by synthesizing IAA. Root elongation was found to occur in <italic>Sesbania aculeata</italic> by inoculation with <italic>Azotobacter</italic> spp. and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., in <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> by <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, in <italic>Vigna radiate</italic> by <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>
<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and in <italic>Pennisetum americanum</italic> by <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic>
<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Effect of IAA producing isolate was also observed in <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> where it significantly increased the shoot and root biomass and chlorophyll (a and b) contents as compared to control plants. In another study <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> PGPR applications had desirable effects on plant growth. It revealed the effect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain (AK20 and AK31), <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> strain (AK18 and AK45) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain (AK38) in rice, caused significant variations between weight and length of shoot and root (see <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effect of varied isolates on root biomasss production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig><fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Effect of varied isolates on shoot biomasss production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0110">Present study showed that maximum yield of IAA was obtained at pH 9 (91.7&#x0202f;&#x000b5;g&#x0202f;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and at temperature 37&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C (81.7&#x0202f;&#x000b5;g&#x0202f;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) by isolate CA1001. Dextrose (1%) was found to be the best carbon source for isolate CA1001 with 104 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IAA production. Isolate CA 2004 showed maximum production of 51 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> IAA at 0.75% ammonium nitrate. Isolate CA 2004 showed best production of IAA 36&#x0202f;&#x000b5;g&#x0202f;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 34 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1.5% and 1% Beef extract respectively. Isolate CA 1001 showed 32&#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> production of IAA at 0.5% nicotinic acid concentration. From the current study, CA1001 and CA2004 emerged as noble alternative for IAA production further which also resulted in root and shoot biomass generation in crop plants, hence can be further used as bio-inoculants for plant growth promotion. Further studies are required to explore more on production of IAA by rhizosheric bacteria and study their effect on various crop plants in the field where plants are exposed to various abiotic and biotic factors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>The Rhizosphere</chapter-title><year>1990</year><publisher-name>John Wiley &#x00026; Sons</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Chichester, Sussex, UK</publisher-loc><fpage>458</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barriuso</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Solano</surname><given-names>B.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>J.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lobo</surname><given-names>A.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a-Villaraco</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma&#x000f1;ero</surname><given-names>F.J.G.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Ecology, genetic diversity and screening strategies of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)</chapter-title><year>2008</year><publisher-name>Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.
