    "The phenomenological expression showing crop yield to be directly dependent on crop transpiration use efficiency (TE) has encouraged continued focus on TE as a viable approach to increasing crop yields. The difficulty in the phenomenological perspective is that research tends not to match up with the underlying mechanistic variables defining TE. Experimental evidence and the mechanistic derivation of TE by Tanner and Sinclair showed that the common focus on increasing the intrinsic ratio of leaf CO2/H2O exchange has limited opportunities for improvement. On the other hand, the derivation showed that daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD) weighted for the daily cycle of transpiration rate has a large, direct impact on TE. While VPD is often viewed as an environmental variable, daily weighted VPD can be under plant control as a result of partial stomatal closure during the midday. A critical feature of the partial stomatal closure is that transpiration rate is decreased resulting in conservation of soil water. The conserved soil water allows late-season, sustained physiological activity during subsequent periods of developing water deficits, which can be especially beneficial during reproductive development. The shift in the temporal dynamics of water use by water conservations traits has been shown in simulation studies to result in substantial yield increases. It is suggested from this analysis that effective water use through the growing season is more important for increasing crop yield than attempts focused on improving the static, intrinsic TE ratio."
