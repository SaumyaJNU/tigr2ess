    "BACKGROUND:WRKY transcription factors (TFs) participate in various physiological processes of plants. Although WRKY genes have been well studied in model plants, knowledge of the functional roles of these genes is still extremely limited in cotton. RESULTS:In this study, a group IId WRKY gene from cotton, GhWRKY42, was isolated and characterized. Our data showed that GhWRKY42 localized to the nucleus. A transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that GhWRKY42 was not a transcriptional activator. A Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) activity assay revealed that the promoter of GhWRKY42 showed fragment deletion activity in Nicotiana tabacum and was mainly expressed in the roots, stems and leaves of ProGhWRKY42::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that GhWRKY42 was up-regulated during leaf senescence and was induced after exposure to abiotic stresses. Constitutive expression of GhWRKY42 in Arabidopsis led to a premature aging phenotype, which was correlated with an increased number of senescent leaves, reduced chlorophyll content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). In addition, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was used to silence the endogenous GhWRKY42 gene in cotton, and this silencing reduced plant height. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings indicate that GhWRKY42 is involved in abiotic stress responses, premature leaf senescence and stem development. This work establishes a solid foundation for further functional analysis of the GhWRKY42 gene in cotton."
