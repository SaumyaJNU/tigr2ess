    "The present case report described the initial diagnosis of a 25-year old female with a brain abscess consisting of two lesions 0.2 and 2.9 cm3 in volume. The patient was initially treated with antibiotics; however, 2 months following initial treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and she became vegetative. Following transfer to the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University (Jilin, China) the two lesions had grown in volume to 9.0 and 13.0 cm3, respectively. The results of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and plasma 1-3-Î²-D-glucan activity suggested a possible fungal infection. Subsequently, a stereotactic biopsy was conducted, fluid was cultured and itraconazole treatment was initiated. Analysis of cultures confirmed a Candida glabrata infection and antifungal treatment was continued. Shortly following surgery, the patient regained consciousness and the ability to eat and speak. A follow-up MRI 8 months following biopsy confirmed disappearance of all lesions and no recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first English-language report of a brain abscess caused primarily by Candida glabrata."
