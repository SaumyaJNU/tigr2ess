    "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is one of the principal staple for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa serving as the main sources of protein. However, protein digestibility is low in sorghum and this may be affected by processing methods. In this study 15 sorghum cultivars and one variety each of maize (Zea maize) and tef (Eragrostis tef) all of Ethiopian origin were investigated for in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), activity and concentration of anti-nutritional factors and micro nutrient profile in raw flour and various cooked food samples. Kafirin composition content and composition was also determined from raw flour samples of the sorghum cultivars. IVPD was significantly different between genotypes with both maize and tef superior to sorghum both in cooked and uncooked state except for the high lysine genotype Wetet Be-gunchie. Cooking significantly reduced IVPD in all crops but had only minor effect in maize. Results revealed a highly significant interaction between genotype and food processing methods where, occasionally, genotypes with highest IVPD under one processing method ended up to be the lowest under another. Trypsin inhibitor levels had a significant and negative correlation with IVPD (r2 = 0.1), while changes in phytic acid concentration and intrinsic phytase levels during processing followed opposite trends to each other. Processing increased mineral levels by 20-44% for iron and 4-29% for zinc perhaps due to degradation of phytic acid. Results demonstrated that protein digestibility and the concentration of anti- nutritional factors varied widely depending on the food type. Identification of specific genotypes for a specific food product may help improve the nutritional quality of sorghum based foods."
