The extracts of <italic>Bael</italic> (<italic>Aegle marmelos)</italic> flower were examined for their phenolic content, free radical scavenging efficacy and inhibition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxidation and DNA scission activities. The extracts of <italic>Bael</italic> flowers were prepared using different solvent systems and their total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) determined. Selected extracts which showed high TPC were subsequently used to determine their efficacy in scavenging hydroxyl, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The corresponding peroxyl radical scavenging activity was measured using oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. The potency of the extracts in inhibiting hydroxyl and peroxyl radical-induced supercoiled DNA scission and inhibition of LDL cholesterol oxidation was also evaluated. The chemical identity of phenolic compounds present in the extracts was tentatively unraveled using HPLC-MS. Phenolic extracts of <italic>Bael</italic> flowers effectively inhibited hydroxyl, and peroxyl radicals. Phenolic extracts demonstrated notable inhibitory activity against hydroxyl and peroxyl radical-induced DNA scission and LDL oxidation. Vanillic, <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, chlorogenic, caffeic, and gentisic acids were identified as major phenolic acids, along with flavonoids, mainly catechin, and quercetin.

They also penetrate into an emerging niche market&#x000a0;along with other beverages. A majority of herbal beverages are prepared from natural ingredients using different morphological parts, namely leaves, stems, roots, fruits, buds and flowers of plants. The type of herbal beverages popular in different regions of the world could be different and may be affected by local habits and availability of certain plants. Herbal teas/beverages are rich sources of natural bioactive compounds such as carotenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids, polyacetylenes, saponins and terpenoids, among others. Health Canada categorizes herbal beverages under natural health products (NHPs).</p><p id="p0015">Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body causes oxidative stress, a detrimental cascade of events leading to the oxidation of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA in organisms. Oxidative stress is now well known for its pivotal role in the etiology of several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, and diabetes, different types of cancers, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p id="p0020">Studies have shown that major cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a significant increase of vascular production of ROS and lipid oxidation<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In addition to the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), there are a number of additional, likely important, oxidative events in cardiovascular disease (CVD). For instance increased ROS production has been identified as a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which is associated with a rapid loss of anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (&#x000b7;NO) in part due to its inactivation by superoxide. In addition, ROS are involved in signaling cascades leading to vascular pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic gene expression.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> It is known that some dietary constituents may provide protection against cancer by eliminating/neutralizing certain ROS that damage DNA or initiate cancer. Therefore, external sources of antioxidants are required to prevent oxidative damage in the human body once internal antioxidant defense systems are challenged by over exposure to free radicals and other ROS. Phenolic compounds which are ubiquitous in plant foods and beverages as well as spices and herbs are known for their antioxidant and other bioactivities such as antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-thrombotic and vasodilatory action, as well as anti-mutagenicity, anti-carcinogenicity and anti-aging effects.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p id="p0025"><italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> is a tropical plant belonging to the family <italic>Rutaceae</italic> and is grown in Southeast Asian countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Thailand.
