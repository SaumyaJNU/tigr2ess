Kranz anatomy is associated with many C<sub>4</sub> plants in which bundle sheath cells surround the veins and are themselves surrounded by mesophyll cells. This specialized Kranz anatomy is elucidated as an important contributor to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic activities in C<sub>4</sub> plant. Characterizing the molecular basis of Kranz structure formation has become a key objective for studies of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. However, severe mutants that specifically disrupt Kranz anatomy have not been identified. In this study, we detected 549 stable ethyl methane sulfonate-induced foxtail millet (cultivar Yugu1) mutants related to leaf development and photosynthesis among 2,709 mutants screened (M<sub>3</sub>/M<sub>4</sub> generation). The identified mutants included 52 that had abnormal leaf veins (with abnormal starch accumulation based on iodine staining). Each of the 52 mutants was characterized through an analysis of leaf morphology, and through microscopic observations of leaf tissue sections embedded in resin and paraffin. In total, 14 mutants were identified with abnormal Kranz structures exemplified by small bundle sheath cell size. Additional phenotypes of the mutants included poorly differentiated mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, increased vein density and the absence of chloroplasts in the bundle sheath cells. Kranz structure mutations were accompanied by varying leaf thickness, implying these mutations induced complex effects. We identified mutations related to Kranz structure development in this trial, which may be useful for the mapping and cloning of genes responsible for mediating Kranz structure development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>foxtail millet</kwd><kwd>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Kranz structure</kwd><kwd>EMS mutant</kwd><kwd>leaf mutant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31522040</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100005196</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">Y2016XT05</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">Y2017JC15</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">CAAS-XTCX2016002</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Ministry of Agriculture of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004573</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">CARS-06-13.5-A04</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Photosynthesis, the driver for life on this planet, includes many carbon fixation pathways (e.g., C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, and crassulacean acid metabolism). In all photosynthetic pathways, a bi-functional enzyme-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is needed to fix CO<sub>2</sub> into carbohydrates. The C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway completes the initial and secondary CO<sub>2</sub> fixations using two distinct photosynthetic cell types, which form a distinct CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism that significantly improves the carboxylation efficiency of Rubisco. Consequently, C<sub>4</sub> plants exhibit a higher photosynthetic efficiency, biomass production, and water and nutrient usage than C<sub>3</sub> plants under hot, dry conditions that favor stomatal closure (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Saha and Blumwald, 2016</xref>). These characteristics enhance the ability of plants to grow in increasingly arid environments and decrease the need for fertilizer applications. However, many agriculturally important crops, such as rice, wheat, soybean, and potato, are C<sub>3</sub> plants. Thus, the suggestion that introducing the C<sub>4</sub> pathway into C<sub>3</sub> plants may improve productivity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Rizal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) prompted the initiation of The C<sub>4</sub> Rice Project<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup> by a group that included leading rice researchers. Promising results have included the successful transfer of genes encoding key C<sub>4</sub> pathway enzymes into C<sub>3</sub> plants to improve photosynthetic efficiency (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ku et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Chi et al., 2004</xref>). However, researchers have been unable to generate C<sub>3</sub> plants with a highly efficient CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism even after transferring one or more genes encoding C<sub>4</sub> cycle metabolic enzymes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Westhoff and Gowik, 2010</xref>). This inability has been partly due to a lack of a leaf Kranz structure, which is important for the spatial separation of enzymatic activities related to carbon fixation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kromdijk et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>All grass family C<sub>4</sub> crops have a typical Kranz structure (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Christin et al., 2013</xref>) consisting of an inner layer of relatively large bundle sheath cells around a vascular bundle. The bundle sheath cells are surrounded by a layer of mesophyll cells that are compactly arranged to form a concentric ring-shaped structure. These are generally only two mesophyll cells between vascular bundles in C<sub>4</sub> leaves as opposed to up to 18 cells in C<sub>3</sub> leaves (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Sage et al., 2014</xref>). Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of Kranz structure has been the focus of research into C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Langdale, 2011</xref>). Some researchers have examined genes differentially expressed between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) or tissues (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Other studies of C<sub>4</sub> plants have applied genome and transcriptome sequencing techniques to analyze bundle sheath and mesophyll cells (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Li J. et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Covshoff et al., 2013</xref>) at different developmental stages (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li P. et al., 2010</xref>). These studies identified several differentially expressed genes between leaf development stages before and after the formation of the Kranz structure, and between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Although these studies have suggested several candidate genes, no functional tests of these candidates have revealed regulators of the process.</p><p>Geological studies (e.g., involving carbon isotopes) and phylogenetic analyses of various species have suggested that C<sub>4</sub> plants evolved from C<sub>3</sub> plants, with structural and gene expression changes having occurred over time. More than 66 independent events took place that caused some C<sub>3</sub> plants to evolve into C<sub>4</sub> plants, which is considered as the best example of convergent evolution (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hibberd, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sage et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Rizal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Christin and Osborne, 2013</xref>). The first stage of this evolution involved structural changes, including the development of a higher leaf vein density, larger bundle sheath cell volume, as well as increased abundance and altered localization of organelles (e.g., chloroplasts and mitochondria) in bundle sheath cells. Additionally, genes encoding specific enzymes (e.g., PEPC and GDC) began to show cell-type specific enrichment. Moreover, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurred first in the outer leaf cells, after which the carbohydrates derived from CO<sub>2</sub> were fixed in the inner bundle sheath cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mckown and Dengler, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sage and Zhu, 2011</xref>). Studies revealed that some positive/negative regulators in the developing endoderm might have been important for the formation of C<sub>4</sub> structures (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski et al., 2012</xref>). Researchers have mined for genes related to the development of C<sub>4</sub> structures by selecting and identifying mutants, including maize mutants with abnormal leaf veins (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski et al., 2012</xref>), rice mutants with increased leaf vein density (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2014</xref>), and sorghum mutants with decreased leaf vein density (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rizal et al., 2015</xref>). Several transcription factors that help regulate BSC differentiation in C<sub>4</sub> species have been identified, including SCR and SHR (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Gardiner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Maize and sorghum have been important model organisms in studies of C<sub>4</sub> plants, but they are large plant species with complex genomes. In contrast, green foxtail and foxtail millet are small in stature and have simpler genomes. Foxtail millet originated in the Yellow River basin of China, and represents a domesticated form of green foxtail. The self-pollinating diploid foxtail millet exhibits characteristics that make it useful for research, including a high seed set per spike, compact size, simple growth condition requirements, relatively small genome (490 Mb), and a high transformation efficiency. Therefore, this plant species is gradually being used as a new model organism for studies of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic mechanism (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Doust et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Diao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Saha and Blumwald, 2016</xref>). Mutant lines exhibiting abnormal development of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic structures may be very important for identifying and cloning of responsible genes. In this study, genetically stable ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants generated using the Yugu1 cultivar were analyzed for screening of changes in leaf appearance and vein density, sugar accumulation, and Kranz structural features. Mutants with abnormal leaf veins and Kranz structures were identified, and may be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying Kranz structure and development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tested Materials</title><p>We previously developed EMS-based methods for mutagenizing foxtail millet (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li W. et al., 2010</xref>) to establish a stable mutant library for foxtail millet cultivar Yugu1.

The wild-type Yugu1 leaves were dark green with a uniformly arrayed leaf vein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Meanwhile, leaf mutants produced abnormal leaves in terms of striped, shape, and color (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">P</xref>). Abnormal striped (mainly white and yellow) were the most commonly observed leaf mutations. In some cases (e.g., <italic>t81</italic> and <italic>t104</italic>), white striped were present on the whole leaf (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). Some mutants (e.g., <italic>t11</italic>) produced leaves with several large white striped (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), while other mutants (e.g., <italic>t71</italic>) had normal-sized leaves that were covered with slender white striped (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In some cases (e.g., <italic>t6</italic>), mutants grew thin flag leaves with yellow striped (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Other mutants (e.g., <italic>t53</italic>) had thin yellow striped at the leaf tip, but the rest of the leaf was normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Some mutants produced leaves with abnormal sizes and shapes, including <italic>t17</italic>, which had relatively small leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>) and <italic>t57</italic>, which had narrow leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). In mutants with abnormally colored leaves, some produced completely yellow leaves (e.g., <italic>t124</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>), while others had leaves that were yellow only at the tip (e.g., <italic>t72</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>).

For example, severe brick-red rust was detected on all leaves of some mutants (e.g., <italic>t121</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>), while other mutants had small punctum spots (e.g., <italic>t33</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>) or black rust spots (e.g., <italic>t35</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>) on the leaves.

Additionally, leaf veins that could not be clearly distinguished were observed in narrow white striped mutants (e.g., <italic>t189</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). The striped of these leaf mutants that were visible to the naked eye and the unclear veins observed by microscopy might be related to the abnormal development of cell structures. Moreover, this could also be the result of plastid mutations (similar to iojap and japonica of maize) or may be due to epigenetic effects of the mutagenesis. This possibility should be the main research focus of future studies involving the screening of leaf vein mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results of Iodine Staining</title><p>To more clearly observe the changes in leaf vein structure, the mature leaves from 549 plants were stained with iodine. The distance between leaf veins was greater for the Nipponbare C<sub>3</sub> control plant than for the Yugu1 C<sub>4</sub> plant. The average distances between leaf veins were 259.42 &#x003bc;m and 119.21 &#x003bc;m for Nipponbare (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) and Yugu1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) plants, respectively. After iodine staining, carbohydrates appeared bronze-colored and proteins were yellow. In C<sub>3</sub> plants, photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells that are rich in chloroplasts, resulting in the accumulation of carbohydrates. Bundle sheath cells have poorly developed chloroplasts (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Langdale, 2011</xref>). After iodine staining, the area surrounding the leaf vein was yellow, while the mesophyll cells between leaf veins were brown. The yellow area between leaf veins consisted of bulliform cells with no chloroplasts. In C<sub>4</sub> plants, photosynthetic carbon fixation mainly takes place in bundle sheath cells, in which many carbohydrates accumulate. Thus, leaf veins were bronze-colored, while the mesophyll cells between the leaf veins were yellow (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E,F</xref>). Iodine staining reflected the accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves and enabled analyses of tissue structure changes due to mutations.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Leaves stained with I<sub>2</sub>-KI. <bold>(A)</bold> Decreased carbohydrate abundance and normal vein arrangement (<italic>t62</italic>); <bold>(B)</bold> decreased carbohydrate abundance and abnormal vein arrangement (<italic>t95</italic>); <bold>(C)</bold> increased carbohydrate abundance (<italic>t66</italic>); <bold>(D)</bold> unevenly stained (<italic>t74</italic>); <bold>(E)</bold> rice (C<sub>3</sub> control plant); and <bold>(F)</bold> wild-type Yugu1.

We detected 34 Type-A mutants, which had relatively low sugar levels, resulting in an increase in the yellow-stained areas around leaf veins. Additionally, their leaf veins could be clearly distinguished (e.g., <italic>t62</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Type B included six mutants with relatively low sugar levels and an increase in the yellow-stained areas around leaf veins; however, some leaf veins could not be clearly distinguished (e.g., <italic>t95</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We identified nine Type-C mutants, with increased sugar levels that led to red-stained areas. These mutants also had irregularly arrayed leaf veins (e.g., <italic>t66</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Three mutants were categorized as Type D because of the observed uneven distribution of sugars, with increased and decreased sugar levels surrounding leaf veins (e.g., <italic>t49</italic>, <italic>t50</italic>, and <italic>t74</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Thus, although almost all striped mutants exhibited abnormal sugar accumulation and irregular leaf vein arrangements, we did not detect any mutants with severely defective leaf vein development. This result might be associated with chloroplast development in bundle sheath cells and the inhibition of part of the sugar synthesis and transportation mechanism of a photosynthetic pathway.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Classification of I<sub>2</sub>-KI&#x02013;stained mutants based on the change of accumulation of carbohydrates revealed by color and veins variations.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Types</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mutant numbers</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total number</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t6, t10, t14, t17, t18, t20, t23, t26, t27, t28, t39, t40, t41, t43, t45, t48, t53, t54, t56, t62, t63, t64, t65, t68, t69, t71, t72, t75, t76, t78, t81, t92, t93, t115</italic></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.4%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t11, t46, t47, t95, t104, t106</italic></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.5%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t22, t42, t44, t66, t67, t87, t91, t105, t114</italic></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.3%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>t49, t50, t74</italic></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.8%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Resin Sections</title><p>According to previously published results (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Sage et al., 2014</xref>), C<sub>4</sub> Kranz anatomy possesses enlarged bundle sheath cells compared with C<sub>3</sub> species.

Mature vascular bundles were surrounded by a layer of large circular or oval bundle sheath cells and an outer layer of spindly mesophyll cells.

In the <italic>t6</italic> mutant, vascular tissue that did not develop into a Kranz structure existed between normally developed Kranz structures. This vascular tissue was surrounded by chloroplast-containing bundle sheath cells that were abnormally small and were not associated with tightly arrayed mesophyll cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Meanwhile in the <italic>t11</italic> mutant, the vascular bundles were not surrounded by enlarged bundle sheath cells full of chloroplasts. Additionally, mesophyll cells were circular and similarly sized, and some individual vascular tissues were underdeveloped (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The <italic>t14</italic> and <italic>t18</italic> mutants had apparently differentiated bundle sheath and mesophyll cells with both distinct chloroplast distribution and cell size, but the cells were obviously smaller than those of the wild-type leaves. These mutants also had a relatively thin leaf cross section and closely linked adjacent Kranz structures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,E</xref>). The <italic>t49</italic> mutant produced mesophyll cells that were bigger than bundle sheath cells, and the cells lacking chloroplasts were also bigger than normal.

Furthermore, <italic>t22</italic>, <italic>t42</italic>, <italic>t71</italic>, and <italic>t74</italic> mutants produced abnormal Kranz structures that lacked bundle sheath cells surrounding vascular bundles. Additionally, no chloroplasts were detected (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F,G,J,K</xref>). The cross section of the <italic>t68</italic> mutant leaf revealed a disordered cell arrangement, with circular or oval mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). The <italic>t81</italic> mutant mesophyll cells contained an increased abundance of chloroplasts, while some photosynthetic cells (bundle sheath and mesophyll cells) at the adaxial side of the Kranz structure lacked chloroplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>t50</italic> and <italic>t62</italic> mutants developed small, but otherwise normal, Kranz structures.

In contrast, all of the Kranz structure cells were smaller than normal in the <italic>t62</italic> mutant. The bundle sheath and mesophyll cells of the <italic>t91</italic> mutant differentiated and developed normally, with an orderly arrayed Kranz structure. However, the leaf cross section indicated the parenchymal cells at the adaxial side were larger than normal, resulting in thicker leaves.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Genetic Analysis of Kranz Anatomy in the Grasses</title><p>The identification of mutants in which key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have been disrupted represents a reliable and efficient method for elucidating the molecular basis for these traits. <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rizal et al. (2015)</xref> identified two sorghum (C<sub>4</sub> plant) mutants with relatively low leaf vein densities. A further analysis confirmed that the brassinolide synthesis pathway was blocked, implying this pathway may induce an increase in leaf vein density (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rizal et al., 2015</xref>). Comparative genomics and bioinformatics investigations led researchers to identify many transcription factors, <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, and differentially expressed enzyme-coding genes possibly related to the C<sub>4</sub> pathway based on transcriptome sequencing data. Several transcription factors have been identified, including SCR, SCL23, and SHR, which may regulate both root endodermal cell fate and leaf bundle sheath determination (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the genetic network controlling root endodermal cell fate may be wired very similarly to the leaf bundle sheath developmental program. Although some insight has been gained from the genetic analysis of Kranz anatomy in the grasses, much remains to be discovered. Here we show through the characterization of EMS induced mutations of <italic>S. italica</italic>, that forward genetic screens offer an attractive path to understanding Kranz anatomy.</p><p>In this study, we identified several mutants with disorderly arrayed leaf veins and undeveloped or abnormally developed bundle sheath cells. For example, the <italic>t22</italic>, <italic>t42</italic>, <italic>t71</italic>, and <italic>t74</italic> mutants lacked large, chloroplast-filled, and sheath-shaped cells surrounding vascular bundles (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F,G,J,K</xref>), suggesting the mutated genes were associated with bundle sheath cell development, or related to the disruption of developmental regulators like SHR or SCR. Thus, these mutants may be useful materials for comprehensive analyses of bundle sheath cell development (e.g., gene localization and cloning studies). We observed that, in addition to not forming normal bundle sheath cells, the mutants produced thin and irregularly shaped leaves, as well as abnormally arranged epidermal and mesophyll cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F,G,I</xref>). These complex mutant phenotypes suggest the regulation of the relevant genes or their functional networks is also complex.</p><p>Combining with pictures of mutants&#x02019; phenotype in field (data were not shown), mutant <italic>t22</italic> and <italic>t71</italic> identified in study exhibited similar plant height, panicle type and leaf size compared with wild-type Yugu1. Especially for <italic>t22</italic>, no significant change of carbohydrate accumulation and vein space (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) has been observed between the mutant and wild type, which might illustrate that genetic dissection of <italic>t22</italic> would definitely provide us more detailed information of Kranz structure formation in Setaria. Further studies focused on genetic dissections of Kranz structure mutants through MutMap or transcriptome approaches would be helpful for clarifying how Kranz anatomy came into being in the grasses. Although we really have acquired one or two mutants that maybe special for Kranz structure, most of mutants identified in this trial may not directly relate to the Kranz structure, and exhibited pleiotropic effect (photosynthetic, chloroplast, leaf size) that may be of limited use for dissecting Kranz development. Furthermore, some Kranz structure mutants may be missed during screening processes, despite this is a fast way for mutant identification. Several severe mutants may not have been identified because Kranz anatomy maybe regulated by many genes and possibly redundant, thus making single or limited gene mutations a difficult way to screen mutations with completely terminated Kranz anatomy. Also, mutations that disrupt Kranz anatomy beyond what was found in this study may be seedling lethal, and thus not detected. Former investigations always only focused on vein density and very less leaf tissue cross sections were identified, this may be why these reports have failed to identify Kranz structure mutants. Large scale of cross section analysis may be the only efficient way to identify Kranz structure variations occurred in mutant library.</p></sec><sec><title>Forward Genetics Analyses of Mutations May Accelerate the Molecular Characterization of the Development of Key Structures in C<sub>4</sub> Plants</title><p>Leaf vein density, bundle sheath cell size, and organelle quantity and localization in bundle sheath cells are key structural features that differ between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants. Many researchers are interested in elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the development of these structures. Slewinski have suggested that identifying the positive/negative regulatory factors influencing endoderm development might provide useful information regarding the production of the Kranz structure in C<sub>3</sub> plants (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Slewinski, 2013</xref>). Because of a lack of C<sub>4</sub> mutants with key phenotypes, transcriptomics data have been used to compare whole-genome expression levels between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants and to analyze the leaves or specific tissues of C<sub>4</sub> plants at different developmental stages. By applying genomics and bioinformatics methods, researchers have also identified several transcription factors, <italic>cis</italic>-elements, and differentially expressed genes encoding enzymes possibly related to the C<sub>4</sub> pathway based on transcriptome sequencing data (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Brutnell, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism responsible for the development of the Kranz structure has not been characterized. In this study, relevant EMS mutants were screened, and the genes associated with these mutants will be cloned. Our data would be combined with the existing gene expression profiles for a subsequent analysis to identify genetic factors that mediate the development of the Kranz structure. Additionally, cloning the related target genes for functional verifications may provide new insights into the evolution and development of the Kranz structure in C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Impacts of Chloroplast and Mitochondrial Development Related Genes on Identification of Real C<sub>4</sub> Related Leaf Striped Mutants</title><p>Researchers have studied several leaf striped mutants of rice and maize, and gene localization observations and functional verifications have indicated that striped mutants are usually the result of abnormal chloroplast or mitochondrial development and are severely affected by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and light) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Li P. et al., 2010</xref>). We also revealed that many striped mutant phenotypes are affected by the growth period and tissues. Some striped mutants exhibit diverse gene expression patterns during different developmental periods. In some mutants, the striped phenotype might appear only during the seedling stage. For example, the leaves of the <italic>t22</italic> mutant contain white striped during the seedling stage, but then subsequently appear normal. Conversely, the leaves of some mutants, such as <italic>t53</italic>, exhibit obvious striped phenotypes during later growth stages. Other mutants, including <italic>t41</italic>, <italic>t42</italic>, and <italic>t91</italic>, produce a white striped phenotype at all growth and development stages. Leaf abnormalities may also appear at specific sites. For example, the leaf tip of <italic>t19</italic> and <italic>t72</italic> mutants is yellow, while the rest of the leaf is normal, which is in contrast to <italic>t56</italic> leaves, in which white striped are produced toward the bottom.</p><p>Leaf veins and Kranz structures developed essentially normally in some striped mutants (e.g., <italic>t56</italic>, <italic>t72</italic>, and <italic>t91</italic>). The Kranz structure is a core structural feature of C<sub>4</sub> plants. Identifying mutants with significant Kranz structural changes, but that are otherwise normal, is critical for elucidating the development of this structure. Microscopy techniques are invaluable for this type of research. However, an initial analysis of untreated leaf sections may be advisable. Preparing paraffin or resin sections of specific mutants selected based on the initial universal screen of mutants may decrease the workload and improve efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the emerging model species of Setaria was used for dissecting C<sub>4</sub> Kranz anatomy through forward genetic approaches.
