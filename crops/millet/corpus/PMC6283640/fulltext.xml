Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of crop residue amount (0, 1, 2 and 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), moisture (wet versus dry), type (wheat, barley, canola, chickpea and lupin) and age (fresh or aged for one year) on the interception and subsequent leaching of prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone, and trifluralin from the residue into soil. Bioassays, using cucumber and annual ryegrass as indicator plants, were used to assess herbicide activity/availability in the soil and on the residue. Herbicide interception increased considerably as residue quantity increased from 2 to 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. After simulated rainfall, which washed herbicide into the soil, complete control of ryegrass occurred for trifluralin with 0 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> residue, for prosulfocarb with 0 and 1 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> residue, and for pyroxasulfone with all residue rates. Therefore, with rain or irrigation, pyroxasulfone was the herbicide least affected by high residue loads. Less chemical leached from the crop residue into the soil after rainfall, when prosulfocarb and trifluralin were applied to wet residue compared with dry residue, but the initial moisture condition had no effect on the leaching of pyroxasulfone from residue. If practically possible, farmers should minimise spraying prosulfocarb and trifluralin onto wet crop residue. Barley and wheat residues intercepted more herbicide than an equivalent mass of canola, chickpea or lupin residue, which was largely due to the increased ground cover with cereal residues. The effect of residue age on herbicide interception and leaching was relatively small and variable. Overall, more herbicide reached the soil when sprayed on one-year old residue than new residue, which was largely due to reduced ground cover with aged residue. A strong positive linear relationship existed between ground cover percentage and growth of bioassay species (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.75). This means that there was little difference in the ability of residue to adsorb and retain herbicide between crop residue types and ages, such that farmers can simply use the ground cover of the crop residue to assess interception.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conservation agriculture (CA) is a production system widely adopted around the world, including in Australia. Crop residue retention is one of the pillars of CA, along with zero or minimum mechanical soil disturbance and diverse crop rotations [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The presence of crop residues on the soil surface protects the soil from erosion, conserves soil moisture, and builds up soil organic carbon (SOC) for crop production [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Crop residues on the soil surface also play a role in reducing herbicide efficacy in no-tillage (NT) systems [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] because they can intercept a considerable amount of herbicide at the time of application [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For example metolachlor activity in the soil declined with high amounts of wheat residue [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Even after rainfall, crop residue retained atrazine [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and metolachlor [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Crop residues would be expected to reduce the weed control efficacy of herbicides due to interception by crop residue and consequent reduction in the amount of herbicide reaching the soil. However, Prihar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that plots with maize residue had better weed control, than those without maize residue, irrespective of atrazine application. Also, other research showed that soil covered with residue had better weed control with alachlor than uncovered soil [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but this may be due to the residue smothering the weeds, which compensates for the reduction in herbicide reaching the soil [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, Day [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that smothering of weeds by crop residue may weaken weed seedlings, which contributes to increased herbicide efficacy.</p><p>Several factors affect whether herbicides are intercepted by crop residues, some being herbicide-related (physio-chemical properties), while others are related to the properties of the crop residues. For example, wet residues have lower sorption capacity for herbicides than the soil underneath [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The capacity of a herbicide to volatilise is relatively high for standing straw compared with horizontal straw [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a result, herbicide losses increased when combined with standing, wet residue [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, once the herbicide contacted the soil, the chance of volatilisation decreased due to increased sorption, particularly in soils with more organic matter [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Studies conducted by Lal [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and De-Silva and Cook [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggested that 4&#x02013;6 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of residue is enough to improve rainfall infiltration and reduce soil erosion. Banks and Robinson [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the amount of acetochlor, alachlor, and metolachlor detected in the soil progressively declined as the amount of wheat residue on soil the surface increased from 0 to 6.7 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. However, the percent cover may be more closely related to herbicide interception than the amount of residue especially at low residue levels; whereas, amount of residue may be more important with high residue levels (with 100% ground cover), such as in some NT systems. The conversion of residue amounts into coverage for different crops has not been well researched [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The type and composition of crop residues also influences the interaction with herbicides. Dao [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that the lignin content of plant stubble might be responsible for most of its sorptive capacity while cellulose, the more abundant plant material, has little impact [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, older, partially-decomposed straw appears to adsorb more herbicide than fresh straw [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This may be due to the decomposition of cellulose and other plant elements, thereby exposing the more reactive lignin compounds [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, Grover [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that picloram was not adsorbed on wheat stubble or cellulose but was highly adsorbed on SOM. The physical&#x02013;chemical mechanisms, such as the sorption of herbicides by lignocellulose may reduce the effective solution concentration, thereby curbing bioavailability and biodegradation [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The sorption of chlorimuron and cyanazine increased with the degree of residue decay on hairy vetch (<italic>Vicia villosa</italic> Roth), rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.) and ryegrass (<italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam.) residues [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and was not completely reversible [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Common pre-emergent herbicides currently used in NT systems are prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone and trifluralin [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. They were introduced to control grasses and small-seeded broadleaves in corn, soybean, sunflower, and field pea in Canada [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], United States and Australia [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As stubble retention is a key component of NT systems, it is important to understand the impact of crop residue amount and type on the activity of these herbicides, especially after rainfall. In this study, prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone and trifluralin were sprayed onto crop residues followed by simulated rainfall to test the hypotheses that: 1) increased residue amount will intercept more herbicide, which will leach into the soil after rainfall; 2) initially wet residue will leach less herbicide into the soil than initially dry residue; 3) crop residue type will influence the amount of herbicide leached and 4) older residue will leach less herbicide than fresh new residue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of simulated rainfall on leaching of prosulfocarb (Boxer, 800 g ai L<sup>-1</sup> (S-benzyl dipropyl(thiocarbamate)), Syngenta Crop Protection AG, Postfach, Switzerland), pyroxasulfone (Sakura, 850 g ai kg<sup>-1</sup>, (5-(difluoromethoxy)-1-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl) pyrazol-4-ylmethyl 4,5-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl sulfone), Bayer Cropscience Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia) and trifluralin (Treflan, 480 g ai L<sup>-1</sup>, Dow AgroSciences Canada Inc. A Subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company, Canada) from crop residues into the soil. The amount of herbicide remaining on the crop residue or in the soil was determined by bioassay.

The soil was a sandy loam (74% sand, 12% silt, 14% clay), with pH (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) of 4.4, 2.96 cmol(+)kg<sup>-1</sup> CEC, exchangeable cations of 2.75 Ca, 0.14 K, 0.45 Mg, 0.07 Na cmol(+)kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and 1.8% organic carbon [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Four Petri dishes, each containing 50 g of dry soil, were placed onto plastic trays, which were then covered with the crop residue treatment and sprayed with one of three herbicides, except for an unsprayed control. This methods form the basis of all three experiments. The rates of herbicide were 2000 g a.i. ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of prosulfocarb, 102 g a.i. ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> pyroxasulfone and 960 g a.i. ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> trifluralin, as per the recommended field rates [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. After spraying, 20 mm of simulated rainfall at 10 mm hr<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> was applied, except for the control (nil rainfall) (rainfall simulation details provided in a subsequent section). The crop residues were then air-dried for few hours and ground into small particles using mechanical plant material grinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.retsch.com/">www.retsch.com</ext-link>). To minimise sample contamination, the grinder was thoroughly cleaned after each experimental unit with a vacuum and then air compressor to blow air through the grinder. The particle size of the ground residue was determined by sieving 50 g of unsprayed material, with most residues ranging from 2 to 4 mm. The ground residue was placed in plastic bags and stored, along with the Petri dishes of soil, for few days at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until being used in a bioassay to determine bioavailability.

This suggests that, of the three herbicides, pyroxasulfone should be considered by applicators as a pre-emergent herbicide when the amount of residue on the soil surface exceeds about 2 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, as rainfall can easily wash the herbicide into the soil, but for residue amounts less than 2 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, prosulfocarb may also be effective. Trifluralin should be considered when it can be incorporated into the soil either by rainfall immediately after application or with seeding machinery. Reduced amounts of herbicide reaching the soil are due to interception by crop residue [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208274.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Banks and Robinson [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that increased levels of wheat residue on the soil surface decreased the amount of acetochlor, alachlor and metolachlor in the soil, which reduced weed control and that 13 mm of subsequent irrigation washed 15&#x02013;20% of the original herbicide application into the soil. Also, the residue retained more metolachlor than acetochlor or alachlor. Other studies have shown that plant residues do not significantly reduce weed control efficacy. For example, Crutchfield, Wicks [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that wheat straw levels up to 6.8 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> did not reduce weed control efficacy of metolachlor applied at 1.5 times the recommended rate, as the straw itself provided some measure of weed control and compensated for less herbicide reaching the soil.</p><p>In our study, the physical effect of crop residues on weed suppression could not be tested in the bioassay. In other research, the efficacy of a mixture of alachlor and atrazine in controlling weeds was not affected by surface mulching when recommended rates of herbicide were used [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, Erbach and Lovely [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that 6.2 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of non-chopped corn stems did not reduce the effectiveness of weed control when using recommended rates of atrazine or alachlor, but did when lower herbicide rates were used. Presumably, chopping the straw would increase the proportion of ground covered by the residue, which would reduce weed control efficacy. Therefore, a key factor when using herbicides with high levels of crop residue is to ensure that sufficiently high rates of the chemical are used along with high carrier/spray volumes, as shown by Borger, Riethmuller [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These authors found that increasing the carrier volume from 30 to 150 L ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> improved the average control of ryegrass by trifluralin and pyroxasulfone from 53 to 78%. Further research should be conducted to assess optimal rates for the different pre-emergent herbicides to achieve good weed control at different crop residue levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Experiment 2 &#x02013;Residue moisture</title><p>The presence of residue increased shoot length compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s002">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s008">S2 Text</xref>). The differences in herbicide leaching between wet and dry residue were not always clear-cut. Virtually no ryegrass germinated with any of the herbicides in the residue bioassay, indicating that phytotoxic levels remained on the residue even after rainfall. The cucumber data showed that rainfall leached some herbicide from the residue relative to the treated control (with no rainfall applied) and that less herbicide leached with initially wet than dry residue, although no significant differences were evident for pyroxasulfone. The same trend occurred for the soil bioassays, where less herbicide tended to reach the soil with wet than dry residue, although again no significant differences were evident for pyroxasulfone. These results indicate that in an NT system, with crop residue covering the soil, more prosulfocarb and trifluralin reaches the soil after rainfall when the chemicals are sprayed onto dry rather than wet residue. The moisture status of the residue has little effect on the amount of pyroxasulfone that reaches the soil after subsequent rainfall. From a practical point of view and to minimise the loss of intercepted herbicides, NT farmers should avoid spraying prosulfocarb and trifluralin onto wet crop residue otherwise they may need to increase the herbicide application rate to compensate for losses when sprayed onto wet residues. Heavy dew that wet the residue, may also have a similar effect in reducing the efficacy of these herbicides, if the residue was still wet when sprayed.

Overall, barley and wheat residues produced the longest cucumber shoot lengths and lupin the shortest, indicating highest concentrations of &#x02018;bioavailable&#x02019; prosulfocarb were retained in lupin residue. Martin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported that corn residue (6&#x02013;8.9 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) retained 50% and 30% of tested herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine and propachlor) after applying 10 mm and 35 mm of water, respectively. Dang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] also reported that sugarcane residue (5 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) retained 20% of sprayed herbicides (atrazine, ametryn, diuron, and hexazinone) after 30 mm of rainfall. This indicates that different amounts of sprayed herbicides can be retained by different crop residues. In this study, the canola and chickpea results were variable. In the absence of rainfall, aged wheat and chickpea residue had greater shoot length than the equivalent new residue, and the reverse occurred with canola. Age of material had little effect on prosulfocarb activity in barley and lupin residue. Rainfall increased cucumber growth the most with chickpea residue, for both aged and new material, but only had a small effect on cucumber shoot length with barley residue and an intermediate with wheat and canola residues. Rainfall increased shoot length in new lupin residue but had little effect on aged lupin residue.</p><p>For pyroxasulfone remaining in the residue, cucumber shoot length followed a similar pattern to prosulfocarb where barley had the greatest shoot length in most instances, particularly with new residue, followed by wheat, canola and chickpea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s003">S3 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s009">S3 Text</xref>). Likewise, lupin had the shortest shoots. The differences between aged and new residue were relatively small, although aged residue tended to have longer shoots, except for barley, indicating less herbicide availability in the residue. This was particularly in the case for wheat and chickpea, with and without rainfall, and for lupin with no rainfall. Rainfall generally increased shoot length and produced similar results to prosulfocarb, where it had the greatest effect on chickpea residue, a smaller effect on barley residue and little effect on aged lupin residue.</p><p>As for the other two herbicides, trifluralin generally had the greatest or equal shoot length with barley residue and smallest with lupin residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s003">S3 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s009">S3 Text</xref>). With no rainfall, cucumber in aged chickpea residue had longer shoots than in new residue, and the reverse occurred with canola. Age had little effect on the other crop residue types. Rainfall generally increased shoot length, including aged lupin residue. Rainfall also had little effect on cucumber growth in canola residue.</p><p>In summary, herbicide remaining on the residue was influenced most by crop residue type. In general, barley residue had the greatest or equal cucumber shoot length (as a percentage of the equivalent untreated residue) followed by wheat, canola, chickpea and lupin residues. Although, the shoot length of bioassay species grown in wheat, canola and chickpea residue was variable and influenced slightly more by herbicide, crop residue age and rainfall. This indicates that the barley residue had the least bioavailable herbicide and lupin residue the most. The effect of residue age was smaller than residue type. Older residue tended to have greater shoot length than new residue, although the effect of age was minimal with barley and lupin residue and the reverse was true for canola residue, except for pyroxasulfone. Rainfall generally increased shoot length of cucumber, indicating that some herbicide was washed off the residue into the soil below. The rainfall effect was greatest with chickpea residue and least for barley residue. Rainfall did not affect aged lupin residue, except with trifluralin.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Herbicide in the soil</title><p>There were interactions between residue type, age and rainfall, with the responses greater for ryegrass than cucumber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s003">S3 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s009">S3 Text</xref>).

Pyroxasulfone killed all the ryegrass in the soil after rainfall for all residue types and ages and, unlike prosulfocarb, rainfall effectiveness did not differ between barley and wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s003">S3 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208274.s009">S3 Text</xref>).

This suggests that more herbicide reached the soil under chickpea and lupin residues and was mainly a function of ground cover. A linear regression of ground cover percentage against cucumber shoot length in the soil (% of untreated control) for all data (across all herbicides, residue types and ages) without simulated rainfall showed a significant, but weak, relationship with only 36% of the variance accounted for. However, this increased to 75% of the variance accounted for when the regression included herbicide as a factor i.e. separate linear regressions for each herbicide (<xref rid="pone.0208274.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Further linear regression analysis, on individual herbicides, compared simulated rainfall with the nil rainfall control. As expected, the regression line for rainfall was lower than that of nil rainfall, because the plants were smaller due to more herbicide washing off the residue into the soil (<xref ref-type="fig"

significantly), with the slope of the regression decreasing from 0.51 in the absence of rainfall to 0.27 following rainfall (<xref rid="pone.0208274.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This demonstrates the effectiveness of rainfall to reduce the impact of residue and improve the efficacy of pyroxasulfone, especially in the presence of thick crop residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Overall, residue age only had a small effect on the amount of herbicide reaching the soil, with slightly more herbicide reaching the soil under aged than new residue.</p><p>In the absence of rainfall this would most likely be related to ground cover, with aged residue having lower ground cover percentage than new residue, with the differences more evident for canola, chickpea and lupin residues. The effect of lignin concentration (between residue types and ages) on the amount of herbicide washing off the residue was difficult to determine, as lignin was confounded with ground cover percentage. This analysis suggests that farmers simply need to assess residue ground cover, irrespective of its type, in order to assess the impact of residue on herbicide efficacy in the absence of rainfall or irrigation.</p><p>Rainfall after herbicide application improved the efficacy by leaching some intercepted herbicide into the soil beneath crop residues, which in turn better increased its availability and potential for weed control. In the absence of simulated rainfall, the less herbicide reached the soil with increasing residue amount, with a marked increase in shoot length from 2 to 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Nonetheless, 100% ryegrass control was achieved with pyroxasulfone after rainfall, even at 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> residue. The results showed that, with rainfall or irrigation, pyroxasulfone can still be effective as a pre-emergent herbicide when the amount of flat residue on the soil surface exceeds 2 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> and prosulfocarb when the amount of flat residue on the soil surface is less than 2 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. In a situation with crop residue covering the soil, more prosulfocarb and trifluralin reached the soil after rainfall when the chemicals were sprayed onto initially dry compared with wet wheat residue. In contrast, the moisture status of the residue at the time of herbicide application had little effect on the amount of pyroxasulfone that reached the soil after subsequent rainfall. If possible, farmers should avoid spraying prosulfocarb and trifluralin into wet crop residue, otherwise they may need to increase the herbicide rate to compensate for losses when sprayed onto wet residues. Aslam et al. [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] showed that under a light and frequent rainfall regime, S-metolachlor dissipation in crop residues was quicker than a heavy and infrequent rain regime. This was due to wetter surface conditions, where crop residue decomposition was also faster. Microbial decomposition of crop residues is highly affected by water dynamics (rainfall) and temperature at the soil&#x02013;residue interface [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Unger [<xref rid="pone.0208274.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that crop residues that are often wet have low sorption capacity for pesticides and are less aerodynamically stable than the soil underneath. Aged canola, chickpea and lupin residue generally had lower ground cover than new residue, while the differences were relatively small for aged and new cereals residues.</p><p>Crop residue type had a greater effect on herbicide interception than age of residue. With 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of crop residue, the least herbicide reached the soil with barley residue followed by wheat with canola residue intermediate but variable, and chickpea and lupin residues the most. There was a strong positive linear relationship between ground cover percentage and growth of the bioassay species (i.e. less herbicide reached the soil with more ground cover). Lupin stubble had the least ground cover, followed by chickpea, canola and the cereals, which had &#x0003e; 90% ground cover at 4 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> of residue. The relative importance of percent ground cover compared with lignin concentration on herbicide leaching from residue is of interest, however, it could not be determined in this research as the two were confounded. Also, there was no consistent pattern between amount of herbicide leached and lignin concentration, possibly because of the relatively small differences in lignin concentration between residue types and ages.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data from residue and soil used in the Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g002">2</xref> (Experiment1).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data from residue and soil used in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g003">Fig 3</xref> (Experiment2).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Raw data from residue and soil used in the Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g009">9</xref> (Experiment3).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Original figure of Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g002">2</xref> cited in the text (Experiment1).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s005"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Original figure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g003">Fig 3</xref> cited in the text (Experiment2).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s006"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Original figures of Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208274.g009">9</xref> cited in the text (Experiment3).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s007"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Output of the analyses of data from Experiment1.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s008"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Output of the analyses of data from Experiment2.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208274.s009"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Output of the analyses of data from Experiment3.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208274.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0208274.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Verhulst</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Govaerts</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Verachtert</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Castellanos-Navarrete</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mezzalama</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wall</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
