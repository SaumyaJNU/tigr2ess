<italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> L is one of the indigenous fruit tree species that traditionally contributes to food security and ecosystem stability in sub-Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that the indigenous people of Eastern Uganda have used <italic>T. indica</italic> for generations and developed practices that promote its conservation and therefore we expected that they possess an elaborate indigenous knowledge (IK) system and that most of them have planted the species. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of IK, attitudes and practices on the use and conservation of <italic>T. indica</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cross sectional survey was conducted in two districts purposively selected from the <italic>T. indica</italic> natural range. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and observation were used to collect data. Data was processed using qualitative analytical methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
<italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> was highly valued by the majority of the population. <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> was used for food, medicinal, cultural, social, environmental amelioration and income generation purposes. The population possessed a high level of IK about <italic>T. indica</italic> evidenced by 18 categories of uses and multiple modes of use. Fruit pulp was the most commonly used tamarind product. Relative frequency of citation of the different uses provides insight into usage levels and IK possessed. The communities&#x02019; food and medicinal uses concurred with scientific reports of health benefits of consuming <italic>T. indica</italic>. Approximately half of respondents had <italic>T. indica</italic> on their compounds or homegardens (53%). Fifty two percent of the tamarind population was self-propagated, 45% were planted while the propagation history for the remaining 3% was not known. Constraints towards planting <italic>T. indica</italic> included limited land, long maturation period and low monetary value. Fifty three percent of those who were growing <italic>T. indica</italic> did not carry out any silvicultural practices. The majority of <italic>T. indica</italic> encountered (87%) was intercropped with other crops or trees. Several beliefs and taboos regarding <italic>T. indica</italic> persist.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>
<italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> has a high use value in the study area evidenced by multiple uses. Indigenous knowledge and uses concurred with scientifically proven nutritional and medicinal attributes of <italic>T. indica</italic> in literature which is significant given current trends towards affordable functional foods. The high level of IK has not translated into high rates of planting <italic>T. indica</italic>. There is need to encourage value-addition so as to maximize <italic>T. indica</italic> benefits and enhance conservation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> L</kwd><kwd>Indigenous knowledge</kwd><kwd>Conservation</kwd><kwd>Uganda</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Kyambogo University</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>RISE-AFNNET of the Carnegie Corporation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Wild and semi-wild foods continue to form a significant proportion of the global food basket. Although a variety of social and ecological drivers are acting to reduce the use of wild and semi-wild foods, their importance may be set to grow as pressures on agricultural productivity increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Local communities possess key knowledge and skills pertinent to the conservation of the ecosystems where they live [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As local people and communities encounter cultural changes there is risk that the knowledge on plant resource use could be lost unless such knowledge is documented and conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such documentation contributes to providing local solutions or alternatives and instilling pride among rural communities about their traditional values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Tamarind (<italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> L: Leguminosae), is an indigenous fruit tree of the tropics reported to be underutilised worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Tamarind grows into a large evergreen tree, 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;m tall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> possesses great potential to address various nutritional, health, socioeconomic and environmental constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In Uganda it is indigenous and the study areas of Butaleja and Tororo districts in Eastern Uganda form part of its natural range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While the importance of indigenous knowledge (IK) for conservation of ecosystems is widely recognized, documentation about its role in the conservation of <italic>T. indica</italic> in Uganda is very scanty. <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> has traditionally served to supplement the communities&#x02019; food needs especially during times of scarcity. Although <italic>T. indica</italic> has been used in the study areas since time immemorial, documentation about its use and conservation is very scanty. According to Gadgil et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] knowledge, attitudes and practices can be important indicators for conservation. Understanding the types and extent of IK possessed by the communities in the study area regarding <italic>T. indica</italic> may be vital in guiding decisions on how the resource can be conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Documenting the knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with <italic>T. indica</italic> production and conservation was therefore deemed pertinent given its potential to address the constraints faced by the local communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We hypothesized that the indigenous people of Eastern Uganda have used <italic>T. indica</italic> for generations and developed practices that promote its conservation and therefore we expected that they possess an elaborate IK system and that most of them have planted the species. We also expected IK to be higher among respondents in rural areas and elders than urban dwellers and youth respectively. The study aimed at assessing the influence of IK, attitudes and practices on the use and conservation of <italic>T. indica</italic>. The specific objectives were 1) to identify knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with <italic>T. indica</italic> production, use and conservation in Tororo and Butaleja districts. 2) To assess how knowledge, attitudes and practices have influenced <italic>T. indica</italic> conservation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p>The area is located in eastern Uganda and lies between Longitude 33&#x000b0;E and 34&#x000b0;E and Latitudes 0&#x000b0;N and 1&#x000b0;N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

</p><p>Responses from focus group discussions revealed that young people were not as knowledgeable as the elders concerning tamarind&#x02019;s uses. Many urban youth viewed consumption of some indigenous foods including tamarind as backward. Youth in rural areas were more interested in earning an income from tamarind products. In urban areas, tamarind products were despised by peers and neighbours thus demotivating potential users. Focus group discussions also revealed that trees at construction sites, including <italic>T. indica</italic>, were felled to create space for buildings and provide building materials thus contributing to reduction of the tamarind population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Tamarind locations</title><p>

<italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> was reported as one of the species in sacred groves surrounding traditional shrines in the study area. Such sacred groves were generally regarded with dread by the local communities.

Unlike other tree seedlings that are usually destroyed before or during ploughing, <italic>T. indica</italic> seedlings were spared while saplings were pruned to enable easy maneuvering of the ox-plough commonly used in the area. The common practice was to spare <italic>T. indica</italic> seedlings found growing in convenient locations such as compounds, home gardens or in public areas such as school or church compounds and along roads and paths. Respondents revealed that cropland was the least favoured location for planting <italic>T. indica</italic> because it competed for limited space with foodcrops.

</p><p>The majority of <italic>T. indica</italic> observed (92%) appeared healthy (without disease or pest infestations). Incidences of damages on the trees were minimal (5.0%). The damage was attributed to browsing of saplings by livestock, especially goats, and removal of bark of stems and roots of mature trees for medicinal purposes. Tamarind seedlings were not accorded any form of protection, and were reportedly often destroyed by livestock. Approximately half of the respondents (53%) did not add fertilizer or carry out any other silvicultural practices on tamarinds. Thirty seven percent reported pruning <italic>T. indica</italic> so as to increase fruiting and improve manageability while 10% coppiced the trees to acquire fodder and firewood and enable regeneration and better fruiting of older trees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Crops and trees grown with <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic></title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Harvesting, processing and consumption of <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic></title><p>In the study areas <italic>T. indica</italic> fruits ripen during the dry season when food generally and fresh fruit and vegetables in particular are in short supply thus providing a supplementary source of nutrients. Furthermore <italic>T. indica</italic> is easily accessible to all community members. Harvesting was mostly done by young men and children. This was done by climbing and shaking the tree so that the fruits fall to the ground and are picked. Alternatively a long stick was used to remove the fruits. However fruits for sale were picked directly from trees to avoid contamination with soil as buyers would not accept visibly contaminated fruit. Alternatively, the higher branches were accessed using a ladder. The bark was most often accessed from the ground. Small amounts of tamarind fruit for home consumption were harvested from trees on communal land, one&#x02019;s own land or after seeking the owner&#x02019;s permission. Large amounts for sale had to be purchased from tree owners, collected from one&#x02019;s own trees or from communal land.</p><p>Processing of tamarind was mostly done by women and children since it is women who usually prepare family meals. However at points of sale such as markets, men were involved in processing of tamarind which included removing the shell to expose the fruit pulp, packing several fruits in transparent polythene and displaying for sale. In homes, the fruits were dehusked and soaked in water to soften. Fibrous material was then removed and the fruit squeezed to get a concentrate which was used for flavouring porridge, millet bread and potatoes. Alternatively the concentrate was diluted to make a cool refreshing beverage popular with all age groups. Sugar or honey was often added to enhance taste. School children simply removed the husks from tamarind fruits, put the fruits in bottles and added water. The bottle was then shaken to make a type of &#x02018;tamarindade&#x02019; which was enjoyed immensely. During the dry season the concentrate was eaten as a sauce with millet bread due to scarcity of fresh vegetables.</p><p>Traditionally, tamarind beverage was recommended for convalescents and expectant mothers. Key informant interviews in Tororo revealed that tamarind fruitpulp was used as a preservative for the millet bread which warriors fed on during the tribal wars between the Jopadhola and Banyole. Tamarind fruit beverage was also commonly given to rejuvenate those returning from war.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Beliefs, taboos and superstitions associated with <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic></title><p>Beliefs, taboos and superstitions were observed to be an intrinsic part of the IK of the communities in the study areas. A common belief formerly prevalent in both districts was that whoever planted <italic>T. indica</italic> would die before tasting its fruit. In the words of one respondent: &#x02018;<italic>Planting a tamarind tree is pointless since one cannot live long enough to eat its fruit. You can only plant for your children and grandchildren.</italic>&#x02019; However during focus group discussions majority of respondents revealed that such a belief could not deter them from planting <italic>T. indica</italic> but attributed their not planting to lack of adequate land for growing both <italic>T. indica</italic> and other crops. The words of one 80-year old widow were insightful: &#x02018;<italic>My husband planted a tamarind seedling on our compound hoping to only benefit from its shade. However he ate of its fruit for more than 5 years before his death. It has the sweetest fruit of all the three tamarind trees on our land. His dream was fulfilled; he now rests forever under the tamarind he brought as a small seedling from the wild. As for me, his children and grandchildren, we continue to enjoy its fruit</italic>&#x02019;. Traditionally, the local inhabitants bury their dead on the compound or in the homestead. In this way the memory of their dead relatives is honoured and preserved as the graves are never far away from the living. It was observed that most of the <italic>T. indica</italic> on compounds and abandoned compounds were in the vicinity of graves. This probably points to the close relationship between culture and <italic>T. indica</italic> in these communities.</p><p>This close relationship was illustrated dramatically in that two-thirds of all the large tamarind trees were observed to have stems that were either charred or had holes near their bases. Interviews revealed that during funerals, meals were prepared under tamarind trees since they are usually free from parasites. Being hardy, <italic>T. indica</italic> often survived the abuse leaving a charred or holed stem as evidence of past funeral activities.</p><p>A cultural practice reported among the Jopadhola ethnic group was that once a girl who has experienced menstrual period climbed a tamarind tree, the fruits of such a tree became sour. Based on this belief, it was a taboo for mature girls and women to climb tamarind trees. No specific taboos concerning harvesting <italic>T. indica</italic> were reported in Butaleja district except for <italic>T. indica</italic> growing around sacred groves and shrines being shunned by the public.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trade in <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> products</title><p>Respondents reported fruit and whole trees as the most commonly sold tamarind products. Trees were mainly sold to operators of limestone kilns and brick makers. Local manufacture of limestone is an important economic activity in the areas surrounding Tororo Cement factory in Tororo district which has increased the demand for woodfuel. Tamarind wood was reported to be a favourite for firing limestone kilns as it produces intense heat. Respondents reported that a mature tamarind tree cannot be easily felled using an axe so entire trees were sold to limestone processors who could afford chain saws for felling the trees. In the words of one respondent: &#x02018;<italic>Only the rich can afford to fell a tamarind tree so we sell at a giveaway price. Furthermore, a big tamarind tree often requires at least two chains and we have witnessed chainsaws break in the process of cutting</italic>&#x02019;. The extremely hard tamarind wood probably accounts for the existence of very old trees estimated to be over 100&#x000a0;years old.</p><p>Respondents in Tororo district reported selling tamarind fruit with its shells still intact for the equivalent of half a United States dollar for smaller heaps (&#x02264;1&#x000a0;kg) and up to one dollar for a basinful (3&#x02013;8&#x000a0;kg). Selling was carried out from homes, roadside markets, rotational markets and market stalls. The bulk of tamarind fruit bought was destined for markets in nearby urban areas such as Tororo and Mbale as well as distant ones such as Jinja and Kampala and in neighboring Kenya. Tamarind fruit was sold by both men and women. Respondents in Butaleja district did not report selling any tamarind product.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The majority of respondents viewed <italic>T. indica</italic> as a valuable resource. This is in agreement with Bourou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] who observe that indigenous fruit tree species such as tamarind traditionally act to build resilience into the Sub-Saharan Africa&#x02019;s farming system in terms of food security, income generation and ecosystem stability. The frequency of citation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) was a reflection of the proportion of the population that uses <italic>T. indica</italic> products for the stated purposes as well as being an indirect measure of the level of IK. High frequency of citation was therefore indicative of the high use value of <italic>T. indica.</italic> This is in agreement with Havinga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] who report that <italic>T. indica</italic> is highly valued in West Africa where it is always spared during clearing of land for crop farming. Tamarind fruit beverage had the highest percent citation (100%) indicating it was consumed by all respondents. Ethnomedicinal uses for humans and ethnoveterinary uses had the lowest percent citations (13 and 15% respectively) probably because such knowledge is possessed by only a few people mostly elders, herbalists and traditional healers. Noss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] argue that when people appreciate the value of biodiversity, they will be more likely to think about conservation in their day-to-day activities such as how to use land and other natural resources. The selective sparing of <italic>T. indica</italic> seedlings points to the high value attached to it compared to other tree species in the study area. On the other hand focus group discussions revealed that <italic>T. indica</italic> was often felled to create space for buildings and provide building materials. This is a reflection of competing landuses especially in urban areas. Urbanization has therefore indirectly contributed to reduction of the <italic>T. indica</italic> population.</p><p>The 18 uses reported by respondents is evidence of the intricate IK possessed by the community about <italic>T. indica</italic>. Although the local communities lack documented or scientifically proven evidence about <italic>T. indica</italic>&#x02019;s nutritional or health benefits, their food and medicinal uses are in agreement with scientific evidence for instance regarding its antioxidant attributes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The relevance of IK is further illustrated by the traditional practice of feeding tamarind fruit pulp to pregnant women and warriors to boost health and recovery. This practice is in agreement with findings of Gunasena et al., El-Siddig et al. and De Caluw&#x000e9; et al. who report <italic>T. indica</italic> as rich in calcium, phosphorus, potassium and containing significant amounts of iron as well as sodium, copper, zinc and nickel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Tamarind pulp and seed can be used as alternative sources of nutrients to alleviate malnutrition and improve nutritional status in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Both the pulp and seed extracts are reported to be rich in several phytonutrients that act as powerful dietary antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. According to De Caluw&#x000e9; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the leaves are a fair source of vitamin C and &#x003b2;-carotene and mineral content is high, particularly P, K, Ca and Mg. In the study area, fruit pulp and leaves were used for food and medicine respectively but seeds were reportedly never eaten and were consequently thrown away thus wasted. In spite of having an intricate IK system, it has not significantly affected processing of <italic>T. indica</italic> as no value-added products were encountered and <italic>T. indica</italic> remains underutilized.</p><p>Results from focus group discussions and interviews reveal that the views held by local people (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) are similar to the findings of various scholars who describe <italic>T. indica</italic> as a sustainable resource with positive environmental benefits, having many uses which is available during the dry season when other food supplies are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> provides perennial cover thus protecting the soil and aiding in the storage and recycling of plant nutrients and organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The local people&#x02019;s observations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) are in agreement with documented descriptions of <italic>T. indica</italic> as having strong roots and branches, wind resistant, highly resistant to disease attacks and able to grow successfully under a variety of soil and agroclimatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several authors including El-Siddig et al., De Caluw&#x000e9; et al. and Havinga et al.

Used to cleanse a new house in India by marrying <italic>T. indica</italic> to a mango tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>The population possessed a vast amount of IK about <italic>T. indica</italic> uses (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This is in agreement with Shapi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] who point out that local communities possess elaborate IK systems which are key for the conservation of indigenous tree species. However it was observed during focus group discussions that even within a single community with the same language and culture there was variation of knowledge about <italic>T. indica</italic> between the youth and the older generation. Responses during focus group discussions indicate that IK systems surrounding <italic>T. indica</italic> may be in danger of disappearing with the older generation as much of this IK is possessed by the older generation. While majority of urban youth despised consumption of tamarind, rural youth were more interested in earning an income from selling <italic>T. indica</italic> products. However school age children in both rural and urban areas appreciated tamarind fruit. Well-packaged conservation messages targeting school going children are more likely to be embraced by both the children and their parents thus boosting planting of <italic>T. indica</italic>.</p><p>Tamarind wood was reported to be a favourite for firing locally made kilns for small-scale processing of limestone because of the intense heat it produces. This can be attributed to its high calorific value which is estimated at &#x02248;5000 cal per kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Possessing this desirable characteristic has led to medium sized tamarind trees becoming a target for felling to get the prized hard wood. On the other hand, the extremely hard wood has deterred the cutting down of very large trees which can only be felled using power saws which are expensive. The survival of very old trees estimated to be over a century old is advantageous as it contributes directly to the survival of <italic>T. indica</italic> populations in the area.</p><p>Observation of the tamarind niche revealed that farmers plant or preserve <italic>T. indica</italic> with other tree species. These findings are in agreement with the views of Nyadoi, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] who proposes conservation of <italic>T. indica</italic> with other ecologically compatible-economically important tree species as a strategy for ensuring sustainable raw material supply for developing tree products industry. Eighty seven percent of <italic>T. indica</italic> encountered in quadrats grew among a variety of crops and other tree species. Research therefore needs to be done to determine the benefits and disadvantages of growing <italic>T. indica</italic> with other crops or trees so as to advise local people appropriately.</p><p>The presence of <italic>T. indica</italic> in sacred groves points to the spiritual significance attributed to the species among sections of the communities studied. Although such aspects of the IK cannot be measured or proved using known scientific methods, they have contributed significantly to conservation of indigenous tree species including <italic>T. indica. Tamarindus indica</italic> is considered a sacred tree in some parts of the world such as India and West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The limited accessibility of sacred groves is advantageous for preservation of <italic>T. indica</italic> in situ since trees therein are not usually cut down. These findings concur with Banana et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Gombya-Ssembajwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] who observe that in Uganda, traditions, customs, beliefs and cultural rights play an important role in ecosystem conservation and biodiversity. The observation that most of the <italic>T. indica</italic> on homesteads and abandoned compounds was in the vicinity of graves also points to the close relationship between culture and <italic>T. indica</italic> in these communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p>The high value attached to <italic>T. indica</italic> has contributed to its continued existence in the study areas. The low percentage of planting (45%) coupled with excessive cutting, low monetary value attached to <italic>T. indica</italic> products and competing landuses especially where population density is high, remain major challenges to its conservation. Having an intricate IK has not translated into high rates of planting <italic>T. indica</italic> or other conservation practices.</p><p>Although the communities lacked documented scientific evidence, their food and medicinal uses concurred with scientific reports of <italic>T. indica</italic> health promoting attributes. That IK and uses in the study area concurred with scientifically proven nutritional and medicinal attributes of <italic>T. indica</italic> in literature is very significant given current trends in the search for affordable functional foods. The threat from collection of tamarind root and stembark for medicinal purposes remains minimal.</p><p>There is need to increase overall tree conservation efforts since <italic>T. indica</italic> grows together with other tree species. For instance, planting fast maturing species for fuelwood and timber may help reduce pressure on <italic>T. indica</italic> for fuel thus conserving it for nondestructive uses such as provision of fruit and medicinal products. Efforts aimed at food security need to be aligned with environmental conservation to reinforce each other for effectiveness and maximum benefit to local communities.</p><p>The constraints reported with regard to planting <italic>T. indica</italic> need to be addressed so as to boost planting. For instance, long maturity period could be addressed by exploring various propagation methods that shorten the period between establishment and harvest of <italic>T. indica</italic>. There is also need to explore ways of increasing earnings from <italic>T. indica</italic>. Propagation of varieties with desirable characteristics for instance &#x02018;sweet fruit&#x02019; or &#x02018;high yielding&#x02019; need to be promoted. Concerns about limited land could be addressed through identifying potential locations for planting <italic>T. indica</italic> such as along boundaries, roads, compounds and public land. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the relationship between <italic>T. indica</italic> and surrounding plants.</p><p>Land and tree tenure arrangements that discourage women from planting <italic>T. indica</italic> need to be addressed. Empowering women to own land could be adopted as a long term strategy to promote planting of <italic>T. indica</italic> and other tree species for general environmental conservation. Sensitizing women about the nutritional benefits of various <italic>T. indica</italic> products could increase chances of tamarind being included in meals since it is women that are often involved in preparing meals and caring for the sick. Women are also more likely to plant and encourage their children to plant <italic>T. indica</italic> if knowledgeable about its nutritional and economic benefits.</p><p>The IK possessed by locals was shrouded in myths and superstitions. Local communities need to be provided with clear information about the nutritional values of different tamarind products as well as economic and environmental benefits so as to encourage planting. Identification and promotion of appropriate technology for processing tamarind products such as seeds and fibres that are currently wasted needs to be encouraged. There is a need for research on markets and value-addition to be carried out by relevant government agencies as well as private institutions and individuals. Provision of accurate and well packaged information will go a long way in restoring confidence in wild and semi-wild foods including <italic>T. indica</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FAO</term><def><p>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IK</term><def><p>Indigenous Knowledge</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Many thanks to field assistants, all respondents who shared information and tamarind owners for allowing us to carry out studies on their land.
