CRT is also recognized to deeply impact the immune response to altered self-cells. In this study, we focus on the role of the newly exposed CRT following cell death induction. We show that if CRT increases at the outer face of the plasma membrane and is well recognized by C1q even when phosphatidylserine is not yet detected, CRT is also released in the surrounding milieu and is able to interact with phagocytes. We observed that exogenous CRT is endocytosed by THP1 macrophages through macropinocytosis and that internalization is associated with a particular phenotype characterized by an increase of cell spreading and migration, an upregulation of CD14, an increase of interleukin-8 release, and a decrease of early apoptotic cell uptake. Importantly, CRT-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype was confirmed on human monocytes-derived macrophages by the overexpression of CD40 and CD274, and we found that monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to CRT display a peculiar polarization notably associated with a downregulation of the histocompatibility complex of class II molecules hampering its description through the classical M1/M2 dichotomy. Altogether our results highlight the role of soluble CRT with strong possible consequences on the macrophage-mediated immune response to dying cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calreticulin</kwd><kwd>C1q</kwd><kwd>apoptotic cells</kwd><kwd>macrophage polarization</kwd><kwd>CD14</kwd><kwd>efferocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="7533"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is now unambiguously demonstrated that the multifunctional protein calreticulin (CRT) plays an important role in the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) when exposed at their surface and accordingly in the immune response driven by the phagocyte (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>): first acting as an engulfment signal stimulating the recognition of dying cells by phagocytes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and second as an element of the antigen presentation machinery of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). It is now recognized, however, that CRT and more precisely cell surface-anchored CRT (that we will call ecto-CRT) interacts and collaborates with other molecules known to impact the process of elimination of cells dedicated to die. Nevertheless, CRT appears to play a role on both sides of the phagocytic synapse (also named efferocytic synapse) as it is also expressed at the surface of the phagocyte membrane. Some of CRT&#x02019;s partners that modulate the whole efferocytosis process include other &#x0201c;eat-me&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;don&#x02019;t eat-me&#x0201d; signals, bridging or/and signaling molecules and endocytic receptors. These molecules are C1q (bridging molecule), phosphatidylserine (PS; &#x0201c;eat-me&#x0201d; signal), CD47 (&#x0201c;don&#x02019;t eat-me&#x0201d; signal), CD91/LRP (CRT receptor), and the scavenger receptor SRF-I (also called SREC-I or SCARF1) [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)]. Interestingly some of these molecules have been shown to interact together, suggesting that the CRT-mediated immune response could be regulated by complex multimolecular interactions.</p><p>For example, we and others (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) have demonstrated that CRT interacts with the emblematic eat-me signal PS and also binds to the complement C1q protein, a bridging molecule that is also a PS-binding protein. CRT was early described as a C1q co-receptor with CD91 at the surface of macrophage even if the role of this interaction needs to be clarified (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and to bind the SRF-I endocytic receptor (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Most strikingly, Ramirez-Ortiz et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have discovered that SRF-I on DCs, macrophages, and endothelial cells interacts with C1q-opsonized apoptotic cells and importantly that SRF-I-mediated uptake of apoptotic cells requires C1q and PS exposure on dying cells.</p><p>As it is noteworthy that ecto-CRT is capable of eliciting pro-inflammatory, immunogenic, signals in response to proapoptotic drugs used on cancer cells (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the knowledge that several of its partners such as PS, C1q, and SRF-I have a pivotal role in the maintenance of immune tolerance and prevention of immune diseases (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) added evidences that interplay of these molecules should be a key factor to balance the immune response to apoptotic cells.</p><p>Calreticulin amounts significantly increase at the surface of cells triggered to apoptosis, thus modulating the process of their elimination. Moreover, this protein is also found in the surrounding &#x0201c;efferocytic milieu&#x0201d; and at the surface of macrophages. CRT on macrophage has been described as a product of the macrophage (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) but obviously could also result from soluble CRT adsorption (i.e., CRT released from dying cells). Thus far, however, little is known about the balance between endogenous and exogenous CRT anchored at the macrophage surface and their role(s) during efferocytosis.</p><p>We have previously analyzed the role of ecto-CRT on HeLa apoptotic cells uptake by THP1 macrophages (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and demonstrated that CRT and C1q interact at the cell surface, playing together to modulate not only the uptake process but also signaling events. We observed indeed that a deficiency in CRT induces contrasting effects on cytokine release by THP1 macrophages, by increasing interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1/CCL2 and decreasing IL-8. Remarkably, these effects were greatly reduced when apoptotic cells were opsonized by C1q, which counterbalanced the effect of CRT deficiency. It allowed to stress the role of the CRT&#x02013;C1q interaction in this process and thereby to hypothesize that CRT effects are sharply delineated by its partnerships.</p><p>The present study focuses on the role of the newly exposed CRT following cell death induction using UVB irradiation. We developed a model of non-adherent cells that are harvested by simple centrifugation steps that facilitate the analysis of membrane-associated extracellular proteins. Here, we show that if ecto-CRT content increases before PS, the emblematic marker of apoptosis, can be detected, it is rapidly released in the medium. We investigated the functional consequences of this early release of CRT by apoptotic cells on macrophages. Notably, we observed that exogenous CRT is endocytosed by THP1 macrophages and that internalization, in turn, triggers a pro-inflammatory response. To better understand the activation state of macrophages resulting from the CRT exposition, we analyzed several surface markers associated with different polarization of human macrophages. The resulting phenotype of macrophages is associated with the secretion of the chemokine IL-8, an increase in the migration speed, and a decrease in the apoptotic cells phagocytosis ability, together with a decrease in the expression of the major histocompatibility complex of class II. These results highlight the profound consequences of the release of CRT by early dying cells, acting as a &#x0201c;chaperokine&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), on the immune system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Human blood samples from healthy donors (buffy coat) were obtained from Etablissement Fran&#x000e7;ais du Sang under the authorization number (CODECOH DC-2015-2502) with a signed consent.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Cell Culture, Apoptosis Induction, and Macrophage Differentiation</title><p>JurkaT and THP1cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen).

Cells were then incubated for various times at 37&#x000b0;C. Apoptotic state of cells was assessed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Kit (MACS MiltenyiBiotec) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. THP1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophage-like cells by treating with 10&#x02009;nM PMA for 48&#x02009;h (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).

Surface CRT was then analyzed by flow cytometry. For effect on CD14 expression, the dose of 6&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml was determined experimentally (preliminary study). For control experiments, THP1 cells were cultured in the presence of polymyxin B (5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) to avoid the effect of a potential LPS contamination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque 1077 from Sigma-Aldrich).

Cells were then washed in PBS, fixed for 7&#x02009;min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature, and saturated with PBS-1% BSA for 15&#x02009;min. Both anti-CRT antibody or chicken isotype IgY control (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml in the saturation solution were added for 45&#x02009;min at RT. Cells were then washed twice in PBS before incubation in the dark for 30&#x02009;min with cyanine-3-conjugated donkey anti-chicken Ig secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1/200). Cells were finally washed and suspended in PBS before flow cytometry analysis. To control the percentage of necrotic permeabilized cells in the whole population, staining with propidium iodide (1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) was established for each condition. For THP1 labeling, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution. Cells were fixed in PFA and stained for ecto-CRT as described above. CD14 labeling of THP1 (anti CD14-PE, clone RMO52, Beckman Coulter) was performed without fixation. For labeling of macrophages obtained from monocytes, antibodies used were CD40 FITC (clone HB14), CD14 FITC (clone T&#x000dc;K4), CD206 PE (clone DCN228), CD74 APC (clone 5-239), CD274 APC (clone MIH18), HLA-DR APC (clone AC122), and the corresponding isotypes (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells doublets were gated out by comparison of forward scatter signal height and forward scatter signal area. Dead cells were eliminated with 7AAD or FSC/SSC profile. For all experiments, FcR blockade was performed with the FcR-blocking solution (Miltenyi Biotec). Flow cytometry analyses were performed with MACSQuant VYB cytometer (Miltenyi Biotech, M4D cell imaging platform, IBS), and collected data were treated with MACSQuantify software or with an Accuri C6 (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer.

During our work with JurkaT cells, we noted that the incubation of these cells in medium without FCS induces their adherence to the culture plate. This may be due to the absence of factors probably contained in FCS.

Apoptotic JurkaT cells were then added to THP1-derived macrophages that had been preincubated or not with CRT, at a ratio of 10:1 (JurkaT:THP1), for 1&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were washed and harvested with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and then labeled for CD14 as described above for 15&#x02009;min at room temperature and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Phagocytosis was calculated as the percentage of the double CFSE and CD14-PE-labeled cells in the THP1 macrophage population (CD14-PE-positive cells). Significance was tested using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3-1"><title>Ecto-CRT Increases Rapidly after UVB Irradiation and before PS Exposure and Then Is Released in the Surrounding Milieu</title><p>One of our primary interests was to follow the dynamic CRT exposure following the death induction. For this, we settled a dying cell model with the non-adherent JurkaT cell line that allows us to efficiently access cell surface, i.e., without scraping the cells that could alter the cell membrane. We thus verified that whether under UVB radiation, a known inducer of apoptosis, CRT expression at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We confirmed, by double Annexin V/anti-CRT cell surface labeling, that CRT increased significantly 30&#x02009;min after UVB treatment at the cell surface even though PS translocation was still not detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A; untreated and 30&#x02009;min post-UVB conditions), in agreement with previously published data (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). After 120&#x02009;min post-UVB treatment, when apoptosis is characterized by a huge increase of PS-positive cells, more than 90% of the PS-positive cells also expose ecto-CRT at their surface. Interestingly the observation that the portion of ecto-CRT-positive cells measured at 30&#x02009;min becomes PS positive at 120&#x02009;min strongly suggests that CRT translocation to the membrane could be an initial and potentially a required step, for apoptosis development under the UV stimulus.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Calreticulin (CRT) is exposed rapidly after UVB irradiation at the cell surface and released in the medium. <bold>(A)</bold> Uuntreated or UVB-irradiated JurkaT cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for their phosphatidylserine (PS) (Annexin V-FITC) and CRT (anti-CRT antibody/secondary antibody-Cy3) surface exposure.

An initial approach was to analyze the effect of the medium conditioned by UVB-irradiated JurkaT cells, which contains the released CRT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), on the macrophage. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, THP1 macrophages when incubated with the UVB-irradiated JurkaT cells conditioned medium collected 120&#x02009;min posttreatment (IR120 as referred on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, which contains the greater amount of CRT) are more labeled for CRT on their surface in contrast to those incubated with normal medium or medium conditioned by viable cells. This increase was measured for short incubation time (1&#x02009;h), which indicates most likely that the extracellular CRT from the medium binds to the macrophage cell surface rather than it was due to newly expressed endogenous CRT. Further experiments were then conducted using recombinant CRT (rCRT) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) to analyze its role(s) on the macrophage biology. Interestingly rCRT conjugated with Alexa 488 was shown to be efficiently ingested in large vesicles by the THP1 macrophages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). To characterize the endocytic route, we tested the effect of several endocytosis inhibitors. As expected, general inhibitors such as sodium azide (NaN3) (data not shown) or Cytochalasin D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C) blocked the uptake of rCRT. Finally, EIPA or amiloride, a specific inhibitor of macropinocytosis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), was shown to markedly inhibit the ingestion of the exogenous rCRT-A488 by the THP1 macrophages.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Soluble calreticulin (CRT) binds to phagocyte and is endocytosed. <bold>(A)</bold> THP1 macrophages were incubated with normal medium (blue), medium conditioned by control (green), or apoptotic (red) JurkaT cells.

CD11b and CD11c expression (&#x003b1;M integrin and &#x003b1;X integrin subunits, respectively) are upregulated in response to PMA stimulation without any detectable effect of rCRT (data not shown). In contrast, adding rCRT enhanced CD14 expression in the THP1 population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). This increase of surface CD14 was almost half of what is obtained with LPS and was very efficiently inhibited by blocking endocytosis with sodium azide. As controls, pretreatment of recombinant CRT with pronase to degrade CRT protein abolished this effect; and in addition, a similar increase in CD14 expression was obtained using CRT purified from human placenta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). This ensures that our observation was not significantly affected by LPS endotoxin contamination. Accordingly, we reproduced CRT effect on CD14 expression in the presence of 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml of polymyxin B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A).

As we have previously shown, CRT is a common PS and C1q partner and could modulate C1q binding to apoptotic cell surface through a possible interference with the PS&#x02013;C1q interaction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We have tested the C1q interaction with surface-exposed CRT at the early stages of apoptosis, when PS is not yet detected. Herein, we were able to show, by FRET measurements, that CRT and C1q bind together. This argues in the favor of a physiological function of CRT-dependent C1q opsonization at the very beginning of the programmed cell death process, even though its real effect, either on apoptotic cell uptake or on phagocyte signaling events, remains to be studied in detail. We then observed that ecto-CRT, which appears to initially increase at the cell surface, is secondarily released in the surrounding milieu and could bind to the surface of neighboring macrophages. To understand the potential effect of soluble CRT on macrophages, we showed that on THP1 macrophages, the recombinant CRT is efficiently endocytosed by a macropinocytosis-like process. This internalization was associated with (i) an increase secretion of a pro-inflammatory chemokine (IL-8), (ii) an increase in cell spreading and cell migration as it has been already reported (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and (iii) an upregulation of the expression of CD14 molecules. Importantly, the CRT-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype was confirmed on human monocytes-derived macrophages by the overexpression of CD40 and CD274. If our results point toward a pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages, CRT-induced polarization displays a peculiar expression of surface markers with strong possible consequences on the immune system. We found that the expression of HLA-DR, which is deeply involved in the presentation of antigens, and to a lesser extent CD74, also a MHC-II molecule that helps guiding the CD74&#x02013;MHC-II complex move on to the endolysosomal pathway, are downregulated by the exposition to CRT. This result suggests that macrophage exposed to CRT could have an antigen presentation mechanism by the MHC-II pathway impaired leading to a decreased ability to recruit and activate helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Because CRT enhances the stabilities of components of the MHC class I assembly pathway (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), it is tempting to suggest that CRT could favor the use of a cross presentation as an antigen presentation mechanism for macrophages.</p><p>Altogether our results suggest that CRT mainly intracellular on viable cells, rapidly exposed on apoptotic cell surface and efficiently released is a significant &#x0201c;inducing signal&#x0201d; for macrophages, able to modulate macrophage polarization. In support to this proposition, Bajor and collaborators (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) have previously demonstrated that CRT induced the maturation of human DCs and increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Of note, this DC maturation was found particularly clear when the conditioned medium obtained by monocytes exposed to CRT was used. This conditioned medium was able to induce a strong maturation of DCs associated with CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR overexpression and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors like IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#x003b1;. The hypothesis proposed for this effect is the activation through TLRs of the NF-kB pathway induced by released factors present in the conditioned medium (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It has been reported that murine CRT is unable <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to induce the maturation of DCs contrary to what is found with human cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The mechanism by which CRT could directly activate human macrophages is not known and will need further investigations.</p><p>Our finding that soluble CRT can be internalized through a macropinocytosis-like process, together with the observed effect of CRT on HLA-DR expression on monocyte-derived macrophages add clues for a potential role of CRT in the regulation of antigen presentation. Given that phagocytosis is tightly dependent on macrophages polarization and because CD14 expression ties to macrophage differentiation, we tested the CRT-treated THP1 macrophages for their ability to engulf apoptotic cells. Interestingly, we noted a significant CD14-dependent decrease of the phagocytosis events when CRT-treated and CRT-untreated THP1 macrophages were compared. This should also account for a more efficient polarization into M1-like type macrophages, less able to eat altered self-cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) than M2 macrophages and strongly argues for an important functional role of CRT in the phagocytosis process not only as an &#x0201c;eat-me&#x0201d; signal. Notably, CD14 was characterized as a macrophage tethering receptor for apoptotic cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>); thus, our observation also underlines that this receptor is not uniquely or directly linked to the uptake process but more likely to signaling and/or regulating events.</p><p>Why soluble CRT induces a pro-inflammatory signal and a decrease of clearance of cells at the beginning of their death, whereas apoptotic cell membrane-anchored CRT was characterized as an &#x0201c;eat-me&#x0201d; signal, remains to be understood. For instance, we can hypothesize that delaying efferocytosis would help phagocyte reprogramming and also the onset of apoptotic cell-associated molecular patterns to guarantee the adapted immune response to apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PF designed the study and analyzed and interpreted data.
