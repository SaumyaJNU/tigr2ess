    "Patients with de Winter syndrome, also termed anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-equivalent, represent 2% of all patients with acute anterior myocardial infarctions admitted to emergency departments (EDs). STEMI-equivalents do not present with classical electrocardiogram (ECG) changes but exhibit a critical stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. This is under-recognized by clinicians and is therefore associated with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we report a rare case of a novel, typical, STEMI-equivalent ECG pattern without obvious ST-segment elevation in a 34-year-old female who presented to our ED with substantial chest pain and a large, acute, transmural anterior myocardial infarction caused by acute occlusion of the LAD coronary artery. However, she presented as a non-STEMI case. A definite diagnosis of de Winter syndrome was made on the basis of clinical and ECG findings."
