Agronomic approaches such as application of Zn fertilizers to soil and/or foliar spray seem to be a practical tool for Zn biofortification of wheat. However, there is a need to evaluate its efficacy from randomized controlled trials. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zinc biofortified wheat flour on zinc status and its impact on morbidity among children aged 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years and non-pregnant non lactating woman of child bearing age (WCBA) in Delhi, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In a community based, double-masked randomized controlled trial, 6005 participants (WCBA and child pairs) were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either high zinc biofortified wheat flour (HZn, 30&#x000a0;ppm zinc daily) or low zinc biofortified wheat flour (LZn, 20&#x000a0;ppm zinc daily) for 6&#x000a0;months (WCBA @ 360&#x000a0;g/day and children @ 120&#x000a0;g/day). Baseline and endline blood samples were obtained for assessing hematological markers; zinc status and data on compliance and morbidity were collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Compliance rates were high; ~&#x02009;88% of the WCBAs in both the groups consumed 50% or more of recommended amount of biofortfied wheat flour during the follow up. Similarly 86.9% children in HZn and 87.5% in LZn consumed 50% or more of recommended wheat flour intake. There was no significant difference in mean zinc levels between the groups at end study. This observation might be due to a marginal difference in zinc content (10&#x000a0;ppm) between the HZn and LZn wheat flour, and a short intervention period. However a positive impact of bio-fortification on self-reported morbidity was observed. Compared to children in LZn group, children in HZn group had 17% (95% CI: 6 to 31%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) and 40% (95% CI: 16 to 57%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0019) reduction in days with pneumonia and vomiting respectively. WCBA in the HZn group also showed a statistically significant 9% fewer days with fever compared to LZn group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Biofortified wheat flour had a good compliance among children and WCBAs. Significant improvement on some of the self-reported morbidity indicators suggests that evaluating longer-term effects of biofortification with higher grain zinc content would be more appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials">http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/</ext-link>, CTRI/2014/04/004527, Registered April 7, 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12937-018-0391-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Zinc</kwd><kwd>Biofortification</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Woman of child-bearing age</kwd><kwd>Morbidity</kwd><kwd>Plasma zinc</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Harvest Plus</institution></funding-source><award-id>114666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sazawal</surname><given-names>Sunil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par26">Micronutrient malnutrition has been recognized as a huge and rapidly growing public health problem around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More than two billion people worldwide suffer from micronutrient deficiency (especially of zinc and iron) and zinc ranks fifth in the leading risk factors for illness and disease in developing countries with high mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Estimates indicate that approximately 20.5% of the world&#x02019;s population might be at risk of zinc deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].&#x000a0;In India, estimated 25.9% population is at risk of inadequate zinc intake, and is considered to be high-risk category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Risk factors include insufficient dietary intake due to poverty, food taboos and vegetarian diets that are high in phytate and fiber, poor utilization due to environmental factors such as poor hygiene that lead to increased infections and infestations, adverse zinc iron interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and genetic causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].The dietary intake of preschool children in the urban slums of India is no better than those of rural population of India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].Women of reproductive age (WRA) are also vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies, including that of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Poor maternal zinc status has been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], including spontaneous abortion, congenital malformation, low birth weight, and preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par27">Micronutrient deficiencies can be alleviated by direct (nutrition-specific) and indirect (nutrition-sensitive) interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Direct interventions focus on consumption behavior and include dietary diversification, micronutrient supplementation, modification of food choices and fortification. Nutrition-sensitive interventions address the underlying determinants of malnutrition and include biofortification. Biofortification is the process of increasing the content and/or bioavailability of essential nutrients in crops during plant growth through genetic and agronomic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Genetic biofortification involves either genetic engineering or classical breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Agronomic biofortification is achieved through micronutrient fertilizer application to the soil and/or foliar application directly to the leaves of the crop. Even though this approach seems simple and inexpensive, this strategy has been successful in only limited cases and in particular geographical locations due to the limitations of fertilizer and soil chemistry, together with the added complications of nutrient mobility and storage within the plant.</p><p id="Par28">Although zinc supplementation has been proven to be cost effective strategy in reducing morbidity and improving growth, giving zinc supplementation daily is not feasible as a program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] thus, other sustainable methods such as food based intervention to increase zinc intakes need to be explored and evaluated. Plant breeding of staple crops, such as wheat or rice, to increase the zinc concentration can be a promising approach to increase zinc intakes of populations in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In northern India, although the consumption of cereals has declined in the past few decades, wheat consumption has shown no significant change and has the highest dietary share; contributing more than 50% calories to the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which is similar to consumption in many developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, biofortification of wheat can be one of the novel food based approaches, which can provide higher levels of micronutrients directly into key staple foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Recently, Harvest Plus and its partners have developed wheat lines that can achieve zinc concentration of 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;ppm when adequately fertilized with zinc, adding ~&#x02009;20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;ppm of zinc in the daily diet of children (aged 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years) and women of reproductive age. However, there is lack of scientific evidence from randomized controlled trials for its efficacy in improving zinc nutritional status and related health outcomes in the target population groups. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of high zinc biofortified wheat flour on zinc status, prevention of morbidity and growth among children aged 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years and non pregnant non lactating women aged 15&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years compared to group that received low zinc biofortified wheat flour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and setting</title><p id="Par30">This study was carried out in Sangam Vihar, a resettlement colony in outskirts of south Delhi; and Harsh Vihar, a semi-urban locality in North East District, Delhi, India.

The wheat variety used for control and intervention groups was a commercial variety (PBW 550) developed and released by Punjab Agricultural University in 2007. Standard farming techniques as prescribed in the package and practices recommended by Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana were followed during the entire growing period. Low zinc biofortified wheat was grown in agro-ecological conditions that limit the uptake of soil zinc by plants and received no additional zinc fertilization. The wheat (HZn) for the intervention group was grown in agro-ecological conditions and additional foliar spraying of 0.5% zinc sulphate fertilizer that foster the zinc uptake by the plant and its deposit in the growing seeds was done. PBW 550 is not a genetically modified organism (GMO) and was grown at farmers&#x02019; fields in Punjab (districts Kapurthala and Bathinda), India.

To prevent sharing of ration with other family members, additional 200&#x000a0;g wheat flour daily per household was provided to the family in both the groups. Wheat flour for family members was same as was given to the participant (HZn or LZn). Participants were followed up on a weekly basis by the study worker for collection of compliance, morbidity information and medication/supplement use. On each visit, the compliance (adherence with the intervention) was assessed by collecting the information on reported intake of biofortified wheat flour in terms of number of days it was being offered and consumed, portion size consumed and unused quantity recovered.

The study was conducted in a low resource setting in India with high levels of zinc deficiency among children and women of child&#x000a0;bearing age.</p><p id="Par56">In our study, consumption of high zinc biofortified wheat flour for 6&#x000a0;months compared to low zinc biofortified wheat resulted in statistically significant reduction in days with pneumonia and vomiting among children and days with fever among women of reproductive age. Similar findings have been reported by earlier zinc supplementation randomized controlled trials showing an effect of zinc supplementation in decreasing morbidity and mortality in children due to gastrointestinal and respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Participants in all the zinc supplementation studies were supplemented with zinc daily, over and above regular dietary intake and dose of zinc supplementation ranged from 10&#x000a0;mg to 20&#x000a0;mg and duration from 4.6 to 18&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par57">There is limited evidence available on the efficacy of zinc biofortified crops. Rosado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] carried out a trial among 27 women who consumed 300&#x000a0;g of 95% or 80% extracted wheat flour of tortillas for 2 consecutive days using either biofortified (41&#x000a0;mg Zn/g) or control (24&#x000a0;mg Zn/g) wheat. Zn intake from the biofortified wheat was higher at 80% extraction compared with the corresponding control wheat (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007).&#x000a0;In India, Kodkany et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] provided zinc&#x000a0;and iron biofortified pearl millet flour to children under 2&#x000a0;years and concluded that quantities of zinc absorbed from biofortified pearl millet as the major food staple is more than adequate to meet the physiological requirements of these nutrients. Study from Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] indicated that feeding biofortified maize could meet zinc requirements and provide an effective dietary alternative to regular maize. In contrast the grain zinc concentrations levels achieved using the agronomic Zn foliar sprays/fertilizers in our study were very low. In our study the high zinc biofortified wheat would have at best delivered 3.6&#x000a0;mg/d of zinc to children and 10.8&#x000a0;mg/d to women if they had consumed 100% of recommended intake; in comparison the control group (low zinc biofortified wheat) would have delivered 2.4&#x000a0;mg/d to children and 7.8&#x000a0;mg/d to women. The daily Zn requirement is 15&#x000a0;mg for both adults and children that are 4 and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To meet this allowance wheat grains should contain 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>Zn.&#x000a0;Although&#x000a0;there was an improvement in zinc status (plasma zinc levels&#x0003e;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/dL) within each group but given the adjuvant used to enhance zinc absorption through the leaves was not optimal and the minimum expected increase of 20&#x000a0;ppm over the low biofortified wheat was not achieved, this improvement was similar between the groups. This study does indicate the potential for use of biofortification as a means of improving zinc nutrition with a caveat to improve the biofortification process such that wheat grains contain 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>Zn to meet the recommended dietary allowance of Zn.</p><p id="Par58">Zinc bioavailability pilot trial designed to estimate the amount of zinc absorbed from zinc rice compared to conventional rice using the triple stable isotope tracer ratio technique, failed to produce detectable differences in absorbed zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. High phytate and lower-than-expected zinc in the biofortified zinc variety was suggested as a cause for no significant difference in absorption between groups. Zinc uptake by wheat and translocation into the grains is affected by genetic-environment interactions and evidently by the efficiency of the foliar application of the fertilizer. In our study, the adjuvant used to enhance zinc absorption through the leaves was not optimal and could not produce the HZn variety with expected Zn content.</p><p id="Par058">There is sufficient evidence from previous studies undertaken in 7 countries over different seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that foliar zinc fertilization can increase both yields and nutritional quality of crops. In these studies there was an average increase of 77% over controls (from 29&#x000a0;ppm to 48&#x000a0;ppm). This efficacy trial affirms importance of zinc biofortification with adequate levels of Zn concentration. The data suggests that there was no bioavailability issue as the plasma zinc levels in both groups did improve substantially between baseline and endline. There has to be a significant differential between the two groups in terms of grain Zn content to be able to show the difference between the groups. The study results indicate that both children and WCBAs consumed a full ration of 120&#x000a0;g/360&#x000a0;g daily only on 55% to 60% of the days, although consumption of 50% or more of recommended intake was close to 90% which further outlines the importance of achieving higher grain Zn concentrations and continuous consumption for longer duration.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="Par59">One main limitation of the study was that the differential zinc content between HZn and LZn was marginal. The study was designed with 40&#x000a0;ppm difference between HZn and LZn but the wheat flour provided for the study had only 10&#x000a0;ppm differential between the two groups. The results of the study need to be inferred in this context. The shorter duration of the study (6&#x000a0;months) could be another limitation for finding meaningful differences between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">Biofortified wheat flour had a good compliance among children and women suggesting agronomic approaches such as application of Zn-containing fertilizers could be a good delivery mechanism. Significant improvement on some of the morbidity indicators suggests that evaluating longer term effects of biofortification with higher zinc content would be more appropriate. Research programs are needed to develop and improve Zn application methods in terms of form, dose, and application time of Zn fertilizers.The drive for higher yields is usually accompanied by a dilution effect of minerals due to the additional grain starch accumulation. The scientists and breeders need to work together to achieve required grain Zn contents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
