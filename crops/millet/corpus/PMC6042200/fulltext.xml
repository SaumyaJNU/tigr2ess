In developing countries, Childhood overweight and obesity have increased at an alarming rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2014, about 35 million children were affected by overweight or obesity, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity for children in China was 12.2 and 7.3% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These large increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity might greatly increase morbidity in adulthood from causes such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, research identifying risk factors of childhood obesity are needed to address this severe public health problem.</p><p id="Par6">Obesity is caused by an intricacy interaction among the environment, genetics and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among these factors, diet has been demonstrated to be a determinant in the development of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, owing to the complexity of diets and the potential associations between dietary components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the relationship between diet and obesity is intricate and barely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Compared with traditional dietary analyses focusing on individual foods or nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], dietary pattern analysis might be an alternative holistic and comprehensive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Dietary pattern analysis take advantage of complex diet, take into account multiple food groups instead of individual foods or nutrients, and can reveal potential interactions between various nutrients and food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Consequently, dietary pattern analysis might reflect the complexity of dietary intake and provide new insights into what people eat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, dietary pattern analysis has widely been used to determine associations between diet and chronic diseases and to aid in formulating nutritional recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In China, transition of dietary patterns is an ongoing phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Over the past 20&#x000a0;years, dietary patterns have transitioned from a traditional diet to a modern diet with high intake of refined grains and meat; the abundance of energy-dense food in the modern diet is cause for concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Dramatic changes in dietary patterns may explain the increase in obesity among children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, most previous studies have followed a cross-sectional design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and have focused primarily on adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Few studies have analyzed the long-term effects of dietary patterns and obesity in Chinese children or adolescents. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to characterize dietary patterns at baseline and to identify the associations between dietary patterns and later obesity in Chinese children and adolescents by using a longitudinal study design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="Par9">In the present investigation, we used longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), an open prospective cohort study.

The factor scores were orthogonally (varimax) rotated to create less correlation among the patterns and to facilitate interpretability. An eigenvalue is the variance of the factor. In the initial factor solution, the first factor will account for the most variance, the second will account for the next highest amount of variance, and so on. According to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], dietary patterns were identified on the basis of the eigenvalue (&#x0003e;&#x02009;2) and scree plot. Percentages of variances were also calculated. Factor loading of &#x0003e;|0.20| was included to represent the food strongly associated with the identified factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Pattern-specific factor scores were calculated as the sum of the food factor loading coefficients and the standardized daily consumption of food related to the dietary pattern. Factor scores were divided into four quartiles on the basis of their contribution to each pattern, and an increase from Q1 to Q4 was assumed.</p><p id="Par16">ANOVA tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables were used to compare the different quartiles in dietary patterns at baseline. Ordered logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for later childhood obesity across the quartile categories of dietary pattern score. Model 1 was adjusted for sex and age. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for residency, highest level of parental education, region, physical activity and energy intake. Model 3 additionally used a cluster analysis to reduce the spatial interdependence, which can adversely affect the robustness of regression estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; we used the classifications of geographical regions as cluster groups to analyze the association.</p><p id="Par17">To gain access to the full sample, we used the multiple imputation technique to fill in the missing values ten times, a procedure suggested to be sufficient in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Two dietary patterns were identified in the multicenter longitudinal study that satisfactorily captured eating habits (16.36% of dietary intake variance explained). The first pattern, the traditional Chinese dietary pattern, was characterized mainly by high consumption of rice, vegetables, pork, red meat, poultry and fish. The second pattern, the modern dietary pattern, consisted of a combination of wheat buns, bread, cake, cookies, legumes, pickled (salted) vegetables, fruits, nuts, red meat, processed meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk and fast food. The identified &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;modern&#x0201d; dietary patterns are similar to those reported previously conducted among adults in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In the present study, the traditional Chinese dietary pattern was inversely associated with later obesity, whereas the modern dietary pattern was positively associated with later obesity. Our results are comparable to those of previous studies. The Dutch Lifelines cohort study indicated that the healthier dietary pattern which have high intake of fruit, vegetables and fish were inversely associated with obesity, whereas the modern dietary pattern which have high intake of bread, potatoes and sweet snacks had a significantly increased risk of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In a 6-year prospective study conducted in UK, Ambrosini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] also reported that a dietary pattern high in meat, energy density and fat might be positively associated with obesity. However, previous studies have mainly focused on adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and cross-sectional designed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Some findings relating dietary patterns and obesity may not be applicable to Chinese adolescents and children, owing to cultural factors affecting intake.</p><p id="Par23">Overall, the present results suggested that the traditional Chinese dietary pattern may be protective against later obesity. The protective effect may be attributed to its healthful components. For example, the benefit of consuming whole grains, vegetables and legumes as part of the traditional Chinese dietary pattern may explain the protective effect in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. First, rice, an essential staple food in China, is a low-energy food that constitutes the bulk of the traditional Chinese diet. Energy density of rice is lower than that of wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Different methods are used in cooking rice and wheat. Steamed rice contains twice the amount of water and half the energy content as an equivalent amount of bread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Second, instead of organ and processed meats, the traditional Chinese dietary pattern includes a high intake of white meat, fish and seafood, which are all associated with a low prevalence of obesity. Fish has been found to be protective against obesity because of its omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. White meat has less fat than red meat, and the fats present are primarily healthful unsaturated fats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Another potential explanation for our findings may be vegetable intake. Vegetables that provide large amounts of dietary fiber, antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E) and water may contribute to decreasing the risk of later obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, in the present study, fresh leafy and non-leafy vegetables showed opposite effects in factor loadings. We assumed that the different cooking methods using in preparing vegetables might explain the opposite effects. For instance, stir-frying non-leafy vegetables in vegetable oil may increase energy density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The present study also found a higher risk of obesity associated with the modern dietary pattern. Previous studies have shown positive associations between modern dietary patterns abundant in saturated fat and cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and a higher risk of obesity. The associations between the modern dietary pattern and later obesity may be attributed to the high amounts of suboptimal foods together with the lower fiber intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Wheat gluten may promote weight gain, partly by decreasing the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Second, high consumption of red meat and processed meat, containing amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, is directly associated with an increased risk of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Another characteristic of the modern pattern is the use of the unhealthful cooking method deep-frying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Consumption of deep-fried fast food, such as potato chips and deep-fried dough, is of serious concern. A prospective cohort study has suggested that greater consumption of fried food is associated with a higher risk of obesity in follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Additionally, in this study, we found that milk and dairy products were positively associated with the modern pattern score. A previous study has suggested that milk intake associated with risk of childhood obesity, and the insulinotropic and IGF-1-raising effects of milk and dairy products may have further adverse effects on obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Moreover, excess energy intake may play a role in the development of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. After adjustment for energy intake, we found that the associations for each dietary pattern remained significant.</p><p id="Par25">To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the relations between dietary patterns and later obesity risk among the children and adolescents in China. Our findings provided valuable information for the primary prevention of childhood obesity through the dietary modifications in a Chinese children and adolescents. However, it is important to note some potential limitations. Firstly, the present study was limited by old data source and small sample sizes (here we report 489 participants) which may not necessarily representative of the general Chinese populations. Second, there was a high rate of loss of subjects to follow-up because of migration and city construction. However, there was no significant difference between those lost in follow-up and those retained. Thus, the association between dietary patterns and the risk of later obesity might not have been biased. Thirdly, dietary data were collected through three 24-h dietary recalls, which might not represent long-term usual intake, and using a baseline dietary data might provide a biased estimate. Fourthly, some subjective and arbitrary decisions should be considered, including the number of factors retained and the labeling of dietary patterns. However, these aspects are common to factor analyses, and the methodology has been validated and found satisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, even though we controlled for many covariates, there are still some potential socioeconomic and genetic factors that may have confounded our estimation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">In conclusion, the present study identified two dietary patterns among Chinese adolescents and children aged 6&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years at baseline: the traditional Chinese pattern and the modern pattern. The traditional Chinese dietary pattern was inversely associated with later obesity, whereas the modern dietary pattern was positively associated with later obesity. These findings further confirmed the importance of dietary patterns among children in later obesity and lay a groundwork for culture-specific interventions targeted at reducing rates of childhood obesity. Interventions aiming at discouraging the adoption of the modern dietary pattern, such as consumption of fried food, processed meat, and energy-dense foods, while encouraging the traditional Chinese dietary pattern, should be developed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).
