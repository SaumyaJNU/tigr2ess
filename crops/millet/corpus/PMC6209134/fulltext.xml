To do this, we used open field application of azoxystrobinon in four cucurbit crops (cucumber, zucchini, bitter gourd, and loofah) in Beijing, Shandong, and Anhui. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring was used to determine azoxystrobinon levels in each of the selected cucurbit vegetables. The azoxystrobinon limit of detection was 0.005 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for all samples. Recoveries of azoxystrobinon ranged from 94.2% to 107.1% at spiked levels of 0.005&#x02013;0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. In field trials, the half-life of azoxystrobinon in each of the four cucurbit crops was within the range of 1.4&#x02013;3.1 d. Based on these results, we recommend that bitter gourd is selected as a representative cucurbit vegetable for future studies of azoxystrobinon. The obtained residual data were also assessed for their dietary risk and results indicated that there is no chronic dietary risk in any of the four, selected cucurbit vegetables. The recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) of azoxystrobinon in this subgroup was 0.2 mg/kg.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>201503107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Fengmao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of China (grant: 201503107) to F.L.

Introduction</title><p>Cucumber <italic>(Cucumis sativus L</italic>.), zucchini <italic>(Cucurbita pepo Linn)</italic>, bitter gourd <italic>(Momordica charantia L</italic>.<italic>)</italic>, and loofah <italic>(Luffa cylindrica (L</italic>.<italic>) Roem</italic>.<italic>)</italic> are cultivated in many parts of the world and are especially prevalent in China. Despite their prevalence, zucchini, bitter gourd, and loofah are all regarded as minor crops. In most parts of world, these four crops account for a relatively small area of all crops cultivated. They typically form many small, specialty crops that cover a small and scattered cultivating area and use a limited amount of pesticides. Given these metrics, pesticide manufacturers are not willing to spend the time and money to register their products for such crops and therefore there are relatively few pesticide products registered for such small crops.</p><p>These problems are widely seen across the world. The EU and US along with the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) established crop classifications that contain delineated groups and subgroups [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2006, the CAC&#x02019;s Crop Classification Revision program began. Since then, crop grouping and group representative crops have been under discussions for 11 years and the work is not yet completed. This is not surprising, since there is a large amount of information and the task is complicated. Moreover, there is considerable controversy when selecting representative crops and formulating group MRLs. It is also worth noting that this classification&#x02014;when completed&#x02014;will enable small crops to use pesticides more scientifically and rationally.</p><p>The CAC divides crops into groups and subgroups and then selects representative crops from each subgroup. The representative crops are typically those with the highest residue or the most economic value in each groupand are used to determine suitableMRLs for the whole group. Currently, Group 011 Cucurbit Fruiting Vegetables is the CAC classification&#x02019;s biggest challenge. This group crop classification has been discussed for over four years, from the 45<sup>th</sup> International Commission on Pesticide Residues in the Codex Alimentarius (CCPR) to the 48<sup>th</sup> CCPR conference [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2015, the 47<sup>th</sup> CCPR discussedsubgroup 011 of the Cucurbit Fruiting Vegetables group. From these discussions, three options were proposed: Option 1 (three subgroups, supporting comments from Thailand and Japan): Subgroup 11A Cucumber and Summer Squash, Subgroup 11B Melons, and Subgroup 11C Winter squashes; Option 2 (two subgroups, International Crop Grouping Consulting Committee, supporting comments from Canada and the US): Subgroup 11A Melons and Subgroup 11B Squash/Cucumber subgroup; Option 3 (two subgroups, supporting comments from New Zealand): Subgroup 11A Cucurbits with Edible Peels and Subgroup 11B Cucurbits with Inedible Peels.</p><p>The main reason for the lack of consensus is that many cucurbit crops do not have relevant residual data. It took until the 49<sup>th</sup> CCPR to make a final decision regarding the Cucurbit Fruiting Vegetables, which was as follows: 011A Fruiting vegetables, Cucurbits (cucumbers and summer squashes) and 011B Fruiting vegetables, Cucurbits (melons, pumpkins, and winter squashes) [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This final agreement took several rounds of discussion because most countries and regions have no related residue data; particularly for zucchini, loofah, and bitter gourd.</p><p>Azoxystrobin, methyl (E)-2-{2[6-(2-cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin-4-yloxy] phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate, is a new type of efficient, broad-spectrum, systemic fungicide [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Strobilurins were first discovered from rotted Basidiomycetes [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Azoxystrobin, in particular, can be used for a variety of applications, including in stem and leaf sprays, seed treatments, and even be used to treat the soil itself. The mechanism of action of azoxystrobin is the blocking the bacteria c1 complex [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Azoxystrobin is similar to other strobilurins and has been shown to both increase the production and improve the quality of agricultural products [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Azoxystrobin and similar pesticides act to reduce post-harvest deterioration through anti-aging and water-saving physiological changes in the vegetables [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At present, there are few studies that have determined azoxystrobin levels in cucumber, as most studies assessing azoxystrobin have been done in cereal crops [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203967.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In previous studies, wheat and maize treated with azoxystrobin showed significant yield increases [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203967.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, no studies have determined azoxystrobin levels in cucurbit vegetables as a whole&#x02014;especially in bitter gourd, loofah, and zucchini.</p><p>This lack of information on azoxystrobin in cucurbit vegetables is concerning, given that it is used on many fruits and vegetables. While some papers have focused on the dietary risk of azoxystrobin, there has been little to no discussion on individual MRLs or group MRLs [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The main focus of the work presented here was to establish the MRLs in cucurbit vegetables. This was done to not only reduce pesticide exposure in humans, but also to provide a database for the crop classification of cucurbit vegetables. The Chinese classification of these crops includes the following categories: (a) cucumber and gherkins, (b) zucchini, bitter gourd, loofah, and (c) wax gourd and pumpkin [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The European Union&#x02019;s classification of fruiting vegetables is as follows: (a) Solanaceae and Malvaceae, (b) cucurbits with edible peel, and (c) cucurbits with inedible peel [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the US, the classification is as follows: (a) melons subgroup and (b) squash /cucumber subgroup [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2.

Recently, the CAC spent four years discussing the classification of cucurbit fruiting vegetables and whether to include them in the same group. The issue was finally resolved at the 49<sup>th</sup> CCPR. At present, nectarine and peach are in discussion to be included in the same crop group. However, the 100g/L WP of ethyl glutathione used in the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) report is applicable to nectarines and peaches. In the case of dosage, the half-lives of peach is 11.2 days and the half-life of nectarine is 22.6. Initial residue in peach is approximately five times higher than that of nectarine. This difference can also be divided into the same group; given this, peach can be chosen as a representative crop when extrapolating CAC crop classification [<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>3.3 Terminal residues in field trials</title><p>The terminal azoxystrobin residues on PHI 3, 5, and 7 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203967.g006">Fig 6</xref>.

In most countries, both regions and international organizations may choose the cucumber as a representative crop for use in trade and consumption. However, regions and international organizations must carefully set the MRLs, since the STMR of bitter gourd is 2.4&#x02013;5.5 times higher than that of cucumber.

The STMR and HR of bitter gourd were higher than the other tested cucurbit fruiting vegetables. Given the CAC principle, bitter gourd may be used to represent the highest azoxystrobin on residue of the four cucurbit vegetables subjected to open field pesticide application. As per CAC principles, the same subgroup&#x02019;s STMR needs to be less than five times to establish a subgroup MRLs. For example, sorghum and corn were initially in the same subgroup. However, comparison of the pesticide residue data revealed that they were in different subgroups: Subgroup 020D Grain Sorghum and Millet, Subgroup 020E Maize Cereals.</p><fig id="pone.0203967.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203967.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>The STMR and HR of the tested cucurbit fruiting vegetables.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0203967.g007"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>3.4 Health risk assessment</title><p>Public concern for pesticide residue risk has increased steadily; therefore, in this study, chronic and acute exposure risk assessment for different groups of people in China were investigated. These groups were chosen based on light-colored vegetable consumptions. After the chronic risk assessment, we used the average residue and STMR to establish the MRLs. Our dietary exposure assessment used both acute and chronic metrics. According to JMPR&#x02019;s 2011 report, azoxystrobin&#x02019;s acute reference dose (ARfD) is unnecessary because short-term intake does not pose a serious dietary risk to humans. Therefore, this study did not evaluate the acute exposure of azoxystrobin when found on melon vegetables.</p><p>The measures used for acute dietary exposure assessment were estimated short-term intake (ESTI) and ARfD. Chronic dietary exposure assessments were calculated based on estimated daily intake (EDI, mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, bw) and acceptable daily intake (ADI, mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, bw). They also accounted for the risk of the entire life-cycle. A risk quotient (RQc) &#x0003e; 100% indicated an unacceptable risk. The correlation equation used was RQc = EDI / ADI and a RQc &#x0003c;100% indicated no chronic dietary risk. The residual data we obtained were then used to establish corresponding group MRLs.

The STMR of cucumber (n = 7) was 0.015 mg/kg while the STMR of melon (n = 7) was 0.065 mg/kg. The STMR of zucchiniresidue (n = 6) was 0.047 mg/kg. The residue ratio of melon/cucumber = 0.065/0.015 = 4.3 while the ratio of zucchini/cucumber = 0.047/0.015 = 3.1.

[<xref rid="pone.0203967.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other methods used to establish the MRLs were the OECD and NAFTA calculators, which were as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>OECD: HR, Mean residue+4SD and CF&#x000d7;3 mean residue, where CF indicates correction factor, which is generally equal to 1.0.

For the ND or &#x0003c;LOQ residual value in the test data, the input was replaced by the LOQ value using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). When more than 60% of the residual data were unable to be accurately quantified, the NAFTA calculator should be used with caution.

The recommend MRL of azoxystrobin in the subgroup was determined to be 0.2 mg/kg. The MRL of azoxystrobin in cucumber of China was determined to be 0.5 mg/kg. The MRL of azoxystrobin in cucumber in the EU was determined to be 1.0 mg/kg. The MRL of azoxystrobin in cucurbits with edible peel in the EU was determined to be 1.0 mg/kg. The CAC and US do not have related MRLs and the different GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) directly impacts MRLs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>Based on both the planting area and consumption, we chose cucumber as our representation cucurbit crop. However, bitter gourd may have the highest azoxystrobinon residue after open field application of the four tested cucurbit crops. Given our findings, it is feasible to put cucumber, bitter gourd, loofah, and zucchini in the same subgroup. The half-lives of azoxystrobinon on the four cucurbit vegetables were within the range of 1.4&#x02013;3.1 days. We found no chronic dietary risk of azoxystrobinon in these four cucurbit vegetables. The recommended MRLs of azoxystrobinon in this subgroup was found to be 0.2 mg/kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203967.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Standard curve equations and relative analyte parameters in Cucurbitaceae fruiting vegetables.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203967.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203967.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Recoveries and relative standard deviations of azoxystrobin in Cucurbitaceae fruiting vegetables.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203967.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203967.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Half-life and other statistical parameters for azoxystrobin in the four tested Cucurbitaceae fruiting vegetables.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203967.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203967.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Chronic risk assessment of azoxystrobin in the four Cucurbitaceae fruiting vegetables.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203967.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of China (201503107).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0203967.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">EU crop classification. 2017. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/standard_setting_bodies/codex/ccpr/archives_en">https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/standard_setting_bodies/codex/ccpr/archives_en</ext-link></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0203967.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">EPA crop classification. 2017. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/pesticide-tolerance-crop-grouping-revisions">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/pesticide-tolerance-crop-grouping-revisions</ext-link></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0203967.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">JOINT FAO/WHO FOOD STANDARDS PROGRAMME CODEX COMMITTEE ON PESTICIDE RESIDUES 45th Session.
