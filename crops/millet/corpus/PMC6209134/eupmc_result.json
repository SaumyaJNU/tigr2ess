    "The goal of this study was to select a representative cucurbit vegetable crop that contained the highest residue levels of the pesticide azoxystrobinon. To do this, we used open field application of azoxystrobinon in four cucurbit crops (cucumber, zucchini, bitter gourd, and loofah) in Beijing, Shandong, and Anhui. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with selected reaction monitoring was used to determine azoxystrobinon levels in each of the selected cucurbit vegetables. The azoxystrobinon limit of detection was 0.005 mg kg-1 for all samples. Recoveries of azoxystrobinon ranged from 94.2% to 107.1% at spiked levels of 0.005-0.5 mg kg-1. In field trials, the half-life of azoxystrobinon in each of the four cucurbit crops was within the range of 1.4-3.1 d. Based on these results, we recommend that bitter gourd is selected as a representative cucurbit vegetable for future studies of azoxystrobinon. The obtained residual data were also assessed for their dietary risk and results indicated that there is no chronic dietary risk in any of the four, selected cucurbit vegetables. The recommended maximum residue limit (MRL) of azoxystrobinon in this subgroup was 0.2 mg/kg."
