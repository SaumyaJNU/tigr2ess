    "Streptomyces kanasenisi ZX01 was found to produce a novel glycoprotein GP-1 previously, which was secreted into medium and had significant activity against tobacco mosaic virus. However, the low production of GP-1 by strain ZX01 limited its further studies. In order to improve the yield of GP-1, a series of statistical experimental design methods were applied to optimize medium of strain ZX01 in this work. Millet medium was chosen to be the optimal original medium for optimization. Soluble starch and yeast extract were identified as the optimal carbon and nitrogen source using one-factor-at-a-time method. Response surface methodology was used to optimize medium compositions (soluble starch, yeast extract and inorganic salts). A higher yield of GP-1 was 601.33 µg/L after optimization. The optimal compositions of medium were: soluble starch 13.61 g/L, yeast extract 4.19 g/L, NaCl 3.54 g/L, CaCO3 0.28 g/L, millet, 10 g/L. The yield of GP-1 in a 5 L fermentor using optimized medium was 2.54 mg/L, which is much higher than the result of shake flask. This work will be helpful for the improvement of GP-1 production on a large scale and lay a foundation for developing it to be a novel anti-plant virus agent."
