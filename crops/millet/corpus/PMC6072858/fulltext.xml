Biostimulants are materials that stimulate plant growth, and gelatin, an animal protein hydrolysate, is classified as one type of biostimulant. Gelatin has a unique amino acid composition with a high percentage of proline and hydroxyproline. In a series of experiments gelatin capsules (#3 hard gelatin) containing 7.1 mg nitrogen each, were placed adjacent to seeds of different crop species, at sowing time in individual growing containers and several growth parameters were measured. Different types of hydrolyzed collagen, including granulated gelatin, gelatin hydrolysate, and amino acid mixtures simulating the composition of gelatin were compared on cucumber plant growth. In addition, amino acid mixtures without proline, hydroxyproline, or applied in combination were investigated on cucumber growth. All capsule treatments significantly enhanced crop growth compared to the non-treated control. The treatment with two gelatin capsules placed adjacent to each seed increased shoot dry weight of cucumber, pepper, broccoli, tomato, arugula, and field corn, by 138, 244, 50, 45, 41, and 18 percent, respectively. In an experiment with cucumber alone, there was a positive linear relationship between the number of gelatin capsules from 0 to 3 capsules on plant growth and plant nitrogen content. Cucumber growth and plant nitrogen content was greater from the hydrolyzed collagen treatment compared with the low molecular weight gelatin hydrolysate, a mixture of amino acids or urea and all treatments provided an equivalent amount of nitrogen. Proline and/or hydroxyproline were not responsible for the biostimulant effect. In summary, gelatin provided nitrogen that enhanced plant growth. Moreover, gelatin was an effective biostimulant as the plant growth and nitrogen content was greater from two gelatin capsules compared to amino acid mixture of the same proportion and amount as the gelatin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amino acid</kwd><kwd>biostimulant</kwd><kwd>gelatin</kwd><kwd>hydrolyzed collagen</kwd><kwd>nitrogen uptake</kwd><kwd>seed enhancement</kwd><kwd>vegetable crops</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Seed enhancement is a term widely used in the industry to describe beneficial techniques performed to seeds post-harvest, but prior to sowing (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>).

The European Biostimulants Industry Council (EBIC) developed a definition for plant biostimulants; &#x0201c;substance(s) and/or microorganisms whose function when applied to plants or the rhizosphere is to stimulate natural processes to enhance/benefit nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, and crop quality.

Gelatin, an animal based protein hydrolysate (hydrolyzed collagen) is one category of plant biostimulants.</p><p>Gelatin is defined as a mixture of peptides and proteins that are generally derived from partial hydrolysis of collagen obtained from connective tissues of animals which can include skin and bones (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gelatin Manufacturers Institute of America, 2012</xref>). Gelatin is soluble in water and in most polar solvents. A measure of gelatin strength is termed &#x02018;Bloom.&#x02019; The higher the Bloom number, the stronger the gel. The Bloom number is positively related to average molecular mass (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Courts, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gelatin Manufacturers Institute of America, 2012</xref>). The amino acid contents of protein hydrolysates vary depending on the production method as well as the source of the material. Animal based hydrolysates, such as gelatin, contain a high proportion of proline and glycine, while plant based hydrolysates contain a high proportion of glutamine and arginine (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Parrado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ertani et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Calvo et al., 2014</xref>). Gelatin contains 18 amino acids (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>) and the molecular size distribution for amino acids present in hydrolyzed gelatin ranges from 89.1 to 204.2 g mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Schrieber and Gareis, 2007</xref>). About 50% of the total amino acids in gelatin are glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>). A gelatin molecule is composed of an average of 1,000 amino acids per chain and there are a few disulfide bonds in gelatin molecular structure (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Belitz et al., 2004</xref>). Hydroxyproline is especially important for its primary role in the structure and maintenance of gelatin. Hydroxyproline is found in the cell wall proteins in plants (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lamport, 1965</xref>), and is derived from glycoprotein present in the primary cell walls (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kieliszewski and Shpak, 2001</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of amino acids and their relative amount in 1 g of gelatin protein (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gelatin Manufacturers Institute of America, 2012</xref>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid (mg/g) of gelatin protein</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid equivalent of one capsule (mg)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alanine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">113</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arginine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">90</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aspartic acid</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glutamic acid</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glycine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">272</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Histidine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hydroxylysine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hydroxyproline</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">133</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Isoleucine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leucine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lysine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Methionine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenylalanine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proline</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">155</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Threonine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tyrosine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Valine</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><attrib><italic>The calculated amino acid content of one gelatin capsule considering the moisture content of a gelatin capsule at 14% (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Buice et al., 1995</xref>).

However, in preliminary greenhouse studies, seeds placed inside gelatin capsules initially decreased the germination and seedling emergence rate, followed by enhanced growth (Wilson and Taylor, unpublished). The objective of this study was to investigate the biostimulant effect of the gelatin chemistry on plant growth without the deleterious effect of seed encapsulation. Therefore, capsules were placed adjacent to a seed in all experiments. In addition, only single seeds were placed near each gelatin capsule. The focus of this study was to first characterize the influence of gelatin capsule treatments on plant growth measured as dry weight and leaf area of several crops. Different types of hydrolyzed collagen [with molecular weight distribution (MWD) characterized] amino acids and nitrogen fertilizer were also evaluated as biostimulants with respect to plant dry weight and nitrogen content in cucumber. In these studies, gelatin was investigated both as a source of nitrogen and as a biostimulant enhancing plant nitrogen uptake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experiment 1: Capsule Treatments and Above Ground Growth of Selected Vegetable Crops and Field Corn</title><p>Six crops: cucumber &#x0201c;Vlaspik&#x0201d; (Seminis, Oxnard, CA, United States), arugula &#x0201c;Astro&#x0201d; (Sakata, Morgan Hill, CA, United States), broccoli &#x0201c;Centura&#x0201d; (Rogers, Boise, United States), tomato &#x0201c;Talladega&#x0201d; (Syngenta, Greensboro, NC, United States), pepper &#x0201c;Boynton Bell&#x0201d; (Harris Moran, Modesto, CA, United States), and field corn &#x0201c;Cornell D2901&#x0201d; (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States) were grown in a controlled greenhouse maintained at 24&#x000b0;C/21&#x000b0;C temperature with 14/10 h photoperiod at New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY, United States.

Two gelatin capsules placed adjacent to each seed increased dry weight of cucumber, pepper, broccoli, tomato, arugula, and field corn, by 138, 244, 50, 45, 41, and 18 percent, respectively, compared to the non-treated control (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Therefore, all crops investigated exhibited enhanced plant growth; however, the growth enhancement, measured by the percent increase in dry weight, compared to the non-treated control differed by species. This may be attributed to the uptake mechanism of hydrolyzed collagen that is the main ingredient in the gelatin capsules. Hydrolyzed collagen, a polypeptide, is comprised of amino acids, and the amino acids can be used as a nitrogen source in plant nutrition (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Schrieber and Gareis, 2007</xref>). Plants acquire nitrogen as nitrate and ammonium and as organic nitrogen in forms such as amino acids and protein from the soil (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nasholm et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Tegeder and Rentsch, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports have shown that the uptake of amino acids and proteins can vary between plant species (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto and Okada, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reeve et al., 2008</xref>). <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto and Okada (2004)</xref> investigated utilization of different forms of nitrogen (N) by four gramineous crops including sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>), rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), and pearl millet (<italic>Pennisetum glaucum</italic>). In their study, seedlings were grown without N, or with 500 mg N kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> applied to soil as ammonium nitrate, rice bran or a mixture of rice bran and straw. Shoot growth and N uptake in maize and pearl millet were correlated with the inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) concentration in the soil, suggesting that these species depend on, or have a preference for, inorganic N. In contrast, shoot growth and N uptake patterns in sorghum and rice indicated that these two species could compensate for low inorganic N levels by taking up organic nitrogen (proteins) from the rice bran and straw mixtures. Analysis of N uptake in solution culture experiments confirmed that sorghum and rice roots were more able to absorb N in the form of protein than maize and pearl millet (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto and Okada, 2004</xref>). <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reeve et al. (2008)</xref> conducted a study on differential uptake of amino acid-N by domestic (<italic>Fragaria fragaria</italic>) and wild strawberry (<italic>F. chiloensis</italic> and <italic>F. virginiana</italic>). Exogenous glycine-N, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>-N was supplied to the three species of strawberry. The domestic strawberry only took up a small portion of N from the amino acids, while the wild species took up significantly more glycine-N and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N. These results show that utilization of organic N in the form of proteins and amino acids can be species specific.</p><p>In the study reported here, cucumber exhibited the largest growth response from gelatin capsule treatments than the other crops evaluated in the study. However, the gelatin capsule treatments only increased plant growth in the above ground biomass: plant height, petiole length, total leaf area, and shoot dry weight (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). Different doses of gelatin capsules had no significant effect on root growth compared to non-treated controls (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). The lack of the biostimulant effect on root growth may be related to the source of the protein in gelatin or the concentration and type that was available in the growing medium.</p><p>Research has shown that both the protein source and concentration applied can influence root growth and development. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lucini et al. (2018)</xref> measured root growth promotion using a plant-based biostimulant that contained lateral root promoting peptides in melon (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic> L.). In their experiments, five rates (0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, and 0.48 mL per plant) of a biopolymer biostimulant were applied as a substrate drench. Total root dry matter, maximum root length, and root surface area in biostimulant treated plants were the greatest at 0.24 mL plant<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but decreased at 0.48 mL plant<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lonhienne et al. (2014)</xref> investigated externally supplied soluble proteins on root development of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and found that addition of low (1.6&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M) to intermediate (15&#x02013;23 &#x003bc;M) concentrations of bovine serum albumen (BSA) protein increased root dry weight, root length and thickness, and root hair length. However, root growth was inhibited at the high concentration of BSA (45 &#x003bc;M).</p><p>A linear relationship between the nitrogen supplied by the gelatin capsules and the nitrogen in cucumber tissue was observed (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). Thus the increase in nitrogen in the plant tissue was partially attributed to increased nitrogen supplied by the gelatin capsule treatments. However, the results suggest that growth promotion induced by the gelatin capsules was not caused by the N fertility alone as the treatment with two gelatin capsules had greater dry weight than the amino acid mix with the same proportion and amount of amino acids as the gelatin treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). To determine if the growth promotion by the gelatin capsules was caused by the fertilizer effect from the amino acids in the gelatin, urea was used as a treatment with the equivalent amount of N found in two gelatin capsules. Although urea has the potential to be phytotoxic, no adverse effect in these experiments measured as the growth response and nitrogen per plant were the same from the urea treatment and the amino acid mixture (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amirkhani et al. (2016)</xref> demonstrated that application of a plant protein to broccoli (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L.) seeds as a seed coating resulted in an unexpected increase in N uptake. Application of soy flour (a plant-based biostimulant source of nitrogen) as a component of a seed-coating blend increased N uptake efficiency. Nitrogen, from the soy flour applied in the seed coatings ranged from 0.024 to 0.073 mg per seed, while the enhanced nitrogen per plant ranged from 1.7 to 8.5 mg. Nitrogen applied in the seed coating only accounted for 1&#x02013;2% of the increased nitrogen in plants, indicating the soy flour acted as a biostimulant and not as a fertilizer.</p><p>The hydrolyzed collagens used in these experiments were grouped by molecular weight (<bold>Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref></bold>), and their distribution differs between gelatin types (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Gelatin hydrolysate had the smallest MWD with 100% of the elution in the low molecular weight fraction of &#x0003c;20 kDa (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). Gelatin capsules used in these experiments had an elution profile similar to granulated hydrolyzed collagen, which suggests that they are structurally similar. This speculation is supported by the plant dry weight results from the different hydrolyzed collagens that were evaluated. There were no significant differences in dry weight of cucumber between application of two gelatin capsules, and granulated hydrolyzed collagen (Bloom 220), while the dry weight for gelatin hydrolysate was significantly less than the Bloom 220 treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). One explanation for the difference in plant dry weight between the treatments may be the water solubility of the different hydrolyzed collagens. Both gelatin hydrolysate and the amino acid mix have a high water solubility. As the plants were watered in the greenhouse during the experiments, the treatments that were applied in dry powder form may have dissolved in the water and leached from the containers. The lower solubility collagens may have remained in the container for a longer period of time and thus available for plant growth resulting in a higher plant biomass. Additional research is warranted to investigate water solubility and duration of availability of the different treatments for plant uptake.</p><p>The underlying mechanism of plant growth enhancement in response to gelatin capsules remains unclear. Gelatin has a unique composition of amino acids, and is rich in proline and hydroxyproline (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>). <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Cusens (1973)</xref> showed that application of hydroxyproline enhanced root growth of peas. They proposed that externally supplied hydroxyproline enhanced root extension growth by affecting cell wall synthesis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan and Cusens, 1973</xref>). However, treatments with no proline and/or hydroxyproline were not significantly different than treatments with all amino acids (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>). Therefore, proline and hydroxyproline were not the primary amino acids responsible for the plant growth promotion from gelatin capsule treatments.</p><p>Protein hydrolysates have been shown to stimulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism and increase nitrogen assimilation in plants (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Schiavon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ertani et al., 2009</xref>). Nitrate reductase, NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase increased in maize following application of animal epithelial hydrolysate (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maini, 2006</xref>). Alfalfa protein hydrolysate applied to hydroponically grown maize increased the activity of malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase; as well as nitrogen metabolism enzymes, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT), and aspartate aminotransferase (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Schiavon et al., 2008</xref>). <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ertani et al. (2009)</xref> reported that both alfalfa protein hydrolysate and animal connective tissue hydrolysate stimulated plant growth, and also increased nitrate conversion into organic nitrogen by inducing nitrate reductase and GS activities. These results suggest that protein hydrolysates may enhance plant growth by up regulating nitrate assimilation metabolism (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ertani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Calvo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Colla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Rouphael et al., 2017</xref>). Research in our lab reported that gelatin capsule treatment increased expression of amino acid and nitrogen transporter genes that may be responsible for root nitrogen uptake enhancement. <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. (2015)</xref> compared non-treated cucumber seeds and gelatin treated cucumber seeds using RNA-seq data. Amino acid permease 3 (AAP3), an amino acid transporter, was upregulated with the gelatin capsule treatment. The AAP3 gene is preferentially expressed in the phloem and has been associated with long distance transport of basic amino acids such as arginine, histidine, and lysine. The increased expression of amino acid transporters AAP3 and amino acid permease 6 (AAP6) in the plants treated with gelatin capsules suggests that amino acid transport in the plants was positively enhanced by the gelatin treatment. Our results provide evidence that proteins of the hydrolyzed collagen present in gelatin capsules provided a sustained source of N and acted as a biostimulant. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved with the effect of gelatin on plant nutrition and growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>HW performed the experiments and wrote many parts of the article.
