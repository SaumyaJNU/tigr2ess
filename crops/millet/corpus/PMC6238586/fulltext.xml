growth and rescuing mitochondrial activity through CoA regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Like other tumors, aggressive soft tissue sarcomas (STS) use glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for growth. Given the importance of the cofactor coenzyme A (CoA) in energy metabolism, we investigated the impact of Vnn1 pantetheinase&#x02014;an enzyme that degrades pantetheine into pantothenate (vitamin B5, the CoA biosynthetic precursor) and cysyteamine&#x02014;on tumor growth. Using two models, we show that Vnn1<sup>+</sup> STS remain differentiated and grow slowly, and that in patients a detectable level of VNN1 expression in STS is associated with an improved prognosis. Increasing pantetheinase activity in aggressive tumors limits their growth. Using combined approaches, we demonstrate that Vnn1 permits restoration of CoA pools, thereby maintaining OXPHOS. The simultaneous production of cysteamine limits glycolysis and release of lactate, resulting in a partial inhibition of STS growth in vitro and in vivo. We propose that the Warburg effect observed in aggressive STS is reversed by induction of Vnn1 pantetheinase and the rewiring of cellular energy metabolism by its products.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aix Marseille University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gensollen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giessner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>INCA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">2008 - 045</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Equipes FRM 2014</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">DEQ20140329532</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>South African National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NetSARC, LYRIC (INCA-DGOS 4664), LYRICAN, EUROSARC (FP7-278742), and EURACAN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blay</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="sp6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canc&#x000e9;rop&#x000f4;le PACA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dieme</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Shintu</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor development requires a constant adaptation to environmental stress and involves metabolic rewiring (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fouad &#x00026; Aanei, 2017</xref>). Many tumors switch to aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to optimize cell fitness and growth under harsh and competitive growth conditions (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Vander Heiden, Cantley et al, 2009</xref>). Similarly, mitochondrial metabolites can be partly reoriented from energy production towards anabolism (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mullen et al, 2012</xref>). Uncoupling of the tricarboxylic acid cycle from OXPHOS limits reactive oxygen species production while preserving an efficient glycolytic flow. By limiting glucose oxidation, the Warburg effect contributes to anoikis resistance and metastasis (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al, 2015</xref>). These metabolic transitions provoke the release of metabolites that are exchanged between the tumor and cells in its environment. Lactate produced by glycolytic cells provides carbon to respiring tumor cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lisanti et al, 2013</xref>) and modulates macrophage polarization (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colegio et al, 2014</xref>). Competition for energy resources between nontumor and tumor cells is also exploited by cancers to escape immune responses (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al, 2015</xref>). Because cancerous cells can become addicted to new energy resources, targeting these indirect oncogenic pathways is becoming an attractive antitumor strategy (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Galluzzi et al, 2013</xref>). In addition, identification of regulators of metabolic transitions should provide biomarkers of tumor fitness and new metabolites with potential therapeutic interest.</p><p>We identified the Vnn1 pantetheinase activity as a key regulator of tissue tolerance to stress in various diseases (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pitari et al, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Naquet et al, 2014</xref>). This stress-inducible enzyme hydrolyzes pantetheine (PantSH) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Maras et al, 1999</xref>)&#x02014;a degradative product of coenzyme A (CoA)&#x02014;into pantothenate (vitamin B5) and cysteamine, a small aminothiol which posttranslationally modifies target proteins and impacts signaling (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Naquet et al, 2014</xref>). Although this enzyme activity plays a limited role under homeostatic conditions, its induction reflects a local adaptation to metabolic or oxidative stress as shown in the gut (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berruyer et al, 2006</xref>), liver (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rommelaere, Millet et al, 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">van Diepen et al, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al, 2016</xref>), and connective tissue (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dammanahalli et al, 2012</xref>), where it participates in healing processes.</p><p>Cancers are often viewed as never-healing wounds (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dvorak, 1986</xref>) and we anticipated that Vnn1 expression might be induced in some tumors and impact their progression through metabolic rewiring. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the <italic>vnn1</italic> gene deletion in p16<sup>Ink4A</sup>/p19<sup>Arf</sup>-deficient mice (p16/19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) which spontaneously develop various tumor types, including lymphomas, sarcomas, and carcinomas (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sharpless et al, 2002</xref>) and probed whether Vnn1 deficiency impacted the development of specific cancers and modulated their metabolic environment. By combining new genetic models with transcriptomic, metabolomic, and electron microscopy approaches, we identified the Vnn1 pantetheinase as a tumor suppressor for the development of aggressive soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Our results provide the first experimental evidence that the two products of pantetheinase activity exert complementary effects on the tumor, explaining the basis for Vnn1's suppression on tumor growth. Specifically, we demonstrate that pantothenate production restores CoA levels leading to an enhanced mitochondrial activity, whereas cysteamine reduces glycolysis and prevents the transition to the Warburg effect, a feature of the most aggressive tumors (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Casazza et al, 2014</xref>). Taken together, these results point to Vnn1 as a novel biomarker for STS prognosis, and it suggests a new route to regulate tumor growth rates through the modulation of CoA and cysteamine levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>Vnn1 deficiency favors soft tissue sarcoma development in p16/p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>To test the contribution of Vnn1 to spontaneous tumor development, we compared mouse survival and tumor incidence in three independent cohorts of p16/p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus p16/p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, derived from two independently derived crosses between p16/p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>, whereas 35% p16p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice progressively developed lethal tumors within 220 d, 70% p16p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> died of aggressive tumors before 220 d (<italic>P</italic> = 0.032). Based on the survival curves, we scored the presence of tumors at the date of sacrifice by macroscopic dissection and systematic anatomopathology of harvested organs for microscopic examination (200 d or earlier when premature death occurred). Results compiled in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicate that 53% p16p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and 65% p16p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> of the mice had developed tumors at autopsy. Whereas p16p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed various tumor types with a majority of lymphomas, p16/p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice predominantly developed skin STS typed as fibrosarcomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B</xref>). An anatomopathology analysis scored the degree of disorganization and anisonucleosis, the mitotic and necrotic indices and classified all STS tumors from differentiated (grade I) to undifferentiated (grade III). The differentiation grade of the available subcutaneous tumors was further investigated by quantifying the expression levels of collagen 1 and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>) which are conventional markers of mesenchymal cell differentiation. STS developing on the Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background were mostly grade II and III sarcomas. In the only case of skin STS (grade III) observed in Vnn1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, a low level of Vnn1 transcript was detected by qRT&#x02013;PCR (not shown), indicating that few cells express Vnn1 in the tumor mass. Of the three cohorts of mice tested, the few other sarcomas were only found in the liver or spleen in which Vnn1 can be expressed by various cell types. These results suggest that Vnn1 can be expressed in STS and may delay their development and/or growth. In favor of this hypothesis, an analysis of VNN1 transcriptional profile in a large array of human STS gathered in the Conticabase (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chibon et al, 2010</xref>) showed that undetectable level of VNN1 expression (observed in 198 of 349 sarcomas with complex genomics, 57%) is associated with increased risk of metastatic relapse in patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lack of Vnn1 is associated with the development of aggressive skin STS.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Survival curves of p16/p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (n = 30) versus p16/p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (n = 17) mice (Log rank test <italic>P</italic> = 0.032). <bold>(B)</bold> Anatomopathological typing after hematoxylin/eosin staining of tumor sections and distribution of spontaneously grown tumors in mice sacrificed at 200 d;

To bypass the senescence checkpoint, we derived myofibroblast lines obtained from p16/p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and p16/p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and selected those expressing comparable levels of type 1 collagen and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (not shown).

Although we could indefinitely expand these cell lines in vitro, they rarely developed into tumors after grafting them in immunodeficient nude mice. We therefore transformed the p16/p19/Vnn1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lines with an oncogenic Ras, coexpressed or not with mock (R), intact (VR), or catalytically deficient (VdR) Vnn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1B&#x02013;D</xref>).

The LC-MS analysis allows the detection of a larger number of metabolites grouped in pathways (i.e., choline or nucleotides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref> and Tables S2 and S3). This analysis indicates that various pathways are differentially affected by Vnn1 expression on VR versus R tumors and is consistent with R tumors displaying features of fast growth (nucleotides, choline pathway), glucose consumption, and reduced fatty acid disposal.</p><p>To link the metabolic shifts to transcriptional programs induced in the tumor mass, we performed a transcriptional profiling and high-throughput gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). This analysis distinguished R or VdR from VR tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>). Five generic signatures that were enriched in gene sets related to growth emerged from the GSEA analysis: (mTORC1), metabolism (glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and fatty acid metabolism), hypoxia, tissue organization (collagens), and inflammation (complement, inflammatory responses, IL-6, and IFN&#x003b3; signaling). The heat maps of selected leading edges are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3</xref>. R tumors highlighted signatures associated with intense proliferation such as glycolysis, mTORC1, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. In contrast, VR tumors showed a significant enrichment in genes associated with mesenchymal cell differentiation such as collagen production, a phenotype reminiscent of primary tumors observed in p16p19<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>, the expression of transcripts associated with hypoxic/glycolytic signatures (Glut1, Pdk1, Hk2, Adm, Bnip3, and Car9) was significantly enhanced in dissociated tumors (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). Glycolytic tumors are generally associated with fast growth. Because cysteamine and pantothenate are the two products of pantetheinase activity, they were added to in vitro cultures to test whether the Vnn1-mediated tumor suppressor effect could be recapitulated by its products alone or in combination. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, cysteamine reduced the growth of R cell lines in vitro by 50%. This effect was not modified by adding pantothenate at different concentrations to the culture medium.

It has been previously shown that pantethine, the oxidized (disulfide) form of PantSH, can be converted in vivo into cysteamine and pantothenate (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Wittwer et al, 1985</xref>) and has significant biological effects in infectious or inflammatory models (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Penet et al, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kavian et al, 2015</xref>).

Next, we set out to determine whether a minimal amount of pantetheinase activity within the tumor mass would potentiate the antitumor effect and be able to control the growth of aggressive R tumors. To test this hypothesis, we injected a mix of R/VR tumor cells at a 10/1 cell ratio in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and, additionally, administered pantethine. Interestingly, the presence of 10% VR cells in an R tumor reduces tumor growth, and this inhibitory effect is further enhanced by the addition of pantethine to mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>).

In this study, we provide the first experimental evidence that induction of Vnn1 pantetheinase activity in a mouse sarcoma model contributes to the regeneration of mitochondrial CoA stores through the production of pantothenate from PantSH, leading to enhanced mitochondrial fitness. Indeed, although R and VR cell lines show comparable mitochondrial organization, growth, and differentiation potential when grown in culture, we observed a disorganization of the mitochondrial/ER network in R but not VR tumors in vivo. These results show that the hostile environment of the tumor decompensates mitochondrial homeostasis if its CoA stores are not restored by local pantetheinase activity. Moreover, in vitro&#x02013;grown VR lines display a higher respiratory potential than R cell lines, in agreement with their ability to cope with metabolic stress. These results suggest that pantothenate availability determines mitochondrial fitness (thereby supporting ATP production) and that it is required for the fulfillment of effector functions observed in differentiated Vnn1+ tumors.</p><p>The results of this and several previous studies on the interplay between Vnn1 pantetheinase activity, CoA biosynthesis/degradation, and energy metabolism can be summarized schematically, providing a descriptive model that highlights the connections between the various systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). De novo CoA biosynthesis is initiated by the phosphorylation of pantothenate by pantothenate kinase (PanK), of which several isoforms with different subcellular locations and regulatory characteristics exist (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alfonso-Pecchio et al, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al, 2016</xref>). All human PanKs experience feedback inhibition by acetyl-CoA and other acyl-CoAs, especially long-chain acyl-CoAs such as palmitoyl-CoA (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al, 2016</xref>). This would suggest that PanKs would be inhibited when fatty acid pools are high. In the context of the current study, this correlates with the finding that fatty acids tend to accumulate in the fast-growing R cell lines that rather rely on glucose for energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>) and which also showed lowered CoA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of Vnn1-induced metabolic rewiring.</title><p>The Vnn1 pantetheinase induced in VR cell lines catalyzes the hydrolysis of PantSH to form pantothenate (Pan) and cysteamine (CEA-SH). The Pan enters the cell through the solute multivitamin transporter (SMVT) and is transformed into CoA by the CoA biosynthetic machinery: PanK1&#x003b2; or PanK3, PPCS, PPCDC, and a predicted monofunctional DPCK (DPCK<sub>m</sub>) in the cytosol, and PanK2, PPCS, PPCDC, and the bifunctional CoASy in the mitochondria (the subcellular location of PPCS and PPCDC remains to be confirmed, but independent studies have confirmed that both PanK2 and CoASy localizes to the mitochondria, the latter specifically to the matrix). The SLC25A42 transporter is predicted to link the cytosolic and mitochondrial dPCoA pools; however, its role in intracellular CoA and dPCoA transport is not yet fully understood. In R cell lines, fatty acid levels are increased, leading to the inhibition of the PanKs by acyl-CoAs and a reduction in CoA levels. In VR cells, fatty acid levels are lower, suggesting that they are shuttled to the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle, of which the first component is carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) that forms acylcarnitine in the intermembrane space, where it counteracts the inhibition of PanK2 by acyl-CoAs. The CEA-SH inhibits glycolysis and lactate (Lac) formation, leading to increased glucose (Glc) levels in VR cells; this induces the PanK4-DUF89 phosphatase that dephosphorylates P-PantSH and provides the PantSH used as substrate by Vnn1. The various possible sources of the cytosolic P-PantSH pool are shown and include cytosolic and mitochondrial biosynthesis, degradation by Nudix hydrolases and endonucleotide pyrophosphatases, and production from extracellular sources.

Importantly, the expression of the cytosolic PanK4 isoform can be induced by high levels of glucose in a rat model (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al, 2005</xref>). PanK4 has no actual PanK activity (because of point mutations of key active site residues) but was recently shown to have a DUF89 phosphatase domain that acts on 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheine (PPantSH) to release PantSH, the substrate of Vnn1 pantetheinase (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al, 2016</xref>). This would ensure supply of PantSH, which would have to exit the cell by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, for Vnn1 to act on. The Vnn1-produced pantothenate and cysteamine would then enter the cell again, with the latter causing the observed inhibition of glycolysis and lactate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>) that would further enhance the factors leading to the accumulation of glucose. The pantothenate would feed the CoA biosynthetic pathway in the mitochondria, which is both distinct from and regulated differently from the one operating in the cytosol. Particularly, the mitochondrial PanK2 isoform is activated by palmitoyl carnitine (and likely also other carnitines) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi et al, 2007</xref>), counteracting the inhibition by acyl-CoAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). Although the levels of acyl-carnitine levels were comparable between the various cell lines in this study (not shown), the lower fatty acid levels and increased oxygen consumption of the VR cell lines is indicative of active &#x003b2;-oxidation occurring. Taken together, this would support our conclusion that the expression of Vnn1 leads to a metabolic reorganization that improves mitochondrial fitness through the increase of CoA in mitochondrial stores.</p><p>An important question that remains relates to the source of the PPantSH that serves as substrate for the PanK4-DUF89 phosphatase, which then indirectly feeds the extracellular Vnn1 pantetheinase. Although the complexity and interdependence of the various systems make the unequivocal determination of the source of the Vnn1 substrate experimentally challenging, our current knowledge suggest several possibilities. The pool of intracellular PPantSH is produced by several reactions: biosynthetically by the action of phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS) and decarboxylase (PPCDC) on 4&#x02032;-phosphopantothenate (PPan), the product of PanK, or through degradation of CoA by Nudix hydrolases (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Strauss, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). However, both these sources are unlikely, as using PPantSH in this manner would result in a futile cycle of biosynthesis and degradation.</p><p>Recent findings have suggested that the cytosolic and mitochondrial CoA pools are formed and maintained distinctly (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Pietrocola et al, 2015</xref>). Specifically, mitochondrial CoA is formed from PPantSH by the CoA synthase (CoASy)&#x02014;a bifunctional protein with both phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK) activities&#x02014;that has been shown by two independent studies to be localized in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rhee et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dusi et al, 2014</xref>). In contrast, CoA in the cytosol of Drosophila has been proposed to be derived from a separate predicted monofunctional DPCK (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Vozza et al, 2017</xref>) acting on mitochondrial dephospho-CoA (dPCoA) exported by the SLC25A42 transporter (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fiermonte et al, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). Although it is not yet certain if the latter also occurs in humans and the proposed strict subcellular compartmentalization of the CoA pools needs further experimental verification, the model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref> would provide a mechanism whereby cytosolic PPantSH is able to feed Vnn1, while still allowing for mitochondrial CoA pools to be maintained.</p><p>However, it is more likely that the PPantSH that indirectly supplies Vnn1 is obtained from extracellular sources. Specifically, endonucleotide pyrophosphatases degrade extracellular CoA to form PPantSH, whereas there is some evidence that it is also excreted by certain bacteria (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jackowski &#x00026; Rock, 1984</xref>). Coupled with the recent finding that extracellular PPantSH is relatively stable and is able to cross cell membranes in an unassisted manner (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Srinivasan et al, 2015</xref>), this suggests that the microbiome could be a significant source of PPantSH. Such a conclusion would be in agreement with recent studies that highlighted the metabolic consequences of the close association of tumor and microbial cells (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bullman et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Geller et al, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cysteamine released by Vnn1 pantetheinase limits glycolysis and lactate formation, antagonizing the Warburg effect and thereby limiting cell growth while enhancing tumor cell differentiation and innate immune cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>). It has long been known that sufficient ATP levels antagonize the rate-limiting phosphofructokinase-dependent step of glycolysis. Cysteamine, in redox equilibrium with cystamine (its disulfide), has been proposed to regulate biological functions through formation of mixed disulfides with enzymes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Naquet et al, 2014</xref>) or amino acids favoring the conversion of cystine into cysteine in cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Elmonem et al, 2016</xref>). More specifically, it was shown using recombinant proteins that the catalytic activity of four glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase) was reversibly inhibited by cystamine thiolation, whereas the same process activated the neoglucogenic 1,6-bisphosphatase (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Terada et al, 1994</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that cystamine could moderate glycolysis while favoring neoglucogenesis, synergizing with the ATP-mediated inhibition of glycolysis and further contributing to the reduction of the Warburg effect (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al, 2015</xref>). Indirect regulation, for example, through the effect of cysteamine on transcriptional regulators, should therefore also be studied.</p><p>Taken together, the combination of the cysteamine and pantothenate-mediated effects is able to explain the rewiring imposed by Vnn1 expression on tumors, a process that cannot be recapitulated by the individual metabolites. In the STS model, lack of Vnn1 leads to the development of undifferentiated aggressive glycolytic tumors. These metabolic transitions are controlled by local cues and oncogenic drivers. It was shown that titrating the amount of Kras copy number defines metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic susceptibility (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kerr et al, 2016</xref>). This suggests that tumor cells calibrate their response to quantitative variations of cell-intrinsic or external factors and remain susceptible to modulation. Antagonizing the Warburg effect is, therefore, an attractive strategy to limit tumor growth, as documented by the impact of the metastasis suppressor KISS1 gene that enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al, 2013</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by regulating the level of pantetheinase activity in tumors, therefore representing a new strategy to skew the tumor metabolic profile and limit its growth potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s11"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> (p16/p19)-deficient mice were obtained from AM Schmitt-Verhulst (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Huijbers et al, 2006</xref>).

The samples were sonicated for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C (10 cycles of 30 s ON/30 s OFF) to complete tissue lysis and metabolite extraction. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant (about 700 &#x003bc;l) was then filtered by centrifugation through Nanosep 3K membrane filtration tubes for 10 min at 10,000 <italic>g</italic>. 223 &#x003bc;l of the filtered extract was neutralized with 70 &#x003bc;l Tris buffer (500 mM, pH 7.6) and 328.1 &#x003bc;l of water. The disulfides were reduced by addition of 47.3 &#x003bc;l of 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. After 10 min, 31.5 &#x003bc;l of <italic>N</italic>-[4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)phenyl]maleimide (10 mM in 100% ACN) was added to bring the total volume to 700 &#x003bc;l. The samples were subsequently lyophilized before shipment for analysis; upon arrival, lyophilized samples were reconstituted in 50% aqueous ACN before HPLC analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Biological resources are structured by the clinical departments in various databases</title><p>Conticabase tumor bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://conticabase.org">conticabase.org</ext-link>) for soft tissue and visceral sarcoma includes n = 15,808 samples with clinical annotations and follow-up (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://conticabase.sarcomabcb.org/">https://conticabase.sarcomabcb.org/</ext-link>).
