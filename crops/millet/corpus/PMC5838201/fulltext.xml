</p><sec id="Sec4"><title><bold>Preface</bold></title><p id="Par6">Management of diabetes, a disease which is assuming epidemic proportions, remains a challenge despite the availability of numerous guidelines. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2015 estimates, globally 415 million people are suffering from diabetes and this figure may reach up to 642 million in 2040 [1]. Currently, 78.3 million people with diabetes are in Southeast Asia (SEA) region and this may rise up to 140.2 million in 2040 if proper measures are not taken [1]. India has the second largest population (69.2 million) with diabetes in the world after China (109.7 million) [2]. In addition, approximately 52% adults with diabetes remain undiagnosed in India. Large-scale surveys, such as District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS) 2012&#x02013;2013 and Annual Health Survey (AHS) 2014, have reported that around 7% Indian adults are suffering from diabetes and the prevalence is higher in urban (9.8%) compared to rural areas (5.7%) [3].</p><p id="Par7">Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal insulin secretion and utilization. Indian patients with T2DM have distinctive clinical and biochemical characteristics, which makes them the so-called Asian Indian Phenotype [4&#x02013;7]. These abnormalities include more insulin resistance (IR), elevated abdominal adiposity (i.e., higher visceral fat in spite of lower body mass index [BMI]), lower level of adiponectin, and a higher level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein [4&#x02013;7]. Moreover, they have greater propensity to develop cardiovascular (CV) complications such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis at any age point [4, 8] and have significant pro-coagulant affinities [9&#x02013;11]. At the same BMI, more Asian Indians develop metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes compared to their western counterparts [12]. In spite of a relatively lower rate of obesity as defined by international BMI cut-off points, Indians tend to have larger waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR), indicating a greater degree of central body obesity [13]. Asian Indians also have increased metabolic risk compared to their western counterparts due to high leptin levels [14], greater IR [6, 15, 16], higher insulin sensitivity index and lower acute insulin response to glucose [17], early loss of &#x003b2;-cell function [6], &#x0201c;concept of thin-fat Indian,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;sarcopenic obesity&#x0201d; [18].</p><p id="Par8">Numerous international and national guidelines are in place for the management of T2DM. Adopting country-specific guidelines improves treatment outcomes in diabetes. The Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI) therefore published the clinical practice recommendations for the management of T2DM in 2015, which was adapted from the 2014 global guidelines for type 2 diabetes by IDF. The recommendations were specifically designed considering the diverse socioeconomic and cultural background of Indians. The 2015 RSSDI guidelines were very well accepted by the healthcare practitioners across India and helped in decision-making.</p><p id="Par9">However, diabetes research is continuously evolving. Every year, several publications are being added to the literature which can significantly impact holistic diabetes care. Addition of new medicines to the diabetes management armamentarium, which is beneficial in terms of reduction in morbidity and mortality risk, is transforming the treatment of T2DM. Keeping this in mind, in the 2017 update, all of the sections have been updated with recent evidence. Moreover, three new sections, Hypoglycemia, Diabetes and CV risk, and Technologies, have been incorporated and some of the annexures revised. The objective of this updated RSSDI 2017 clinical practice recommendations is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with T2DM. It is expected that these recommendations will help define practically implementable best practices not only for the management of T2DM but also help in timely prevention of acute and chronic complications of diabetes by primary care physicians across India.</p><p id="Par16">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><bold>Methodology</bold></title><p id="Par35">The methodology followed to develop the current recommendations is similar to that used to prepare RSSDI 2015 recommendations. A steering committee of RSSDI involving experienced diabetologists and endocrinologists across India was constituted, which met twice in the year 2017. The steering committee deliberated and defined the scope of the recommendations. As in the case of 2015 version, for all sections of the recommendations, expert panel groups were constituted including one steering committee member as a coordinator with several national experts to review all available Indian, Asian, and global evidence and make suitable recommendations.</p><p id="Par36">The members of the expert panel reviewed the previous RSSDI recommendations and formulated recommendations based on available research evidence and economic and logistic constraints prevalent in India. Where there was little or no evidence, the group relied on their clinical experience and expertise, judgment, and consensus to make the recommendations. The recommendations of the expert panel groups were reviewed by the steering committee and were then finalized by the writing group as a draft consensus document.</p><p id="Par37">The decision on the analytical reevaluation of the recommendations proposed by RSSDI 2017 was based on the Indian evidence published between 1990 and 2017 and following a review of relevant local factors in the Indian context. This included Indian evidence from indexed literature searches, articles published in the <italic>International Journal of Diabetes in Developing</italic> Countries (IJDDC), <italic>RSSDI Textbook of Diabetes</italic> (third edition) [1, 2], <italic>Journal of Association of Physicians of India</italic> (JAPI), and personal communications from authors. Where Indian evidence was not available, Asian/global evidence was considered where available.</p><p id="Par38">Similar to the 2015 document, only &#x0201c;Recommended care&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Limited care&#x0201d; setting of the IDF guidelines have been considered while the &#x0201c;Comprehensive care&#x0201d; was omitted. This practical approach facilitates implementation of cost-effective evidence-based care in limited resource settings like India.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39"><italic>Recommended care</italic> constitutes evidence-based care which is cost-effective. Interventions should be made available to all people with diabetes with an aim of any healthcare system to achieve this level of care.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40"><italic>Limited care</italic> is the lowest level of care that seeks to achieve the major objectives of diabetes management provided in healthcare settings with very limited resources such as drugs, personnel, technologies, and procedures.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par41">

The optimal cut-off value of A1C to diagnose diabetes is determined in a way that individuals with A1C levels above a certain cut-off value have a much larger probability of having or developing diabetes-related complications [4]. However, in several countries including India, there is no consensus on a suitable cut-off point of A1C for diagnosis of diabetes. Moreover, measuring A1C is more expensive than FPG [5] and standardization of measurement techniques and laboratories is poorly practiced across the country [6]. Nonetheless, a recent review has included A1C as a criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes in India [7]. In lieu of this, the panel felt that using A1C as sole criteria for diagnosis of diabetes is inappropriate in resource constraint settings and framing recommendations based on fasting or 2-h plasma glucose or OGTT to detect or diagnose diabetes would be more appropriate in limited resource settings like India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par64">The decision about setting diagnostic thresholds values was based on the cost-effective strategies for diagnosing diabetes that were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar1"><title><italic>A1C cut-off for diagnosis of diabetes in Indian patients</italic></title><p id="Par65">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par66">The panel opined that A1C cut-off point of 6.5% is optimal for the diagnosis of diabetes in Indian patients. This was based on the data available from four centers in India: Chandigarh, Chennai, Bangalore, and Andhra Pradesh. Data from a community-based randomized cross-sectional study in urban Chandigarh suggest that A1C cut point of 6.5% has optimal specificity of 88%, while cut-off point of 7.0% has sensitivity of 92% for the diagnosis of diabetes [8]. On the other hand, data from Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES) demonstrated 88.0% sensitivity and 87.9% specificity for detection of diabetes when A1C cut-off point is 6.1% (based on 2-h postload plasma glucose) and 93.3% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity when A1C cut-off point is 6.4% (when diabetes was defined as FPG &#x02265;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/l) [1]. Furthermore, <italic>Mohan et al.</italic> derived and validated the A1C cut-off value of &#x0003e;&#x02009;6.3% in the ethnic population of Rayalaseema area of Andhra Pradesh state. Study reports that there is no significant difference in the training and validation data set and concludes that A1C &#x0003e;&#x02009;6.3% appeared to be the optimal cut-off value for the diagnosis of T2DM [9].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67">The panel opined that A1C cannot be used as &#x0201c;sole&#x0201d; measurement for the diagnosis of diabetes in Indian settings.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par123">Chronic hyperglycemia is associated with significantly higher risk of developing diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular complications. Early detection of diabetes/prediabetes through screening increases the likelihood of identifying asymptomatic individuals and provides adequate treatment to reduce the burden of diabetes and its complications. Through a computer-simulated model on the data from the Anglo-Danish-Dutch study of intensive treatment in people with screen-detected diabetes in primary care (ADDITION-Europe), <italic>Herman et al.</italic> have demonstrated that the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and relative risk reduction (RRR) for CV outcomes are substantially higher at 5&#x000a0;years with early screening and diagnosis of diabetes when compared to 3&#x000a0;years (3.3% ARR, 29% RRR) or 6&#x000a0;years of delay (4.9% ARR, 38% RRR) [1]. Adopting a targeted approach and utilizing low-cost tools with meticulous planning and judicious allocation of resources can make screening cost-effective even in resource-constrained settings like India [2]. Furthermore, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, screening for T2DM and prediabetes is found to be cost-effective when initiated at around 45&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years of age with repeated testing every 5&#x000a0;years [3].</p><p id="Par124">Prediabetes is defined as blood glucose concentration higher than normal but lower than established thresholds for diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are defined by having IGT (2-h plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT&#x02009;=&#x02009;140 to 199&#x000a0;mg/dL) or IFG (FPG&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 to 125&#x000a0;mg/dL). It is a state of intermediate hyperglycemia with increased risk of developing diabetes and associated CV complications and therefore early detection and treatment of prediabetic IGT and IFG is necessary to prevent the rising epidemic of diabetes and its associated morbidity and mortality. Although IDF guideline does not deal with screening and management of prediabetes, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for prediabetes and T2DM through informal assessment of risk factors or with an assessment tool guidelines [4]. Given the high prevalence rates of prediabetes in our country, RSSDI panel members opine that including screening and management aspects of prediabetes is logical and will provide an important opportunity for prevention of diabetes in India.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par125">The decision about conducting a screening program should be based on the following local factors than were reviewed in Indian context: limited resources, lack of quality assurance in labs, high-risk population for diabetes, large unrecognized burden of undiagnosed diabetes, high prevalence of prediabetes, among fastest converting population form prediabetes to diabetes, large rural&#x02013;urban divide, largely sedentary population in urban areas, onset of T2DM at least a decade earlier that in western countries, newer technologies for screening, cost of early detection to the individual, capacity for carrying out screening, and capacity to treat/manage screen positive individuals with diabetes and prediabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title><bold>Rationale</bold></title><sec id="FPar2"><title><italic>Opportunistic screening</italic></title><p id="Par126">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par127">The panel opine that screening should be opportunistic but not community based as they are less effective outside healthcare setting and poorly targeted, i.e., it may fail to identify individuals who are at risk. In a cross-sectional study on 215 participants in a tertiary care hospital in Haryana, opportunistic screening showed that for every seven patients with known diabetes there are four undiagnosed diabetes patients [5]. Opportunistic screening is more cost-effective with better feasibility within the healthcare system while minimizing the danger of medicalization of a situation. Furthermore, patients diagnosed through opportunity screening have good prognosis over those diagnosed by clinical onset of symptoms [6]. However, community screening may be carried out wherever feasible.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par128">The panel suggest opportunistic screening in:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par129">Individuals presenting to healthcare settings for unrelated illness</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par130">Adult family members of patients with diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par131">Antenatal care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par132">People over the age of 30&#x000a0;years should be encouraged for voluntary testing for diabetes</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list>

The latter is a simple one with few risk variables listed and can be applied at any work site by the paramedical personnel. Both risk scores are validated and are being used widely in our country. The Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) tool has been found to be useful for identifying undiagnosed subjects with diabetes in India and could make screening programs more cost-effective [8]. It is also used in several national programs for prevention of not only diabetes but also cardiometabolic diseases such as stroke. Also its applicability in identifying prevalence of diabetes-related complications such as CAD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and neuropathy among T2DM patients has been found to be successful [9].</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par136">The panel endorse the IDF recommendation on the need to measure FPG and perform OGTT based on random plasma glucose levels which are associated with the development of diabetes (2&#x000a0;h plasma glucose &#x02265;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;mg/dL) or prediabetes (2&#x000a0;h plasma glucose &#x02265;&#x02009;140 to &#x0003c;200&#x000a0;mg/dL) [10]. According to IDF guidelines, FPG values &#x02264;100&#x000a0;mg/dL are considered normal. Anything above 100&#x000a0;mg/dL is considered to be at risk of developing diabetes. Moreover, people with FPG levels between 100 and 125&#x000a0;mg/dL have IFG, suggesting an increased risk of developing T2DM. Confirming the FPG levels &#x02265;&#x02009;126&#x000a0;mg/dL by repeating the test on another day, indicates that a person has diabetes [11]. In a cross-sectional study on 13,792 non-fasting National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) participants without diagnosed diabetes, random blood sugar level of &#x02265;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg/dL was strongly associated with undiagnosed diabetes [12]. In addition, prediction of diabetes carried out on the basis of this data showed that random blood glucose &#x02265;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg/dL was 81.6% (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;74.9%, 88.4%) sensitive and 78% (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;76.6%, 79.5%) specific to detect undiagnosed diabetes, which is better than current screening guidelines [13]. In patients with no history of diabetes or prediabetes, random blood glucose screening is effective in promoting additional screening among high-risk age groups and encourages subjects to make lifestyle changes [14].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par137">The panel opine that although the present criteria of IFG (100 to 125&#x000a0;mg/dL) may be sensitive and has lesser variability, measuring 2-h plasma glucose levels may give more accuracy and confidence in targeting this population for prevention strategies.</p></list-item></list>

Moreover, the use of ADA recommended A1C threshold value of 6.5% for diagnosis of diabetes may result in significant underdiagnosis [16]. The predictive value of A1C for T2DM depends on various factors such as ethnicity, age, and presence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [17&#x02013;20]. In a cohort study on individuals from Swedish and Middle-East ancestry, A1C &#x02265;&#x02009;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol had a predictive sensitivity of 31 and 25%, respectively, for T2DM [18]. Furthermore, A1C values &#x02265;&#x02009;42 and &#x02265;&#x02009;39&#x000a0;mmol/mol as predictors for prediabetes were associated with a sensitivity of 15 and 34% in individuals of Swedish and 17 and 36% in individuals of Middle-East ancestry. Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies including 49,238 individuals without T2DM reveal that A1C values are higher in Blacks (0.26% (2.8&#x000a0;mmol/mol), <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), Asians (0.24% (2.6&#x000a0;mmol/mol), <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and Latinos (0.08% (0.9&#x000a0;mmol/mol); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) when compared to Whites [20].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title><bold>Evidence</bold></title><p id="Par159">It has been observed that Indians are more prone to diabetes at a younger age and at a lower BMI compared to their western counterparts [21, 22]. The reason for this difference has been attributed to &#x0201c;Asian Indian phenotype&#x0201d; characterized by low BMI, higher body fat, visceral fat and WC, lower skeletal muscle mass, and profoundly higher rates of IR [23, 24]. The 10-year follow-up data of the CURES that assessed incident rates of dysglycemia in Asian Indians are now available [25]. According to the study, Asian Indians were found to have one of the highest incidence rates of diabetes (diabetes, prediabetes, and any dysglycemia&#x02009;=&#x02009;22.2, 29.5, and 51.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively), with rapid conversion from normoglycemia to dysglycemia (45.1%). In a cross-sectional study on slum dwellers in Bangalore, prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was identified as 12.33 and 11.57% in people aged 35&#x000a0;years or above [26]. Moreover, female gender, increasing age, overweight and obesity, sedentary lifestyle, tobacco consumption, and diet habits were strongly associated with prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes. Similarly, in a cross-sectional study in Tamil Nadu, prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was identified as 10.1 and 8.5%, respectively [27]. Risk factors associated with prediabetes in this study were age of 40&#x000a0;years, male gender, BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;23&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, WHR for men &#x0003e;&#x02009;1 and women &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.8, alcohol intake, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x0003e;&#x02009;140&#x000a0;mmHg. Likewise, in a household survey in Punjab using World Health Organization STEP wise Surveillance (WHO STEPS) questionnaire, prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was identified as 8.3 and 6.3%, respectively [28]. Risk factors that were significantly associated with diabetes were age (45&#x02013;69&#x000a0;years), marital status, hypertension, obesity, and family history of diabetes. A study on 163 north Indian subjects proposed severity of IR and family history of diabetes as determinants of diminished beta-cell function leading to diabetes in MS [29]. Predictors of progression to dysglycemia were advancing age, family history of diabetes, 2-h plasma glucose, A1C, low and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and physical inactivity. Despite the escalating burden, the current evidence on the prevention of T2DM and its complications in India still remain scanty. Though the general practitioners in India are well aware of symptoms and complications of T2DM, they are oblivious regarding the use of standard screening tests resulting in significant delay in diagnosis and treatment [30]. Considering significant resource constraints together with awareness levels of patients and physicians, there is a need for prevention strategies that are culturally relevant and cost-effective [31]. Following section covers evidence from India studies on various strategies that are helpful in detecting and minimizing the risk of development of diabetes and its associated complications.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par160">Simplified tools for detection of diabetes such as IDRS developed by MDRF and Diabetes Risk Score for Asian Indians devised by Prof. A. Ramachandran are found to be useful for identifying undiagnosed patients with diabetes in India. Use of these tools could make screening programs more cost-effective [7, 8]. Studies from different regions of India including Jammu and Kashmir, Chennai, Haryana, Delhi, Jabalpur, and Kerala estimated the utility of MDRF-IDRS in identifying risk for diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes in Indian adult population and found statistically significant association between IDRS and DM patients indicating MDRF-IDRS to be efficient tool to screen and diagnose the huge pool of undiagnosed diabetics in India [33&#x02013;37].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par161">Other novel non-invasive screening tools such as EZSCAN for detection of prediabetes, diabetes, and microvascular complications [38&#x02013;40], EZSCAN and SUDOSCAN for chronic kidney diseases (CKD) [41, 42], pedobarography and SUDOSCAN for diabetic peripheral neuropathy [43&#x02013;47], Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI), and Optimal Scaling Combination (OSC) for diabetic foot problems [48] have also been evaluated in Asian population with T2DM. However, there are a lot of false positive and false negative results with these non-invasive screening tools and currently the panel does not recommend using these tools for diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes, in the absence of the gold standard tests based on blood glucose testing outlined above.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par162">It is also found by some researchers that identifying the presence of multiple risk factors could be used as a simple measure of identifying people at high risk of diabetes [49].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par163">The panel suggest that individuals with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes should be advised on lifestyle changes and implementing strategies focusing on diet, exercise, and weight loss to prevent the risk of progression and thus complications of diabetes [50].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par164">Several landmark studies have shown that lifestyle intervention could prevent the progression to T2DM by about 30&#x02013;60% [51]. Evidence from literature suggests that initial lifestyle interventions are cost-effective [52] and can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes in Asian Indians with IGT or with combined IGT + IFG [53, 54]. In patients in whom metformin is contraindicated, AGIs such as acarbose or voglibose may be used, as they confer lesser side effects compared to other OADs. Furthermore, lifestyle intervention with diet and exercise in those with IGT can significantly decrease the incidence of diabetes and its complications [55, 56] while providing long-term beneficial effects for up to 20&#x000a0;years [57]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 50 trials identified that lifestyle intervention reduced risk of progression to diabetes by 36% over 6&#x000a0;months to 6&#x000a0;years which attenuated to 20% by the time of follow-up results of the trials were measured [15]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis show that physical activity in prediabetes subjects improves oral glucose tolerance, FPG and A1C levels, and maximum oxygen uptake and body composition [58]. Results indicate that physical activity promotion and participation slow down the progression of disease and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with T2DM. Optimal sleep (7&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h per night) has been shown to maintain metabolic health, aid in weight loss, and increase insulin sensitivity, while short duration (&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h) or longer duration (&#x0003e;&#x02009;8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h) of sleep was associated with increased risk of diabetes [59, 60]. Similar results were observed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 articles which determined that the pooled relative risks for T2DM were 1.09 (95% CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.04, 1.15) for each 1-h shorter sleep duration among individuals who slept &#x0003c;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;h/day and 1.14 (1.03, 1.26) for each 1&#x000a0;h increment of sleep duration among individuals who slept longer, when compared to 7-h sleep duration per day [61].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par165">Interventions predominantly based on counselling and education are found to be effective in preventing/reducing the risk of developing diabetes and its complication and also helps in improving dietary patterns of individuals with prediabetes and diabetes [31, 62]. Mobile phone messaging was found to be an inexpensive and most effective alternative way to deliver educational and motivational advice and support towards lifestyle modification in high-risk individuals [63].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par166">Dietary interventions such as high-carbohydrate low-fat diet [64], fiber-rich [65], and protein-rich diet [66, 67] were found to have definite role in prevention of diabetes. Furthermore, components of whole grains, and fruit and green leafy vegetables such as cereal fiber and magnesium, are consistently associated with lower risk of developing T2DM&#x000a0;[68].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par167">Evidence from the CURES and Prevention Awareness Counselling and Evaluation (PACE) diabetes project suggests that awareness and knowledge regarding diabetes is inadequate among patients in India and implementation of educational programs at massive level can greatly improve the awareness on diabetes and its associated CVD [69, 70]. Moreover, mass awareness and screening programs through community empowerment were found to effectively prevent and control diabetes and its complications such as foot amputations [71].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par168">Currently, the role of yoga and fenugreek in the prevention of diabetes is being evaluated in the Indian prevention of Diabetes Study by RSSDI.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title><bold>Implementation</bold></title><p id="Par169">A clear and transparent decision should be made about whether or not to endorse a screening strategy.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par266">Obesity is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder that is often associated with T2DM [1, 2]. Obesity is clinically defined as a BMI of &#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (a BMI of 30 represents an overweight of approximately 30&#x000a0;lb. (14&#x000a0;kg) for any given height) [3]. However, WHO and International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) suggested BMI cut-offs of 23 and 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for Asian Indian adults for overweight and obesity, respectively [4, 5]. Furthermore, the guidelines defined generalized obesity (GO, BMI &#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), AO (WC &#x02265;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;cm for men and &#x02265;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;cm for women), and combined obesity (CO, GO plus AO) for Asian population [5]. In India, the prevalence of obesity is rising at an alarming rate, especially affecting urban population [2, 6]. The Indian Council of Medical Research-INdia DIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study currently report that 135, 153, and 107 million individuals in India will have GO, AO, and CO, respectively, in extrapolation to the whole country. Furthermore, female gender, hypertension, diabetes, higher socioeconomic status, physical inactivity, and urban residence were significantly associated with GO, AO, and CO, in Indian populations [7]. Indians are at increased predisposition to diabetes that has been attributed to the &#x0201c;Asian Indian Phenotype&#x0201d; characterized by lesser GO as measured by BMI and greater central body obesity and more truncal fat as shown by greater WC and WHR [2, 8&#x02013;11]. High AO contributes significantly to metabolic alterations such as IR, dysglycemia, and dyslipidemia [12&#x02013;16, 17]. Obesity-induced IR may cause T2DM by increasing the allostatic load on the pancreas which eventually leads to failure of pancreas. High consumption of sugars among children and adults in India may also have clinical significance in view of the high tendency for Indians to develop IR, abdominal adiposity, and hepatic steatosis and the increasing &#x0201c;epidemic&#x0201d; of T2DM [2, 18]. Because Asian Indians tend to develop diabetes at a significantly lower BMI and WC than white Europeans, lower thresholds of BMI to define overweight (BMI&#x02009;=&#x02009;23&#x02013;24.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obesity (BMI &#x02265;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were proposed by IDF and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [19, 20].</p><p id="Par267">In light of increasing prevalence of obesity in both developed and developing countries and a higher risk for developing IR, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and a higher CV risk at lower levels of BMI in Indians, a consensus meeting was convened in New Delhi in 2008 (published in 2009) to redefine the cut-offs for BMI and WC for diagnosing overweight and obesity in Indian population [21, 22]. According to this consensus statement, a BMI of 18&#x02013;22.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> should be considered as normal, a BMI of 23&#x02013;24.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> should be considered as overweight, and BMI more than 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> indicates presence of obesity. The upper limit for WC for men and women was defined as 90&#x000a0;cm and 80&#x000a0;cm, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par268">The following local factors were considered when framing recommendations for obesity that were reviewed in Indian context: high prevalence of obesity, high abdominal adiposity, increased fasting insulin and IR, nutritional factors, and atherogenic lipid profile [increased triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (LDL) and low HDL].</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar9"><title><italic>Identification</italic></title><p id="Par269">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par270">Indian Diabetes Risk Score is a simple technique for screening of diabetes, which uses four risk factors: age, AO, family history of diabetes, and physical activity. Several studies have highlighted the importance of IDRS in the screening of diabetes in Indian population [23&#x02013;26]. In a cross-sectional study comparison of IDRS and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) by obesity and lipid abnormality status in women of Asian Indian origin hinted that IDRS can predict CV and diabetes risk more effectively than FRS and serve as simple and cost-effective tool for a primary care physician to identify at risk individuals for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [27].</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="FPar10"><title><italic>Lifestyle intervention: behavioral therapy, exercise, and therapy</italic></title><p id="Par271">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par272">Lifestyle interventions including diet therapy, physical activity, and behavioral and psychosocial strategies have shown positive health outcomes in obese T2DM patients [28]. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) [29] and the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial [30] report clinically significant weight losses averaging 4 to 5% (or 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;kg) at 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including Asian Indians report that lifestyle intervention with less education lost a model-predicted 3.30&#x000a0;kg more in weight and 4.95&#x000a0;cm more in WC than those with more formal education [31]. Moreover, a population-based cross-sectional study with 15,145 participants report that an additive interaction exists between poor sleep quality, AO, and family history of diabetes in relation to IFG [32].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par273">The diet therapy for obese T2DM patients should be based on the criteria of decreased energy intake and increased energy expenditure to produce the negative energy balance. This includes low-calorie diet and diet with caloric restriction and with varying combination of macronutrients [33].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par274">Behavioral therapy includes modifiable factors such as eating patterns and exercise habits that can have significant impact on the management of obesity. A review in Indian scenario suggested that slow eating techniques along with stimulus control (not distracted by television, books, or other materials) have positive effect on weight loss [33]. In obese T2DM patients, IDF recommends to maintain healthy lifestyle through behavioral therapy that includes moderate calorie restriction to promote weight loss (5&#x02013;10% loss of body weight in the first year) [34], moderate increase in physical activity, and change in dietary composition. Other important components of behavioral therapy embrace self-monitoring, goal setting, and stimulus or cue control. Such strategies help in setting up realistic goals, guide patients in identifying stimulus that lead to excessive nutrient intake, and eliminate them accordingly [35].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par275">A recent systematic review and meta-analysis report that diet and physical exercise resulted in significant improvement of body weight in south Asian adults but had no effect on BMI and WC. Furthermore, no alteration in these parameters was observed in south Asian children [36].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par276">Body weight has been shown to be inversely associated with physical activity [37]. Subjects with low physical activity have threefold greater risk of major weight gain in men and almost a fourfold in women [38, 39]. Moreover, this association was stronger for women than for men and for obese compared to normal weight or overweight individuals [40]. Furthermore, slow and prolonged exercise is associated with fatty acid oxidation with beneficial effects on body weight [41, 42]. RCT comprising 262 sedentary men and women report that the combination of aerobic and resistance training exercise reduced WC from &#x02212;&#x02009;1.9 to &#x02212;&#x02009;2.8&#x000a0;cm and mean fat mass of &#x02212;&#x02009;1.7 (&#x02212;&#x02009;2.3 to &#x02212;&#x02009;1.1&#x000a0;kg; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) compared with the non-exercise group [43].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par277">Therefore, the panel opined that prescribing a combination of aerobic and resistance training exercises in individuals with T2DM can improve metabolic control while reducing obesity and its related complications.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par279">Though lifestyle modifications are effective in preventing diabetes relapse or remission [44], they often fail requiring initiation of pharmacotherapy. Metformin is the first choice drug with some evidence for weight loss [45, 46]. The DPP and Indian Diabetes Prevention Program (IDPP) trial report that metformin and lifestyle intervention greatly reduce the risk of T2DM in overweight or obese patients [47, 48]. Use of GLP-1 analogues [49], SGLT-2 inhibitors [50, 51], and to some extent DPP-4 inhibitors [52, 53] has been shown to induce weight loss and should be considered as add-on to metformin in obese T2DM patients. Furthermore, GLOBE study report that fixed dose combination (FDC) of acarbose/metformin in Indian T2DM patients was associated with significant reduction in body weight (&#x02212;&#x02009;1.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2&#x000a0;kg compared to control (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001)) [54].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par280">Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin), a lipase inhibitor, is the only approved agent for weight loss in India. It causes modest weight loss by blocking fat absorption from gut and when used in combination with lifestyle changes was found to be effective in prevention of diabetes [10, 55]. Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis report that treatment with orlistat and lifestyle intervention resulted in significantly greater weight loss (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and improved glycemic control (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) in overweight and obese T2DM patients compared with lifestyle intervention alone [56].</p></list-item></list>

Evidence from several studies suggests that bariatric surgery provides durable glycemic control compared with intensive medical therapy [57&#x02013;60]. Moreover, gastric bypass has been observed to uniquely restore the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function and reduce truncal fat, thus reversing the core defects in diabetes [57]. In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs report that RYGB surgery is superior to medical treatment for short- to medium-term remission of T2DM and improvement of metabolic condition and CV risk factors [61].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par284">Bariatric surgery is an effective option for severely obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM and weight loss due to gastric bypass surgery is associated with good glycemic control [62].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par375">Nutritional and diet therapy remains an integral part of diabetes management. As there is no &#x0201c;one-size-fits-all&#x0201d; meal plan or eating pattern, RSSDI recommendations emphasis on development of individualized eating plan, based on individual&#x02019;s health needs, personal and cultural preferences, access to healthful choices, health literacy, and numeracy [1, 2] in consonance with ADA [3]. The primary goal of the diet therapy is to improve health by providing calories for normal growth and development while achieving and maintaining optimal glycemia and normalizing dyslipidaemia [4]. Therefore, diets are often altered or/modified with respect to amount of carbohydrate, the type of fat, and the quantity and type of protein to meet these needs. Evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies focusing on nutritional intervention in the prevention of T2DM suggests that intake of foods with more non-starch polysaccharides and omega-3 fatty acids with low glycemic index (GI) may play a protective role, whereas excess intake of saturated fats and TFAs may contribute to the increased risk [2]. In people who are accustomed to consuming sugar sweetened foods, ADA recommends the use of non-nutritive sweeteners in moderate amounts as they have the potential to reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake [3]. However, the exact nature of diet appropriate for patients with T2DM still remains a matter of debate due to lack of tools and strategies that help to decide on healthy eating patterns to minimize the burden of disease [6]. Among Asian Indians from South Asia, intake of refined carbohydrate, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and n-6 PUFA as well as TFAs is higher and intake of n-3 PUFA and fiber is lower [7, 8]. In addition, attitudes, cultural differences, and religious and social beliefs and imbalances in dietary patterns pose significant barriers in effective prevention and management of T2DM [9]. Evidence suggest that intake of MUFAs among Asian Indians ranged from 4.7 to 16.4% that indirectly could contribute to increasing obesity, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM [10, 11]. In this context, it is felt that RSSDI recommendations on diet therapy can suggest approaches to the dietary management of diabetes in Asian Indians (Annexure III).</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par376">The panel endorse most of the IDF recommendations on diet therapy with a few modifications based on the local factors that were reviewed in Indian context including high prevalence of both obesity and undernutrition, poor access to healthy food choices, and inadequate physical activity in some.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar13"><title><italic>Carbohydrate monitoring</italic></title><p id="Par377">

Fat intake should occur mainly in the form of MUFA with a parallel decrease in SFAs and TFAs. Such a diet is particularly beneficial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, and obesity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par383">A recent review suggests that high-carbohydrate diets are at least as effective as low-carbohydrate diets, associated with significant weight loss and a reduction in plasma glucose, A1C, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with T2DM. However, high-carbohydrate diets may raise serum triglyceride levels and reduce high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, which can be improved with the consumption of a low GI/GL foods and high fiber [13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par384">Evidence suggests that in patients with diabetes, weight loss achieved due to intake of low-carbohydrate diets is linked to duration of the diet restriction and reduced energy intake but not with restriction of carbohydrates alone. Therefore, obese diabetes patients should consider switching to a diet reduced in calories and fat to reduce the incidence of T2DM and myocardial infarction [14, 15].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par385">Asian Indians increasingly tend to consume high-carbohydrate diet in the form of refined grain.

Nationwide community intervention programs aimed at creating awareness about the consequences of unhealthy food choices and replacing them with healthy food choices is urgently needed in India. Evidence from initial studies suggests that simple 4-week nutritional counselling provided to increase patient&#x02019;s nutritional knowledge can significantly improve fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels in illiterate to semi-literate patients with T2DM [61], but long-term interventional studies are lacking.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par523">Lifestyle intervention is an integral part of diabetes management along with dietary and pharmacological interventions. Lifestyle interventions, which include increased physical activity, dietary modification, as well as weight reduction among overweight people, have potential to prevent T2DM in high-risk individuals [1, 2]. Obesity, which is one of the foremost reasons for T2DM development and associated with higher CV risk, can be controlled with significant lifestyle modifications. Major forms of lifestyle modifications considered for patients with T2DM include dietary modification and increasing physical activity (both aerobic and resistance training). A wealth of literature supports the fact that regular physical activity reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM. Regular aerobic training not only reduces glycemic burden but also helps to prevent atherosclerotic CVD by several mechanisms. In older adults with diabetes, regular walking was associated with reduced all-cause and CVD mortality [3&#x02013;6]. Interestingly, regular exercise is shown to provide similar benefits in patients with T2DM when these exercises are done in single or multiple bouts, as long as the recommended length of activity is performed. Recent reports indicate positive effects of resistance training in patients with T2DM. All T2DM patients without complications and even those with complications can perform mild&#x02013;moderate physical activity with appropriate caution. Yoga is also known to reduce glycemic parameters, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce the use of OADs [4, 7]. Since Asians are considered to do less physical activity compared to their western counter parts [8], lifestyle modification is of paramount importance for blood glucose control and CV protection in patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par524">The panel endorsed most of the IDF recommendations on lifestyle modifications with additions on the specific role of yoga in the Indian context. The panel considered evidences of physical activity on glycemic parameters in view of the high predisposition of Asian Indians to develop T2DM and CAD. The benefits of yogic practices, individually and when combined with physical activity, are also considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar22"><title><italic>Identification</italic></title><p id="Par525">

However, for the resource-limited settings, the IDF guideline for T2DM encourages increased duration and frequency of physical activity (where needed), up to 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min on 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days/week or an accumulation of 150&#x000a0;min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (50&#x02013;70% of maximum heart rate) [30].

Individuals with diabetes tend to make dramatic impact on the progression and development of diabetes by involving in their own diabetes self-care practices [1]. Moreover, diabetes education improves metabolic control, prevents or delay complications, improves QoL, and empowers people to make informed choices to manage their condition [2]. It is expected that patient who is well-educated has better understanding of the disease and self-manages the condition more effectively [3]. Evidence from literature suggests that implementation of DSME has been successful in lowering glycemic levels in uncontrolled patients [4, 5]. The DSME is an ongoing process that facilitates knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care [5, 6]. It is guided by evidence-based standards while incorporating needs, goals, and life experiences of the person with diabetes [7]. India is a country with diverse social, economic, cultural, and educational patterns with majority of population residing in rural areas. Evidence has also revealed that rural people have less knowledge and awareness than urban Indian people [8]. It is presumed that the poor level of awareness on diabetes in India is due to high percentage of individuals with low or no literacy [9, 10].</p></sec><sec id="Sec53"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par637">The panel endorsed the IDF recommendations on education as such.

The program played a pivotal role in improving the patient&#x02019;s quality of care by overcoming clinical inertia and improving adherence to therapy while preventing the occurrence/progression of diabetes-associated complications [11].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par640">Organized diabetes education that involves improving knowledge on better control of disease symptoms, disease regimens, and dangers in practice was found to positively impact lifestyle changes, self-control abilities, and at the same time improve the QoL in T2DM patients [12].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par641">A recent systematic review including 118 unique interventions reports that DSME was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in A1C (&#x02212;&#x02009;0.74 for intervention and &#x02212;&#x02009;0.17 for control groups) [5].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par642">The National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) course was designed to enable educators in India to provide a complete perspective of the disease condition, the importance of self-care, blood glucose monitoring, diet and physical activity, self-injection of insulin, medication adherence, and the long-term benefits of compliance and a basic awareness of the various complications of diabetes. Following its implementation, most of participants acknowledge that they learned new skills and they were benefited by increase in knowledge, confidence, and improved attitude towards diabetes care among the participants [13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par643">In order to minimize the increasing burden of NCDs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, has launched the National Programme on Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPDCS) on 8 January 2008 with several objectives including health promotion and health education for the community [14].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par644">Besides diabetes, educational intervention was also successful in reducing some of the obesity parameters and improving dietary patterns in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes.

The treatment should also aim at preserving &#x003b2;-cell function and prevent or slow the rate of apoptosis that will in turn delay the natural progression of the disease. Particularly from a patient point of view stability of metabolic control over time may be another specific goal that needs to be considered. Given the progressive loss of &#x003b2;-cell function in T2DM, treatment with OADs is ensued if the target A1C is not achieved with initial lifestyle modification. However, the properties of any antidiabetic agent that play a role in the choice of drug(s) in individual patients may vary because diabetes itself has a different mechanism responsible for its pathophysiology. Several guidelines provide treatment algorithms on ways in which glucose-lowering agents can be used either alone or in combination. The current guideline based on the current clinical evidences provides overview on available OADs and tries to come up with some practically applicable recommendations for optimal management of T2DM in Asian Indians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec61"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par743">The decision on choice of OAD therapy in T2DM patients was based on the cost, safety, and efficacy factors that were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar30"><title><italic>Antidiabetic agents</italic></title><p id="Par744">

Its mechanism of action predominately involves reducing hepatic glucose output [1&#x02013;3]. Metformin is associated with initial gastrointestinal side effects, and caution needs to be taken to avoid its use in patients at risk for lactic acidosis (e.g., in advanced renal insufficiency, alcoholism).

Although they are effective in controlling glucose levels, their use is associated with modest weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia. Modern sulfonylureas particularly gliclazide modified release (MR) and glimepiride have a lower risk of hypoglycemia and are preferred to be used in south Asian T2DM patients [5]. Shorter-acting secretagogues, the meglitinides (or glinides), also stimulate insulin release through similar mechanisms but may be associated with comparatively less hypoglycemia [6] but they require more frequent dosing. Moreover, modern sulfonylureas exhibit more reductions of A1C than glinides [7].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par747"><italic>Thiazolidinediones</italic>: They are peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x003b3; activators [8] that improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and reduce hepatic glucose production [1, 2]. The risk of hypoglycemia is negligible and may be more durable in their effectiveness than sulfonylureas and metformin [9, 10]. Pioglitazone appeared to have a pleotropic effects on cardiovascular events as a secondary outcome in one large trial involving patients with overt macrovascular disease [11]. Pioglitazone had been linked with a possible increased risk of bladder cancer [12]; however, a recent systematic review report that the association of bladder cancer with pioglitazone was not found to be significant [13]. Moreover, data from a retrospective study in India involving 2222 (pioglitazone users, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1111; pioglitazone non-users, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1111) T2DM patients found no evidence of bladder cancer in any of the group, including patients with age &#x0003e;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;years, duration of diabetes &#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;years, and uncontrolled diabetes [14]. Recognized side effects of thiazolidinediones include weight gain, fluid retention leading to edema, and/or heart failure in predisposed individuals and patients with increased risk of bone fractures [9, 11, 13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par748"><italic>DPP4 inhibitors</italic>: Drugs like vildagliptin, saxagliptin, gemigliptin, sitagliptin, teneligliptin, and linagliptin are incretin enhancers; they enhance circulating concentrations of active GLP-1 and gastric intestinal polypeptide (GIP) [15, 16]. Their major effect is the regulation of insulin and glucagon secretion; they are weight neutral. Furthermore, recent CV studies with DPP-4 inhibitors have shown that these agents do not increase the CV risk [17&#x02013;19]. Recent studies have reported a higher incidence of heart failure hospitalization with saxagliptin and alogliptin [17, 18]. However, the reason for the same is not clear and the primary outcomes of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and CV death were not different in intervention arm as compared to placebo arm. Sitagliptin showed no difference in the rate of hospitalization for heart failure [20]. The other DPP4 inhibitors as yet do not have outcome studies published.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par749">Typically, none of the incretin-based classes cause hypoglycemia by themselves. Teneligliptin is a new agent in the class of DPP-4 inhibitor reported to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in Indian T2DM patients as monotherapy or in combination [21, 22]. However, data available for teneligliptin is limited and there are no RCTs available for teneligliptin.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par750"><italic>SGLT2 inhibitors</italic>: They provide insulin-independent glucose-lowering by blocking glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule by inhibiting SGLT2 receptor [23]. These agents provide modest weight loss and BP reduction when used as monotherapy [23, 24]. Dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin are the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents used in patients with T2DM [23]. SGLT2 inhibitors have the potential to reduce CV risk in patients with T2DM [25, 26] not only through beneficial effects on glycemic control but also via beneficial effects on body weight, BP, lipids, and serum uric acid [27, 28]. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce BP in patients with T2DM [29, 30]. Nonetheless, SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of genital infection [31].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par751"><italic>AGIs</italic>: Acarbose, voglibose, and miglitol are the AGIs which retard gut carbohydrate absorption [32, 33] reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. The main adverse effects are gastrointestinal, flatulence, distention, nausea, and diarrhea. Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis report that AGIs might associate with increased risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the evidence is limited and no clinically important AEs were observed [34].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par752"><italic>Colesevelam</italic>, a bile acid sequestrant whose mechanism of glucose-lowering action remains poorly understood and whose major additional benefit is LDL-C reduction [35, 36], is used infrequently in treatment course of diabetes. In a pilot study of colesevelam HCl 3.75&#x000a0;g/day in patients with T2DM, LDL-C and total cholesterol were decreased by 11.7 and 7.8%, respectively, and also A1C was decreased by 0.5% [37]. Adverse effects mainly observed were constipation and GI discomfort.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par753"><italic>Hydroxychloroquine (HYQ)</italic>: Recently, HYQ has been approved by DCGI in the management of T2DM in India. It has a modest effect on reducing A1C along with reduction of pro-inflammatory markers. It was shown to reduce white blood cell (WBC) count and increase adiponectin in many studies [38, 39]. When used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, it has shown to delay new onset diabetes, a promising action helpful in prevention [40]. Moreover, in Indian patients with uncontrolled T2DM, significant difference in glycemic efficacy was not found between HYQ and pioglitazone [41]. Several ongoing trials will throw more light in days to come. Adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal, nausea, vomiting. Blurring of vision, retinopathy, and maculopathy are uncommon if the recommended daily dose is not exceeded [42, 43].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par754">The dopamine agonist bromocriptine (quick release formulation) is also available as an antihyperglycemic agent and supposedly acts by mimicking the morning surge of dopamine [44, 45]. Its mechanism of action and precise role are unclear.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par755">The glucose-lowering effectiveness of OADs is said to be high with metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinedione (expected A1C reduction ~&#x02009;1.0&#x02013;1.5%) and comparatively lower for meglitinides, DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, AGIs, HYQ, colesevelam, and bromocriptine (~&#x02009;0.5&#x02013;1.0%) [10, 46&#x02013;49]. However, older drugs have typically been tested in clinical trial participants with higher baseline A1C, which is associated with greater treatment emergent glycemic reductions, irrespective of therapy type. In head-to-head trials, any differential effects on glucose control between different OADs are small. So agent- and patient-specific properties, such as ease of administration, dosing frequency, side effect profiles, cost, and other benefits, often help in their selection.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par756">Two-drug combination therapies with metformin (such as metformin plus thiazolidinediones, metformin plus sulfonylureas, metformin plus SGLT2 inhibitors, and metformin plus DPP4 inhibitors) were more effective in reducing A1C than metformin monotherapy by about 1% [10]. In addition, triple FDC of metformin and sulfonylurea plus pioglitazone or voglibose are also available in India. Even though they have to be administered with caution and there is some ambiguity regarding their timing of administration, several studies have proved their efficacy in Indian population [50].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par757">RSSDI wheel given along with this recommendation book will help a practitioner choose an ideal drug for his patient based on cost, weight, hypoglycemia risk, and other comorbid conditions</p></list-item></list>

Intensive glycemic management has reduced the mortality, morbidity, and risk of diabetes-related complications in patients with T2DM [6, 7]. Most of the medications available to control glycemia have a final common pathway in the form of targeting &#x003b2;-cells or IR and are dependent upon the presence of insulin for their therapeutic effect. The durability of these medications varies and their safety is occasionally under scrutiny. Over a period, patients fail to achieve or maintain A1C levels even with multiple OADs and will require insulin therapy.</p><p id="Par851">Most guidelines recommend early insulin therapy in patients with high A1C at the time of presentation [1, 8, 9].

Similarly, choice of insulin on the basis of A1C value alone can be challenging. Therefore, to facilitate an objective rationale for the physicians, the following simple ratios could be helpful: ratio of prandial and FPG index ((PPG-FPG)/FPG), ratio of FPG to A1C, and ratio of 1,5-anhydroglucitol and A1C [23].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par890">Recommendations from guidelines:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par891">American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) and ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines recommend initiating insulin therapy with basal insulin.

This must be addressed by focusing on patient education and motivation, as well as updating knowledge of healthcare professionals. Lifestyle modification, self-monitoring, and insulin education should be integral parts of insulin therapy in T2DM. Structured guidelines and protocols should be shared and glycemic audits of persons on oral medications performed to address the issue.</p><p id="Par919">

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par966">Clinicians trained in modern system of medicine are advised not to prescribe alternate therapies to treat T2DM. However, some of the alternate therapies such as plant-based preparations and yoga may be used along with pharmacological therapy in certain patients with T2DM to reduce complications. However, these therapies should not replace conventional diabetes therapies.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par967">As diabetes is a disease which is chronic and controllable, rather than curable, patients are often daunted by the possibility of lifelong allopathic medications. Therefore, some patients use complementary and alternative medicinal (CAM) therapies for its prevention and management [1]. Ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha, homeopathy, and naturopathy systems of medicine are often integrated into diabetes healthcare delivery. More than 300 Indian plant and mineral products have been reported, with sub-optimal therapeutic effects in diabetes. Evidence has established a few beneficial effects of methi, vijaysar, gurmar, neem, amla, ghritkumari, turmeric, black pepper, date fruit, onion, and karela in diabetes [1&#x02013;17]. Moreover, yoga, pranayama, meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, aromatherapy, and many relaxation techniques are being practiced in India, for prevention and management of diabetes [17&#x02013;19]. Furthermore, some dietary supplements including chromium, alpha-lipolic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, and zinc are also having some beneficial effects in the management of diabetes [1]. Although they do not substitute physical activity, they may supplement non-pharmacologic therapies in diabetes. Many of these alternative therapies have not been subjected to or have not withstood the rigorous scientific studies such as RCTs. Hence, the use of these agents may be considered as an adjunct to standard care. Moreover, there is a need to generate evidence on the benefits as well as toxicity of these agents by rigorously conducted clinical trials.</p><p id="Par968">

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par996">eGFR-adjusted doses of gliptins may be a suitable addition to metformin for elderly patients to avoid hypoglycemia and weight gain [3]. Recent double blind RCTs have reported that gliptins are efficacious and safe with no tolerability issue when used as add-on therapy in elderly patients with T2DM [4&#x02013;7].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par997">Agents belonging to AGIs could also be an important choice in elderly patients. These agents have moderate efficacy and minimal side effects like hypoglycemia, but the major limiting factor for their use is the gastrointestinal side effects, such as flatulence and diarrhea [8]. A double blind RCT revealed that compared to diet alone, addition of acarbose improved the glycemic profile and insulin sensitivity in elderly patients with T2DM [9].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par998">Glitazones are a safer alternative in patients with preserved cardiac function. However, postmenopausal females must be spared for their use because of high predisposition to osteoporosis. Furthermore, the use of glitazones is restricted in elderly T2DM patients owing to the complications like weight gain, fluid retention, peripheral edema, aggravation of congestive heart failure, and especially increased risk of bladder cancer associated with their use [10].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par999">Newer sulfonylureas like gliclazide MR and glimepiride (due to low risk of hypoglycemia) and glinides (due to shorter half-life) can be safely used in elderly patients with T2DM [11]. A recent RCT (GENERATION) did not find any significant difference between saxagliptin and glimepiride in elderly T2DM patients [12].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1000">Evidence regarding the use of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2 inhibitors in elder T2DM patients is limited. However, available data suggests that agents of both the classes provide good glycemic control in patients with T2DM. However, certain drawbacks like cost, injection, and limited availability with GLP-1RAs and increased risk of genital and urinary tract infections, hypovolemia, postural hypotension, and weight loss with SGLT2 inhibitors may limit their usage in some older T2DM patients [10].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1001">Early initiation of insulin in older patients was found to be beneficial without increasing risk of hypoglycemia or greater total direct healthcare costs [13]. Evidence suggests that basal insulin analogues like glargine and detemir were effective and safe without any risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain [14, 15]. Moreover, a pooled analysis from five RCTs revealed that addition of insulin glargine compared to NPH insulin to oral antidiabetic drugs in older adults was effective with low risk of hypoglycemia [16].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1002">In addition, individualization of therapy is desirable based on risk of hypoglycemia, comorbidities, functionality, cost, and personal preference.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1004">While prescribing pharmacological treatments for overweight or obese patients with T2DM, providers should first consider antidiabetes medications which cause either weight neutrality or weight loss. Metformin, AGIs, GLP-1 RAs, and SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with weight loss characteristics, and DPP-4 inhibitors appear to be weight neutral [17, 18]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 62 randomized trials revealed that, when compared to other antidiabetic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs were associated with clinically significant body weight loss (range, 1.15&#x02013;2.26&#x000a0;kg) as add-on to metformin [19].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1005">GLP-1 RA seems to be the best add-on therapy for those having high BMI. This group of medications has the highest weight-reducing property in addition to excellent efficacy. A recent systematic review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis report that GLP-1 RAs are associated with weight loss (&#x02212;&#x02009;1.62 to &#x02212;&#x02009;1.01&#x000a0;kg) in overweight or obese patients with T2DM with no difference in weight loss between different types of GLP-1 RAs [20].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1006">SGLT-2 inhibitors also have a weight reduction property. Evidence suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with weight loss in patients with T2DM [21, 22]. Medicines in this group have an additional advantage of excellent tolerance and can be given orally. However, their glycemic efficacy seems to be less than that of GLP-1 RA and also experience with this group of agents is less than that with GLP-1 RA [23].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1007">Gliptins are weight neutral and so can be used as third line of agents [24, 25].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1008">Use of newer sulfonylureas compared to older sulfonylureas and other OADs does not result in significant weight gain in patients with T2DM [26&#x02013;28]. Last option for such kind of patients should be insulin or glitazones since they are having weight gain properties.</p></list-item></list>

Few of the gliptins need dose adjustment as per eGFR while vildagliptin needs dose adjustment in hepatic insufficiency. Linagliptin and teneligliptin do not require any dose adjustment in renal disease [30&#x02013;33].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1011">Repaglinide is another agent which may be used across all stages of renal insufficiency. Similarly, glitazones may be used in CKD; however, one has to be careful about fluid retention [34, 35].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1012">Short-acting sulfonylureas like glipizide can be preferred in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment. Furthermore, in mild/moderate renal impairment, gliclazide and glimepiride may also be used, preferably at lower doses [11].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1013">GLP-1 RAs, owing to their GI adverse effect, limit their use in renal insufficiency patients [34].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1014">AGIs may be used in patients with mild to moderate renal disease [35].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1015">Insulin may be used in any stages of renal insufficiency and is the best agent for this purpose.

As results of recent trials have suggested to utilize an aggressive approach in cases where duration of diabetes &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;years, SU or glinide, as an add-on therapy to metformin, will be the best choices, as they are very potent agents [40]. Addition of glitazones may also be useful at this stage [41].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1018">Apart from this, ADA 2013 stated that lean patients with long duration of disease may benefit from gliptins or sulfonylureas with early use of insulin [42].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1019">Basal insulin analogues are often used in patients with long-standing diabetes to address insulinopenic states [39].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1020">Incretin-based therapies, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, provide postprandial control with lower risks of hypoglycemia than prandial insulin [39]. GLP-1 RA may score over gliptins for this indication as they are more effective than gliptins. Therefore, gliptins may be considered as second add-on option.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1021">SGLT-2 inhibitors may also be useful as second add-on agent due to their insulin-independent action which is pathophysiologically different [43].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1022">AGIs are last choices due to their moderate efficacy.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec99"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1133">Poorly controlled diabetes is associated with increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications which further depend upon both fasting and PPG levels [1&#x02013;4]. Evidence from large controlled clinical trials suggest that intensive glycemic control can significantly decrease the development and/or progression of these complications [1, 5&#x02013;8]. However, tight glycemic control needs to be instituted early in the disease course so that legacy effect can be seen as reduced number of complications even after many years. The relationship between hyperglycemia and CVD is complex with evidence suggesting that an acute increase of glycemia, particularly after a meal, contributes to the increased risk of diabetes-related complications and have a direct detrimental effect on CVD in patients with T2DM [9&#x02013;11]. Until recently, the predominant focus of diabetes treatment has been on lowering A1C levels, with emphasis on FPG [12, 13]. Nevertheless, control of fasting hyperglycemia alone is insufficient to obtain optimal glycemic control. Emerging evidence suggests that reducing PPG excursion is as important or perhaps more important for achieving desired glycemic targets [14]. Usually A1C is supposed to be largely contributed by FPG when it is away from target. As and when it comes closer to the target, PPG starts taking upper hand and contributes predominantly. But in Asian Indians, scenario remains quite different. In Indians, the PPG remains relatively high all across the A1C spectrum and especially very high even at higher A1C values [15&#x02013;17]. Relative contribution of postprandial hyperglycemia to A1C levels in patients with T2DM is higher than FPG levels when the A1C levels are below 7.5% and it decreases progressively as A1C levels increase [18]. Therefore, targeting both PPG and FPG is an important strategy for achieving optimal glycemic control. The purpose of these recommendations is to assist clinicians in developing strategies to consider and effectively manage postmeal glucose in people with T2DM in Asian countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec100"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1134">India has a high prevalence of diabetes and onset of diabetes is a decade early.

It recommends the use of glucose load equivalent to 75&#x000a0;g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water as prescribed by WHO. On the other hand, IDF 2011 defines postprandial hyperglycemia as a plasma glucose level of 140&#x000a0;mg/dL or more after 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h of food intake [19, 20].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1137">Asian Indians display marked rise in prandial glucose excursion after consumption of 75&#x000a0;g of bread meal compared to their Caucasian counterparts [21, 22].</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1154">Currently, there is lack of data linking improved clinical outcomes with that of correcting postprandial hyperglycemia. Neither the Hyperglycemia and Its Effect After Acute Myocardial Infarction on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HEART2D) study nor the Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) study could demonstrate direct benefit of lowering postprandial hyperglycemia in reducing CVD in patients with T2DM [25&#x02013;27].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1155">However, emerging evidence indicates that agents that target PPG show significant positive trends in risk reduction for all selected CV events. Findings from the Study to Prevent Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM) trial also showed that treating people with IGT with acarbose is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of CVD and hypertension [28]. The ongoing Acarbose Cardiovascular Evaluation Trial (ACE) will further elucidate whether acarbose therapy can reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality in patients with IGT who have established CAD or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and will also determine if acarbose therapy can prevent or delay transition to T2DM in this patient population [29]. The panel opined that addressing postprandial hyperglycemia is important with a recommended target of 160&#x000a0;mg/dL, as long as hypoglycemia is avoided.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1156">Postprandial hyperglycemia is an important pathophysiological state contributing to the pathogenesis of CVD in people with and without diabetes. It should be routinely monitored in T2DM patients. Serum glucose level 2-h post-OGTT must be performed as it is a powerful predictor of all-cause premature death and CV risk and a better indicator than FPG [30&#x02013;32]. Management of postprandial hyperglycemia is central to long-term glycemic control and an essential part of CVD prevention in IGT and T2DM. The level of implementation of routine screening for postmeal hyperglycemia, using the OGTT, should be improved in the Asia-Pacific region, combined with wider use of effective interventions to manage postprandial hyperglycemia [33].</p></list-item></list>

Consumption of rice is very high in South India which is associated with four- to fivefold increase in risk of diabetes [36]. The higher carbohydrate load in the Indian diet leads to greater PPG excursion, increased glucosidase, and incretin activity in the gut which leads to higher lipaemic peaks and associated CVD [35]. Evidence suggests that diets with low glycemic index values are beneficial in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia [13, 37, 38].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1162">To promote effective postprandial hyperglycemia control, the panel emphasized on advising patients on MNT which should include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1163">Carbohydrate should constitute 45&#x02013;65% of total caloric intake, with a minimum of 130&#x000a0;g/day for adults<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1164">Consumption of low glycemic index foods</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1165">Increase intake of soluble and insoluble fiber</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1166">Consumption of fruits and vegetables in place of refined carbohydrate</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1167">10&#x02013;15% proteins and fats less than 30%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1168">Saturated fats should be less than 7%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1169">Cholesterol less than 300&#x000a0;mg/day<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1170">

AGIs have been shown to effectively control postprandial hyperglycemia while providing additional benefits in terms of CV risk protection [39, 40]. Moreover, AGIs tend to inhibit carbohydrate absorption from gut which can be of particular importance in Indian settings where there are increased odds for PPG and lipid excursion due to consumption of diets with high glycemic index.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec111"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1243">Monitoring of blood glucose levels is critically important to ensure good glycemic control. It is considered the cornerstone of diabetes care that helps both physicians and patients to adjust the therapy according to patient&#x02019;s need. Following clinical testing to assess levels of control and progression of T2DM, most guidelines recommend clinicians to perform frequent monitoring of glycemic status by measurement of A1C as a follow-up care of individuals with diabetes [1, 2]. Moreover, A1C measurement is the gold standard for the therapeutic management of diabetes in both research and in clinical settings, which involves assessing glycemic control over the previous 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;months [3, 4]. Long-term hyperglycemia as measured by A1C has been shown to be strongly related to development of diabetic microvascular complications though its relation to development of macrovascular complications is less clear. Therefore, patients who are not at targets or at increased risk of developing complications require more intensive monitoring, ranging from frequent self-monitored glucose [3, 5] to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) [6, 7] to assess daily variations in blood glucose levels [8]. The current recommendations provide an insight on the importance and frequency of monitoring to be performed in order to facilitate medication and lifestyle changes when average A1C values remain above targets levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec112"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1244">The decision on clinical monitoring of glycemic levels in T2DM patients was based on the local factors such as availability of newer technologies and cost of monitoring that were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec113"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar35"><title><italic>A1C for monitoring blood glucose</italic></title><p id="Par1245">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1246">Several guidelines and literature pertaining to monitoring emphasize on adjustments to the treatment based on glycemic measurements, methods available for monitoring, and their quality implementation. Evidence suggests that regular monitoring of A1C will facilitate identification of patients with poor glycemic control and help both physicians and patients to take necessary steps to achieve desired glycemic targets [9, 10]. Though frequent monitoring of A1C is associated with reduced diabetes-related complications and improved metabolic control [10, 11], most patients do not understand or are not aware of importance of glycemic monitoring. Therefore, it becomes absolutely necessary to empower the patients with knowledge and understanding on A1C levels for optimal glycemic control that will in turn motivate them to effectively manage their diabetes [10, 12].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1247">The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) working group on A1C standardization have established a reference measurement procedure (HPLC-MS or HPLC-CE) for A1C embracing the concept of metrological traceability [13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1248">Though IDF recommends reporting IFCC units (mmol A1C per mol unglycated hemoglobin), the panel suggested reporting A1C in DCCT aligned values (%) as majority of the physicians are not familiar with new IFCC units. However, it was emphasized that the healthcare professionals should be made aware of the new IFCC units and encouraged to practice them during routine clinical practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1249">The concept of eAG was introduced following introduction of continuous ambulatory blood glucose monitoring [14]. The eAG may help people with diabetes relate their A1C to daily glucose monitoring and highlight any inaccuracies in A1C measurement relative to glucose levels [15]. There are calculators available for converting A1C to eAG in both millimoles per liter and milligrams per deciliter. Measurement of timed glucose levels are often recommended as a substitute for A1C when the latter is either unavailable or inappropriate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1250">In a meta-analysis, <italic>Cavagnolli et al</italic>. found that A1C values are higher in blacks, Asians, and Latinos when compared to white persons [16]. Even though this observation is made in non-diabetes patients, authors claim that these differences might influence the use of same A1C point to diagnose diabetes in all ethnic populations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1251">Abnormal hemoglobin levels are known to affect A1C values in a way that can significantly alter the results with regard to diabetes control [17]. Therefore, it is important to consider hematological factors that can confound A1C levels in people with diabetes, best detected using HPLC-based assays.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1252">Anemia significantly impacts A1C levels. In a cross-sectional study, <italic>Rajagopal et al</italic>. have found that the mean A1C in patients with controlled diabetes with IDA was significantly higher than those without IDA (7.86&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.11 vs 5.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.038% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05)). They also found that A1C values were higher with the reduction of total hemoglobin (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [18]. Similarly, <italic>Madhu et al</italic>. have found significantly higher A1C levels in IDA subjects than healthy people (5.51&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.696 vs 4.85&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.461%,&#x000a0;<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). They also found a significant decline in A1C levels after iron supplementation (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [19]. Therefore, A1C results in diabetes patients with IDA should be interpreted carefully. IDA has to be corrected before a proper diagnosis is made.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1253">Measurement of blood glucose using blood glucose meters on admission to hospital wards helps to identify patients with hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Considering that in developing nations like India, where cost is major barrier for monitoring, these devices should be accurate and cost-effective and field testing specifically tailored for Asian and Indian needs is imperative. Such data is available from only one study in India by Dr. Mohan&#x02019;s group from Chennai that evaluated the performance of glucose meter for Indian conditions across different values and temperatures [20].</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1255">Plasma glucose is the preferred measure of most modern laboratories. Whole blood gives lower readings due to the volume occupied by hemoglobin. Capillary blood glucose strips measure the glucose in the plasma of the capillary blood sample but may be calibrated to give results either as plasma or sometimes whole blood glucose (check meter instructions).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec114"><title><bold>Implementation</bold></title><p id="Par1256">There should be access to a laboratory or site-of-care test monitored by certified quality assurance schemes for measurement of A1C. People in whom A1C measurement is inappropriate must be identified by careful review of hematological parameters and other factors that can affect A1C values. Provision of capillary blood glucose meters and strips needs to be assured in hospitals and clinics. It is important to ascertain whether there are contraindications for use of a particular type of glucose meter in a particular patient. It is essential to establish whether meters report values for plasma or blood and to ensure that schemes for monitoring the quality of their output are in place. Blood glucose meters should be calibrated on regular basis and their use in hospitals should be restricted to trained personnel.</p><p id="Par1257">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec119"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1300">Frequent and precise blood glucose monitoring and concomitant optimal adjustment of insulin to carbohydrate intake and exercise are the basis of diabetes treatment. The SMBG is an essential component of the modern diabetes treatment and the most uncomplicated and commonly used strategy of interim glucose monitoring across the globe [1]. Established advantages with SMBG include achieving target A1C, reducing glucose variability, and prediction of severe hypoglycemia [2]. Therefore, it has been recommended for achieving a specific level of glycemic control and to prevent hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. The objective of SMBG is to assemble detailed information about blood glucose levels at various time points to enable maintenance of a more constant glucose level by more precise regimens. It can be used to aid in the adjustment of a therapeutic regimen in response to blood glucose values and to benefit individuals regulate their dietary intake, physical activity, and insulin doses to improve glycemic control on a day-to-day basis [2, 3]. SMBG serves as a vital adjunct to A1C as it can differentiate the fasting, preprandial, and postprandial hyperglycemic levels; detect the glycemic excursions; recognize and contribute in monitoring resolution of hypoglycemia; and provide immediate feedback to patients about the effects of food choices, activity, and medication on glycemic control [4].</p><p id="Par1301">In diabetes patients on intensive insulin regimens, SMBG is suggested at premeals, during snack, and bedtime, occasionally after eating, preexercise, when suspicion of and after correction of hypoglycemia, and before tasks like driving [5, 6]. There is also a positive relationship between frequency of SMBG and improvements in A1C and early detection of lower glucose values prior to symptomatic hypoglycemia may allow correction with a reduced risk for hyperglycemia [7]. Use of SMBG during exercise may also allow improved insulin management and reduce risk for hypoglycemia during and following exercise [8]. Measurement of blood glucose at different times in a day helps in management of improving blood glucose profiles, confirming hypoglycemia, monitoring recovery, and preventing hyperglycemic crises [3].</p><p id="Par1302">A recent observation study of diabetes self-management conducted by <italic>Schnell et al</italic>. revealed that SMBG implementation leads to an improvement in metabolic control, along with a significant improvement in diabetes management [9]. SMBG coupled with training in self-titration of insulin doses has resulted not only in better compliance and glycemic control but also increased the chances of achieving tight A1C target.</p><p id="Par1303">In patient who have stable oral regimen with A1C within the target range, SMBG data can be used as biofeedback at times of increased stress or changes in diet or physical activity. While patients whose diabetes is not in control or have initiated medication, SMBG data can be helpful in modifying or creating the diabetes management regimen [10].</p><p id="Par1304">SMBG has been well studied among individuals with diabetes and has proved to be a useful tool in improving glycemic control effectively and recognizing low blood glucose levels before the development of severe hypoglycemia [5]. Landmark clinical trials of insulin-treated patients have included SMBG as part of the multifactorial interventions to demonstrate the benefit of intensive glycemic control on diabetes complications [11, 12]. Clinical evidence supports a correlation between greater SMBG frequency and lower A1C. Moreover, patient&#x02019;s specific needs and goals should not only determine but in fact should dictate SMBG frequency and timing [13].</p><p id="Par1305">Despite being recommended in various guidelines [13, 14], a large gap between recommended to current practices of SMBG is observed in both developed and developing countries. In India, this strategy is still not properly understood or implemented. Lunch and dinner are our major meals of the day and glycemic variations are not recorded during routine tests which are invariably done in the morning. Availability of meals with varying glycemic indices and affordability of glucose meters and strips are major factors that play a dominant role either in recommending or practicing SMBG. Fortunately, the advent of less expensive meters and a reduction in the cost of the strips has considerably brightened the scenario. Apart from this, SMBG use is also associated with improved cost-effectiveness [15]. In this consensus, we have evaluated various literature and recommendations on SMBG available online and drawn statement to fit Indian scenario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec120"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1306">The decision including SMBG in clinical practice was based on the factors such as availability of and access to glucose meters and foods with varying glycemic indices that were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec121"><title><bold>Rationale</bold></title><sec id="FPar37"><title><italic>The aims of SMBG should include the following</italic> [16, 17]:</title><p id="Par1307">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec122"><title><bold>Optimization</bold></title><p id="Par1317">SMBG accuracy is dependent on the instrument and user. Therefore, it is important to evaluate individual patient&#x02019;s monitoring technique, both initially and at regular intervals thereafter. Optimal use of SMBG requires proper review and interpretation of the data, both by the patient and healthcare provider [18]. Among patients who check their blood glucose at least once daily, many report taking no action when results are high or low. Patients should be taught how to use SMBG data to adjust food intake, exercise, or pharmacological therapy to achieve specific goals. Ongoing need for and frequency of SMBG should be reevaluated at each routine visit. SMBG is especially important for insulin-treated patients to monitor and prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia [19]. In a prospective Japanese study, <italic>Nishimura et al</italic>. have found that structured blood glucose testing comprising of seven-point SMBG for three consecutive days once every 2&#x000a0;months is beneficial for glycemic control rather than routine testing involving SMBG measurements three times each week before breakfast or dinner [20]. However, daily self-management was better with routine testing. The authors conclude that these two regimens can be individualized when SMBG is used less frequently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec123"><title><bold>Evidence from India</bold></title><p id="Par1318">

As it is important to determine the frequency and intensity of SMBG needed to support the chosen treatment regimen, one should also consider practical obstacles to monitoring, such as affordability or access and individualize glycemic target and modify monitoring patterns accordingly [16, 22].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1321">Insulin self-titration interventions based on structured SMBG are associated with significant reduction in A1C during a follow-up of 12&#x000a0;weeks with a trend towards greater effectiveness in improving glycemic control than conventional treatment, with no increase in incidence of hypoglycemia or body weight gain [23].</p></list-item></list>

Blood glucose meters should be calibrated on a regular basis. Low-cost glucose strips and meters should be developed and made available for wider implementation of SMBG. Strategies that can lower PPG excursions in people with postprandial hyperglycemia should be implemented.</p><p id="Par1323">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec129"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1391">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of diabetes and one of the leading causes of blindness or vision impairment in India [1, 2]. Visual loss from DR could be due to diabetic macular edema (DME) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Global data suggests that the overall prevalence as 35.4% for any DR and around 7.5% for PDR [3]. Factors such as longer duration of diabetes and poorer glycemic and BP control were found to be strongly associated with DR [3, 4]. In a cross-sectional study carried out by All India Ophthalmological Society, prevalence of DR was 21.7% and the rate was high in males (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007), in patients with diabetes duration &#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), in patients with age &#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x000a0;years (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), in insulin users (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), and in patients with history of vascular accidents (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0014) [2]. Furthermore, in the cross-sectional survey of Indian patients with T2DM in chronic complications in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in India (CINDI) and cardiovascular risk factors, micro- and macrovascular complications at diagnosis in patients with young onset type 2 diabetes in India (CINDI 2) studies DR was prevalent in 6.1 and 5.1% patients, respectively [5, 6]. Moreover, the socioeconomic burden resulting from DR induced visual impairment or blindness, particularly in the working age group, is a serious concern [7]. Therefore, it is high time to devise the means of managing DR and bring the problem under control. Early diagnosis, optimization of risk factors, and timely photocoagulation at appropriate places could entirely prevent the blindness from diabetes [8]. Moreover, a systematic approach to health education and creating awareness among patients and various health personnel and matching it with appropriate screening and service delivery mechanisms will go a long way in preventing blindness due to DR. Furthermore, early detection and management of DR with quick referrals and a highly coordinated teamwork between the endocrinologists and the ophthalmologists could reduce the prevalence of DR in India [9]. In addition, these recommendations will provide insights on the management of DR while promoting awareness and thus preventing vision impairment due to DR through cost-effective interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec130"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1392">The recommendations on management of DR were taken from IDF 2014. However, few of the IDF recommendations were modified based on the local factors such as limited resources, high prevalence of DR, lack of quality assurance in labs, and availability of newer technologies and therapies for eye screening and treatment which were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec131"><title><bold>Rationale/evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar38"><title><italic>Screening</italic></title><p id="Par1393">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1394">Several guidelines emphasize on eye screening in T2DM; however, it appears they are divided on the frequency of screening. Some recommend annual screening (NICE-UK) while others recommend screening every 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;years (Canadian-Canada, Australian-Australia, and SIGN-Scotland).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1395">With regard to frequency of screening in limited care setting, the panel endorsed the ADA recommendation which suggests less frequent examinations (every 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years) following one or more normal eye examinations [10].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1396">Screening methods for DR include direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, stereoscopic color film fundus photography, mydriatic or non-mydriatic digital color, and monochromatic photography [11, 12].</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1398">DR is the foremost cause of blindness in women during their motherhood time, and pregnancy increases the short-term risk of DR progression [11]. The possible relationship between DR and the perinatal outcome has been addressed in several studies [13, 14]. Women with high severity of DR were more likely to develop obstetric complications [13, 15] and those with proliferative changes accounted for higher incidence of congenital malformations and/or fetal death [13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1399">As pregnancy can induce progression of DR, the panel recommended preconception counselling for women, clearly explaining about the risk of progression of DR during pregnancy especially if they already have proliferative retinopathy. They should be advised on maintaining good glycemic control before and throughout pregnancy under the guidance of healthcare professional. In addition the panel emphasized on the need for close follow-up during pregnancy and up to 1&#x000a0;year postpartum and monitor for progression of DR and co-existing hypertension and renal disease, if any.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1401">Though surgical interventions are crucial for cataract management, most of the patients, particularly those with complicated cataracts, may not restore the vision. These patients eventually develop corneal decompensation, glaucoma, and optic atrophy [16]. Because the prognosis of retina is poor especially in the presence of mature cataract, the panel suggested that it is important to educate the patient about guarded prognosis for regaining vision after IOL surgery.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec132"><title><bold>Evidence</bold></title><p id="Par1402">Though evidence from past studies suggests that prevalence of DR is low in Indians compared to other ethnic groups, emerging data indicate significant increase in prevalence of retinopathy in South Asians compared to Caucasians [17]. Data from a population-based study (CURES) indicate that the overall prevalence of DR in urban South Indian population was 17.6%, with higher prevalence among men than in women (21.3 vs 14.6%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and among subjects with proteinuria (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) [18]. Similarly, prevalence of DR in western India was found to be 33.9% [19]. Data from a recent population-based cross-sectional study suggests that one of 10 individuals in rural South India, above the age of 40&#x000a0;years, had evidence of DR [20]. A meta-analysis of seven studies from India found 14.9% of known diabetes patients aged &#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;years and 18.1% among those aged &#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years had DR. Furthermore, no linear trend was observed between age and the proportion with DR [21]. Duration of diabetes, A1C, male gender, macroalbuminuria, and insulin therapy were found to be strongly associated with increased risk of DR among South Indians [22, 23]. Moreover, the risk of nephropathy (OR, 5.3; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and neuropathy (OR, 2.9; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) was significantly higher among T2DM patients with DR compared to those without DR [24]. After adjusting for age, gender, A1C, SBP, serum triglycerides, and duration of diabetes, DR was significantly associated with nephropathy (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) than with neuropathy [24].</p></sec><sec id="Sec133"><title><bold>Implementation</bold></title><p id="Par1403">Sufficient number of trained general ophthalmologists and general physicians is required to develop an integrated DR model that facilitates early detection and create awareness on DR. Medical camps should be conducted for screening of diabetes and DR screening camps, which will help to identify people at risk of sight-threatening DR and initiate treatment including laser photocoagulation or vitreous surgery. Mobile vans with a fundus camera or other low-cost tools that can be used in remote rural areas should also be explored. However, successful implementation of program requires team approach, involving both administrative and voluntary organizations.</p><p id="Par1404">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec137"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1442">Neuropathies are the most common complication of diabetes, affecting up to 50% of patients with T2DM [1]. Metabolic disruptions in the peripheral nervous system (altered protein kinase C activity and increased polyol pathway activity) due to hyperglycemia play a key role in the development of DN [2, 3]. Approximately 30% patients either with known or newly diagnosed diabetes are suffering from DN [4, 5]. In the cross-sectional survey of Indian patients with T2DM in CINDI and CINDI 2 studies, DN was prevalent in 13.15 and 13.2% patients, respectively [6, 7]. The most common form of DN is the distal symmetrical polyneuropathy that involves both tibial and sural nerves [8]. Presence of neuropathy is associated with significant morbidity, including recurrent foot infection and ulcers, impotence in men with diabetes, and sudden death in individuals with CV autonomic neuropathy. Neuropathic pain in patients with diabetes is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Therefore, timely screening and early detection ensure prevention of the progression of DN [9]. The present recommendations provide insights on the management aspects of DN while exploring newer therapeutic options that have emerged in recent years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec138"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1443">The panel endorsed the IDF 2014 recommendations for diagnosis and management of DN.

A cross-sectional study in T2DM patients that examined the nerve conduction velocities of motor and sensory nerves using NSS and NDS in patients of clinically detectable neuropathy showed significant electrophysiological changes with duration of T2DM [11]. Similar results were observed in another study where NSS and NDS together helped in prompt evaluation of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy and also in diagnosing subclinical cases [13&#x02013;15]. A study that validated the use of NSS and NDS for clinical diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in middle-aged 855 T2DM patients showed that NSS and NDS can detect DN with a sensitivity of 71.1% and specificity of 90% and was found to be simple, acceptable, reproducible, and validated method for early diagnosis of DN [12, 16].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1446">The panel emphasized on neurological examination using NSS and NDS as it is an important bed side tool and a useful resource in evaluating diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy.</p></list-item></list>

It affects 10&#x02013;40% of T2DM patients who eventually suffer from kidney failure [4, 5]. In the cross-sectional survey of Indian patients with T2DM in CINDI and CINDI 2 studies, DN was prevalent in 1.06 and 0.9% patients, respectively [6, 7]. Cost of treatment for advanced CKD is substantial. Less than 10% of ESRD patients have access to any kind of renal replacement therapy [8, 9]. Thus, in a country with limited resources, it becomes appropriate to direct efforts towards prevention of CKD rather than the treatment. In India, with an increase in the prevalence of diabetes, it becomes imperative to evolve definite guidelines for detection of diabetic nephropathy and suggest practical clinical recommendations to combat it. Improving glycemic control, aggressive antihypertensive treatment, and the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs will slow down the rate of progression of nephropathy [10, 11]. In addition, protein restriction and other treatment modalities such as phosphate lowering may have benefits in selected patients [12].</p></sec><sec id="Sec145"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1517">The panel endorsed the IDF 2014 recommendations for diagnosis and management of diabetic nephropathy. However, few of the recommendations were modified based on local factors such as limited resources, lack of quality assurance in labs, higher prevalence of diabetic kidney disease, and hypertension and cost of treatment of kidney failure through dialysis or transplantation which were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec146"><title><bold>Rationale/evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar43"><title><italic>Screening for urinary protein excretion</italic></title><p id="Par1518">

EPE was found to be useful in serial evaluation of kidney function in Indian patients with diabetes [13, 14]. Moreover, EPE is a simple and inexpensive screening procedure for urinary protein excretion which can be used as a diagnostic test in outpatient wards, particularly in developing countries like India.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1520">As EPE is an inexpensive screening procedure to assess kidney function, the panel recommended it for use in Indian population who are at risk of diabetic nephropathy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1521">Screening of microalbuminuria and estimation of glycated albumin can help in the clinical management of diabetic nephropathy [15]. Screening for albuminuria by measuring urine albumin concentration or estimating ACR is acceptable in Asian population [16]. However, evidence suggests that vigorous exercise even for short periods (15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min) leads to ACR above the microalbuminuria threshold even in healthy subjects [17, 18].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1522">On the basis of evidence, the panel suggested that physicians should ask about recent vigorous exercise and avoid measuring urine albumin excretion for at least 24&#x000a0;h in the presence of same.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1525"> IDF recommends limiting protein intake to 1&#x000a0;g/kg body weight daily among individuals with CKD, if they are found proteinuric. Similarly, ADA recommends protein intake should be 0.8&#x000a0;g/kg/body weight/day in patients with CKD [2]. In the Indian context, the source of protein is mainly from vegetable and animal oils and daily protein consumption is about 0.6&#x02013;0.8&#x000a0;g/kg body weight [19]. Furthermore, protein content in non-vegetarian diet was found to be higher when compared to the vegetarian diet [20]. In addition, evidence suggests that animal protein may aggravate the risk of diabetes [21].

A recent systematic review reports that consumption of &#x02265;&#x02009;15 packs of cigarette/year increases the risk of progression of CKD [25].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec152"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1621">Diabetic foot problems are one of the most common reasons for hospitalization of patients with diabetes (about 30% of admissions) and consume about 20% of the total healthcare costs of the disease compared to all other diabetic complications [1, 2, 3]. In India, prevalence of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes in clinic population varies from 3 to 14% [4&#x02013;6]. Peripheral neuropathy, Charcot arthropathy, foot ulcers, infections, and lower extremity amputations are the various lower limb complications seen in diabetes patients [6]. Strategies aimed at preventing foot ulcers are cost-effective and can even be cost-saving if increased education and efforts are focused on those patients with recognized risk factors for the development of foot problem. The management of diabetic foot disease may seem poorly defined by comparison with complications such as nephropathy, hyperlipidemia, and retinopathy, for which clear guidelines exist. A multidisciplinary team approach, particularly in specialized diabetic foot clinics, is very successful in avoiding and treating foot complications. Present guideline focuses on the various mechanisms of managing diabetic foot disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec153"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1622">The panel endorsed the IDF 2014 recommendations for diagnosis and management of diabetic foot complications. However, few of the recommendations were modified based on local factors such as limited resources and lack of quality assurance in labs, which were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec154"><title><bold>Rationale/evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar45"><title><italic>Detection and timely screening</italic></title><p id="Par1623">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1624">Vibration perception threshold (VPT) is considered as a gold standard for diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, simple clinical scores such as NSS and diabetic neuropathy examination (DNE) scores were found to be simple and useful tools for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy in patients with diabetes [7, 8]. Moreover, a good correlation between VPT score with tuning fork, monofilament, and ankle reflex was found suggesting that simple bed side tests are useful in clinical practice, even in those subjects in whom foot care practices are not followed [9, 10].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1625">Using NSS and NDS in T2DM patients has been found to be a useful resource in evaluating diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy as an important bed side tool [11&#x02013;13] (Annexure XII).</p></list-item></list>

Therefore, the panel emphasized on educating patients on problems associated with walking bare foot [17] and advice on the use of appropriate/therapeutic footwear, particularly those at high risk to prevent the development of foot deformities and ulceration [18].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1628">A questionnaire-based study evaluating the foot care knowledge and practices with foot complications in 300 Indian patients suggests that majority of these patients were not educated previously about foot care and walked indoors without foot wear. The study emphasized that poor knowledge of foot care and poor footwear practices are important risk factors for foot problems in diabetes and called for a joint effort from doctors and footwear industry and to educate patients about foot care and improve their choice and selection of footwear so as to reduce foot problems [19].</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec160"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1680">The risk of developing infectious diseases due to diabetes is now being considered an important complication of diabetes [1, 2]. Diabetes increases the risk of infection by two to three times in comparison to the non-diabetic population. The morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, and hepatitis, which is usually preventable by appropriate vaccination, also appear to be very high in diabetes subjects [3]. Patients with T2DM, especially those with PVD, are at high risk for many types of typical and atypical infections due to immune dysfunction, DN, and poor circulation [4]. Furthermore, skin breakdown in patients with advanced diabetes and PVD provides a portal of entry for bacteria. Longer duration of diabetes and poor glycemic control causes increased risk of pneumonia related hospitalizations in diabetes subjects due to compromised immune system of the host [5]. A recent study demonstrated that patients with high blood glucose level are at increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia [6, 7]. Even certain viral infections can lead to new onset of diabetes in the population who are genetically prone to develop diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec161"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1681">The decision about conducting a screening program should be based on local factors such as limited resources and high prevalence of diabetes-related infections factors that were reviewed in Indian context.</p></sec><sec id="Sec162"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar48"><title><italic>Infections in diabetes</italic></title><p id="Par1682">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1683">Several factors have been implicated for infections in diabetes, of which, altered immunity is the most predominant one [4, 8]. Other predisposing factors increasing susceptibility to infections include diabetes-related complications, frequent catheterization, and dialysis in chronic renal failure patients. Evidence that these immunological defects can be corrected through good glycemic control support the importance of close monitoring of infectious diseases in subjects with diabetes [9].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1684">Urinary tract, respiratory tract, and foot and deep soft infections are most common in T2DM occurring with increased incidence and resulting in high mortality [10, 11].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1685">Following section deals with evidences from Indian and global studies on infections that commonly occur in patients with diabetes.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1686"><italic>Influenza</italic>: Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization after influenza infection and quadruples the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission after hospitalization [12]. Death rates among patients with diabetes during influenza epidemics may increase up to 5&#x02013;15% [13]. Evidence that influenza can trigger coronary complications, when taken in the context of diabetes subjects, gains more significance since the risk for CVD is already two- to fourfold higher in this subgroup [11, 14].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1687"><italic>Retroviral infections</italic>: Cirrhosis of liver in diabetes patients results in higher incidence of glucose intolerance (60&#x02013;96%) and overt diabetes (20&#x02013;60%) [15]. Elevated rates of inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction are observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with T2DM [16]. Moreover, in HIV patients undergoing active retroviral therapy, autoimmune diabetes may be caused due to protein inhibitors and nucleoside analogues. Therefore, in HIV patients with compensated cirrhosis and high IR, insulin should be the preferred choice of treatment [15].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1688"><italic>Malignant otitis externa</italic>: This commonly occurs in patients with diabetes and is mostly caused by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [17]. It can be prevented by creating proper awareness regarding healthy ear cleaning practices like not using commercially available ear buds and other foreign objects or unsterilized cotton. Management protocol comprises of strict glycemic control, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improvement in immuno-competence, aural toileting, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and prolonged systemic, and ototopic antimicrobial therapy (3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks) with agents such as piperacillin with tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and cefoperazone [17].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1689"><italic>Infections of hand and upper limb</italic>: Diabetes ulcers in the upper limb should be promptly treated with adequate surgical means in order to prevent spreading of infection. Creating awareness on healthy cleaning practices minimizes disability and result in better outcome [18].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1690"><italic>UTIs</italic>: These, mostly asymptomatic bacterial infections, occur more frequently in female diabetes patients. In all hospitalized diabetes patients, it is recommended to perform urine culture to detect presence of bacteriuria, a condition leading to an unexplained worsening of the glycemic control in some patients [19].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1691"><italic>Hepatitis</italic>: It has been observed that several patients with underlying diabetes suffer from prolonged or complicated course of acute viral hepatitis. It is possible that with impaired hepatocyte regenerating capacity, these patients run a more prolonged and complicated course. In diabetes population, hepatitis B and C produce more comorbidities and prolonged infections.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1692">Even though hepatitis B virus (HBV) itself may not cause diabetes directly, cirrhosis derived from HBV infection poses twofold higher risk for T2DM [20]. Infection due to HBV may occur during monitoring of blood glucose and other procedures involving multi-patient use of finger-stick devices designed for single-patient use and inadequate disinfection and cleaning of blood glucose monitors between patients [21].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1693">When hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection occurs in diabetes patients, the chronicity as well as risk of infections further increase. In a meta-analysis of 22 studies, it was found that patients with T2DM were at higher risk for acquiring HCV than non-T2DM patients (OR, 53.50; 95% CI, 52.54, 54.82) [22].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1694">Hepatitis A is the most common vaccine-preventable virus acquired during travel and it is highly prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. Protection with hepatitis A vaccination is proven to last at least 15&#x000a0;years [23].</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1695"><italic>Tuberculosis</italic>: Because diabetes impairs host defense mechanism, it has long been known to be a risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB) and reactivation of latent TB [24]. Evidence suggests that the risk of developing TB is increased among patients with diabetes, particularly during the first year after diagnosis of diabetes [25]. Furthermore, it is associated with worse treatment outcomes, higher rates of relapse, and higher mortality rates in patients affected by both diseases. It is estimated that 15% of TB cases globally could be attributed to diabetes and 40% of these cases are from India and China [26]. Moreover, in developing Asian countries, prevalence of TB among diabetes patients was 1.8&#x02013;9.5 times higher than in the general population [26]. The situation is particularly challenging in low-income and middle-income countries where TB is endemic. Data from a systematic review of 13 observational studies indicate that efforts to diagnose, detect, and treat diabetes early may have a beneficial impact on TB control [27].</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1697">Various types of vaccinations recommended to prevent these infections are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1698"><italic>Pneumococcal vaccination</italic>: Two pneumococcal vaccines are available: PPSV23 and PCV13. Secondary immune response after PCV13 immunization is higher, whereas response is lower after immunization with PPSV23 vaccine [28].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1699">The panel recommends the use of PCV13 for adults &#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 1&#x000a0;year later (and at least 5&#x000a0;years after their previous PPSV23 dose) depending on the clinical judgment of the physician. These recommendations are in line with the guidelines from the ADA 2017 and are also in synergy with the guidelines released recently by the Indian Society of Nephrology 2016, Indian Academy of Allergy 2017, and the Geriatric Society of India 2015 [29&#x02013;32].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1700">PCV13 is available for vaccination of older adults and must be considered an important step for vaccinating older diabetes patients with age of &#x0003e;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years. PPSV23 may be offered to immune-compromised patients with diabetes for additional coverage after PCV13. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 must be avoided to prevent hypo-responsiveness. Clinical judgment in relation to individual subjects should be relied upon before these recommendations are put into practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1701"><italic>Influenza vaccination</italic>: In all patients with T2DM with age &#x02265;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months, excluding those who are allergic to eggs, influenza vaccine is recommended [33, 34]. Influenza vaccination among diabetes patients reduced hospital admissions by 79% in two influenza epidemics in England [35].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1702"><italic>HBV</italic>: To all unvaccinated patients with diabetes of age 19&#x02013;59&#x000a0;years, three dose series of HBV is recommended [34].

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1706">Despite the importance of vaccination in diabetes patients, vaccination rates are low in them. In a survey on 307 diabetes patients in Singapore, only 30.6% of patients were found to be vaccinated with influenza vaccine [36]. Another cross-sectional survey on 279 diabetes patients in Spain determined the vaccination rates for seasonal influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis B as 40, 2, and 2%, respectively [37]. A survey on 274 elderly people in Turkey revealed that the proportion of diabetes patients vaccinated for influenza or pneumococcus or tetanus as 38.1, 13.4, and 9.28%, respectively [38].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1707">Perception, knowledge, and misconception that vaccines are infective and cause side effects are some of the barriers for avoiding vaccination [36, 37].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1708">Maintaining a diabetes registry, systemic tracking system, and reminder system serve as tools for improvising the acceptance to vaccination and communicating with the subjects for the need of vaccination which provides awareness on immunization [37, 39]. The combined used of patient outreach letters, special immunization clinics, standing orders, and practitioner reminders on medical records resulted in a remarkable 15-fold increase in pneumococcal vaccinations in diabetes patients in Guam, USA [40]. Similarly, a combination of strategies including dissemination of guidelines, advice on setting up disease and vaccine registers, call and recall systems, and benchmarking of performance remarkably improved influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in high-risk individual groups including diabetes patients in UK [41]. Periodic training of the staff accompanied by ongoing assessment of immunization rates and work flow and also a close follow-up with the patient or his caregiver by the treatment team are beneficial in minimizing the risk of inappropriate revaccinations [42].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1709">The protocols should also aim at implementing a quality assurance process so that the standards of care are maintained [43].</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec163"><title><bold>Implementation</bold></title><p id="Par1710">Apart from the micro- and macrovascular events in diabetes, infections due to influenza and pneumococci should be considered as significant public health concern. All clinics providing vaccinations shall maintain the records to assess the efficacy of vaccines regarding occurrence of various complications in vaccinated individuals compared to non-vaccinated subjects. Vaccination strategies in diabetes should evolve as part of routine care and a central registry needs to be maintained.</p><p id="Par1711">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec168"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1785">Fasting is a common religio-cultural practice followed in different forms according to various religions across the world. Hindus perform fasting during Navaratri, Karva Chauth, and Guru Purnima, Muslims observe during Ramadan, Buddhist performs during Lent, and Jains keep fasting in occasion of Paryushana [1&#x02013;3]. Religious fasting is a means of inculcating discipline in an individual but not to impose excessive hardship [4]. Fasting is a time of great spiritual growth and can also improve physical well-being if properly undertaken. Though preference for religious fasting is a personal decision, persons with diabetes may fast after careful risk assessment and counselling with healthcare professionals and religious leaders, who help the individual make an informed decision [5]. Fasting may place patients who are on antidiabetic medications at higher risk of hypoglycemia and associated complications. Furthermore, in special populations like pregnant individuals, elderly people, persons with concomitant diseases, and those with renal and hepatic impairment, the risk of complications may increase if proper care is not taken. Therefore, a patient-centered approach including diet plan and dose modification/omission with careful monitoring during fasting period may reduce the complications in patients with diabetes. Fasting may have different connotations in different religions. It does not necessarily mean to abstain from food. For example, in the Jain religion, many eat the last meal before sunset and is considered a form of prayer. Similarly in Ramadan, one who cannot fast can feed the needy to offer prayer. Depending on the degree of abstinence from food, fasts may be classified as follows:<table-wrap id="Tabh"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Type of fast</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; Complete fasting: giving up food and water completely for a period</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Partial fasting: eating less than you need to avoid hunger</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Limiting the number of food items eaten</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Giving up favorite foods</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par1786">However, it should be noted that almost all religions provide special concessions to believers who are ill, travelling, or unable to keep fasts due to some reason or the other.</p></sec><sec id="Sec169"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1787">Based on the following factors, the glucose-lowering therapy/strategy during fasting period may be modified/altered.<table-wrap id="Tabi"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Fasting</th><th>Glucose-lowering therapy</th><th>Individual phenotype</th><th>Patient characteristics</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; Duration of fast<break/>&#x02022; Restriction of fluids/solids: absolute/partial<break/>&#x02022; Frequency of fast (once weekly/once monthly/once yearly/others)</td><td><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Potential for hypoglycemia<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Potential for dehydration<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Potential for gastrointestinal upset<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Duration of action</td><td><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Risk of hypoglycemia<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Risk of hypoglycemia unawareness<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Ability to self-monitor blood glucose</td><td><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Pregnancy<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Elderly<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Concomitant diseases<break/><bold>&#x02022;</bold> Adolescent and children</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec170"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar51"><title><italic>Pre fast counselling/assessment/education</italic></title><p id="Par1788">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1789">Discussion about fasting should be initiated prior to the fast. This should include the potential discomforts and risks of fasting and means of mitigating them. The person&#x02019;s exact perspective of fasting, including duration of fast, allowance for liquids and snacks during the day, acceptance of sublingual foods, and freedom to break the fast in case of significant discomfort, must be clarified [1].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1790">Prefast assessment comprises comprehensive history taking, physical examination, and investigations aimed at identifying stigmata of target organ damage, so that strategies can be made to optimize health during fasts [6]. Prefast counselling should include appropriate diabetes education, self-management practices, and hypoglycemia awareness training [7].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1791">An observational study including Indian patients reports that the knowledge of diabetes during the period of Ramadan among the Muslims was only 58.5 and 37.3% patients did not monitor their blood glucose levels in the previous Ramadan [8].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1792">Concerned physician, pharmacist, and health workers have great role in providing education and making awareness regarding the management of diabetes during fasting [9, 10].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1793">Factors that may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, and dehydration must be noted [11, 12]. The concept of shared decision-making and person-centeredness must be followed, in letter and in spirit while considering whether a particular individual can fast safely or not [13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1794">A structured diabetes educational program should be given to the patients and their families, which gives information on risk quantification, physical activity, glucose monitoring, diet, hypoglycemia, dosage and timing of medications, and identification of the symptoms of complications [5].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1795">Evidence suggested that structured education program was associated with significantly less weight gain (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and hypoglycemic episodes (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) with reduced risk of acute complications compared to those who were not educated during fasting [14, 15].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1796">A study including 774 diabetes patients report that those who received individualized education were more likely to modify their diabetes treatment plan during Ramadan (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), to perform SMBG at least twice daily during Ramadan (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), and to have improved knowledge about hypoglycemic signs and symptoms (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0007). Moreover, BMI (&#x02212;&#x02009;1.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.4 vs &#x02212;&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and A1C (&#x02212;&#x02009;0.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1 vs&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) significantly reduced in these patients during Ramadan compared with who received usual care [16].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1797">SMBG should be considered as an important tool that helps both patients and physicians to practice safe decision-making regarding drug dosage and other aspects of management [17]. Evidence suggests that among patients with T2DM, an increase in frequency of SMBG was associated with better glycemic control in those who were on insulin and were able to adjust their regimen [18, 19]. Furthermore, Ramadan education and awareness in diabetes (READ) program including regular glucose monitoring report significantly less episodes of hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients with T2DM [14].</p></list-item></list>

Therefore, complex carbohydrates like whole grains, potato, berries, citrus fruits, apple, nuts, and legumes at prefasting and simple carbohydrates like bread, cereals, rice, and pasta at postfasting may be more appropriate to reduce complications [1, 5].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1801">Diet during Ramadan should be individualized by balancing patient risk and adequacy of glycemic control. The Epidemiology of Diabetes and Ramadan (EPIDIAR) study reports that around 15&#x02013;30% of the patients with diabetes either gain or lose their body weight during Ramadan period [21].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1802">Moderate to highly vigorous exercise should not be performed during fasting.

</p></sec><sec id="FPar53"><title><italic>Religious fasts</italic></title><p id="Par1803">Though several guidelines are available for different aspects of diabetes care, fasting in diabetes poses a unique challenge [4, 23]. Designing randomized controlled trails to address the issues related to fasting in patients with diabetes is particularly difficult. Therefore, understanding the physiology of fasting and linking it to pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of diabetes are required to design strategies for glycemic management during fasting [24]. We summarize different religious fasts commonly observed in India that can have significant impact on metabolic and glycemic health in diabetes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1804"><italic>Ramadan fasting</italic>: It is a principle ritual followed by Muslims during the sacred month of Ramadan (the ninth lunar month of Islamic/Hijri calendar) [5, 23]. During this month, all healthy adult Muslims abstain from food, drinks, and medication from dawn to dusk (sunset). Believers usually eat two times, one before dawn (Suhur) and one after sunset (Iftar). Hypoglycemia and dehydration are major complications associated with fasting though hyperglycemia may occur, due to overindulgence in food during the two main meals of Suhur and Iftar [25, 26]. Therefore, prefast risk stratification followed by a treatment tailored to individual needs appears to be the best management strategy. In addition, structured education enables patients to self-manage their condition better [5, 27].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1805"><italic>Jain fasts</italic>: There are two sects in the Jain religion, the Shwetambers and the Digambers. The fasts are similar in both sects, except for the duration of fasting during the pious month of Paryushana 8&#x000a0;days for the Shwetamber sect and 10&#x000a0;days for the Digamber sect. Jains usually fast from dusk to dawn, unlike Hindu fasting which extends from dawn to moon-rise [1, 3].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1806"><italic>Hindu fasts</italic>: Though not mandatory, most of the Hindus observe day-long and week-long fasts. Karva Chauth, Guru Purnima, Ekadashi, Makar Sakranti, and Holi Ashtami are some of the annual, monthly, and weekly fasts observed as part of various vows. During Navratras, which occur twice a year, Hindus observe longer fasts for a period of 9&#x000a0;days usually from dawn to moon-rise/star-rise. The day-long nature of Hindu fasts however makes it distinct from the month-long fasts of Ramadan and Buddhist Lent. Unlike in Islam, there are no universal rules laid down for Hindu fasts, and therefore data on metabolic effect of these fasts is scanty so far [1, 12].</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="FPar54"><title>Pharmacological management</title><p id="Par1807">
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1808">Metformin can be used safely in patients with diabetes during fasting due to minimal incidences of hypoglycemia; however, once daily dosing needs to be adjusted or modified to avoid complications [5].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1809">Newer generation sulfonylureas (gliclazide MR and glimepiride) should be preferred over older, long-acting sulfonylureas like glibenclamide and chlorpropamide during Ramadan fasting, as they are relatively more safe and economical [4, 5, 27].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1810">Pioglitazone was found to be safe and efficacious in lowering blood glucose in fasting subjects during Ramadan in combination with other antidiabetic agents [28].

However, LIRA-Ramadan trial did not report any significant difference between liraglutide and sulfonylureas in terms of severe hypoglycemia (23.7 vs 20.9%), although weight loss (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0091) and A1C reduction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) were significant in liraglutide group [34]. This suggests that liraglutide may be considered an effective therapy in combination with metformin during Ramadan.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1815">SGLT2 inhibitors may be used during fasting, in view of their low risk of hypoglycemia. However, the potential risk of dehydration must be taken into account.

However, postural hypotension was greater in the dapagliflozin group but did not reach significance [35].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec175"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par1888">Patients with T2DM are always at higher risk for several CVDs such as CAD, CHF, stroke, PAD, and cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, compared to non-diabetes patients, T2DM patients have a considerably higher risk of CV morbidity and mortality [1]. In addition, the coexistence of risk factors like hypertension, abnormal cholesterol, high triglycerides, obesity, and smoking with T2DM may increase the burden and complications of CVD [2]. In India, CVD attributes to nearly 25% of all deaths. Furthermore, according to the Global Burden of Disease study, age-standardized CVD mortality rate was 272 per 100,000 population in India, which was higher than the global average of 235 per 100,000 population [3]. An Indian population-based study evaluated the prevalence of CVD risk factors in 6198 T2DM patients. A study reports that compared to participants with diabetes vs those without it, prevalence of hypertension was 73.1% (95% CI, 67.2 to 75.0) vs 26.5% (25.2 to 27.8), hypercholesterolemia was 41.4% (38.3 to 44.5) vs 14.7% (13.7 to 15.7), hypertriglyceridemia was 71.0% (68.1 to 73.8) vs 30.2% (28.8 to 31.5), low HDL-C was 78.5% (75.9 to 80.1) vs 37.1% (35.7 to 38.5), and incidence of smoking/smokeless tobacco use was 26.6% (23.8 to 29.4) vs 14.4% (13.4 to 15.4; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [4]. In CINDI study, risk factors for macrovascular complications including hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia were observed in 23.3, 26, and 27% of patients, respectively, and ischemic heart disease was seen in 6% of patients [5]. Furthermore, in the CINDI 2 study carried out later, CV risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;23&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and smoking were prevalent in 27.6, 62.4, 84.2, and 24% patients, respectively [6]. In addition, ischemic heart disease, PVD, and stroke were found in 0.7, 2, and 1% patients, respectively. Statin therapy was required in 95.3% of the patients. Moreover, history of diabetes was significantly associated with MI (OR, 2.37, PAR 9.9%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and stroke (OR, 1.16, 1.05&#x02013;1.30; 3.9%, 1.9&#x02013;7.6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) in the effect of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with MI in 52 countries (INTERHEART) study and INTERSTROKE studies respectively [7, 8]. CAD and stroke constitute the majority of CVD mortality in India (83%), with CAD being predominant [9]. Therefore, aggressive controlling of these risk factors may delay or reduce the incidence of CVDs in T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec176"><title><bold>Considerations</bold></title><p id="Par1889">When framing recommendations for diabetes and CV risk, following factors should be reviewed: hypertension, smoking, obesity, increased fasting insulin and IR, lifestyle intervention, and atherogenic lipid profile (abnormal cholesterol, high triglycerides).</p><p id="Par1890">Primary prevention of CVDs aims at preventing patients from the event of CAD/CVD. This includes engaging in moderate physical activity, maintaining normal body weight, limiting alcohol consumption, reducing sodium intake, maintaining adequate intake of potassium, and consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and less saturated and total fat. Secondary prevention of CVDs in patients with diabetes plans to reduce the mortality and morbidity and prevent the repeated CVD event. This comprises treatment with aspirin, &#x003b2;-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statin. The tertiary prevention intends at rehabilitation, preventing complications, and improving QoL. This can be achieved with some interventional surgical procedures. Quaternary prevention targets at preventing overdiagnosis, overmedicalization, overlabelling, and overtreatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec177"><title><bold>Rationale and evidence</bold></title><sec id="FPar55"><title><italic>Identification</italic></title><p id="Par1891">Cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, family history of premature coronary disease, and the presence of albuminuria should be assessed at least annually in all patients with T2DM [2]. Even the CINDI and CINDI 2 studies on Indian population suggest for the screening of CV complications at the time of diagnosis itself [5, 6].</p><p id="Par1892">The following tools have been used by several physicians for assessment of the CVD risk in individuals with diabetes and CVD:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par1893">FRS [10]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1894">QRISK Risk Score [11]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1895">IDRS [12]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1896">UKPDS Risk Engine [13]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1897">SCORE tables [14]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1898">WHO risk prediction charts [15]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1899">American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk calculator [16]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1900">The 3rd Joint British Societies&#x02019; risk calculator (JBS) [17]</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par1901">A cross-sectional study from India including 1007 participants reports that FRS was not able to differentiate the study participants properly with respect to CVD risk. However, the IDRS was found to produce better discriminatory performances in the study population [10]. In addition, IDRS can predict CV and diabetic risk more effectively than FRS and serve as simple and cost-effective tool for a primary care physician to identify at risk individuals for diabetes and CVD in Asian Indian women [12]. In another cross-sectional study, 900 participants were examined for CVD risk with WHO-ISH risk prediction chart. This study concluded that the WHO-ISH 10-year risk prediction chart was easier for assessing the CVD risk factors and risk grouping and could also be used to predict their 10-year risk of stroke or MI [18]. Furthermore, a prospective study reports that Indian patients presenting with acute MI and JBS risk score are likely to identify the largest proportion of the patients as at &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; as compared to WHO, FRS, and ACC/AHA [19].</p></sec><sec id="FPar56"><title><bold><italic>Management</italic></bold></title><p id="Par1902">

Furthermore, close monitoring and maintaining recommended targets for BP (130/80&#x000a0;mmHg), lipid control (LDL &#x0003c;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;mg/dL), and glycemia (A1C &#x0003c;&#x02009;7%) are important for the prevention of CVD in patients with T2DM [14, 20]. In addition, physical exercise, weight control, lifestyle modification with changing food habits, and cessation of smoking also prevent the CVD risk in T2DM patients [20].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1904"><italic>Diet</italic>: Substitution of dietary saturated fat with PUFAs is reported to be associated with improved CV outcomes. Several foods like oats, nuts, psyllium husk, cinnamon, flaxseeds, fenugreek, soy, amla, garlic, finger millet, and white marudah were also reported to have lipid-lowering property [21]. Moreover, American Family Physicians (AFP) advocates that the Mediterranean diet can reduce CV mortality and the DASH eating plan associates with a reduced risk of CAD [22]. Moreover, the following dietary adaptations can be made to lessen the development of CVDs in T2DM patients: reductions in caloric intake (by 500 to 800&#x000a0;kcal/day), total fat intake (especially saturated fat) and food portion sizes, increased consumption of dietary fiber, and moderate alcohol use <bold>[</bold>23].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1905"><italic>Physical activity</italic>: It is an independent and protective risk factor associated with reduced CV morbidity and mortality (OR, 0.86; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), and physical inactivity accounts for 12.2% of the population-attributable risk for acute MI and 6% of CAD with an estimated 0.68-year reduction in life expectancy [22]. The exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is the cornerstone for secondary prevention of CVD. CR is associated with a 13 and 26% lower all-cause and CVD mortality respectively and a 31% reduction in hospital admissions at 12&#x000a0;months in patients with CAD [22]. Hence, AFP recommend that physical activity for adults should be at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, 75&#x000a0;min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, or an equivalent combination [24].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1906"><italic>Yoga</italic>: A randomized parallel study in India compared efficacy of yoga in addition to OADs.

Most notably, the INTERHEART and INTERSTROKE studies report that psychological factors have a strong effect towards MI (OR, 2.67; PAR, 32.5%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and ischemic stroke (OR, 2.20, 1.78&#x02013;2.72; 17.4%, 13.1&#x02013;22&#x000b7;6), respectively [7, 8]. In an RCT, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had a 41% lower rate of fatal and non-fatal first recurrent CVD events (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42,0.83; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), 45% fewer recurrent acute MI (0.55, 0.36&#x02013;0.85; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007), and a non-significant 28% lower all-cause mortality (0.72, 0.40&#x02013;1.30; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28) than the reference group after adjustment for other outcome-affecting variables during a mean 94&#x000a0;months of follow-up period [30].

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1911">Aspirin is widely used for secondary prevention of CVD; however; its use in primary prevention is still controversial [2]. A meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD in T2DM patients. Study reports that low dose aspirin (75&#x000a0;mg/day) was allied with a reduction of MI and stroke among women with diabetes. Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated 35% reduction in MI among men (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.82; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), but the results were not significant in women (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.14; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.37) [32]. However, a systemic review including 10 RCTs reports no CVD benefit and trials with diabetes subgroup analyses also showed any effect [33]. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis evaluated aspirin for primary prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes and reported no difference with respect to the risk of all-cause mortality (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81&#x02013;1.06), individual atherosclerotic events, bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemorrhagic stroke rates compared to placebo [34]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4000) by the Antithrombotic Trialists&#x02019; (ATT) collaborators showed that the effects of aspirin on major vascular events were similar for patients with or without diabetes: RR 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67&#x02013;1.15) and RR 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79&#x02013;0.96), respectively [35].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1912">In patients with aspirin intolerance/allergy or patients at very high risk for CVD, clopidogrel is recommended [2, 36].

Furthermore, fibrates may be added if triglycerides remain &#x0003e;&#x02009;200&#x000a0;mg/dL in patients receiving statin therapy [20]. Statins reported a significant benefit in CV risk reduction and showed significant primary and secondary prevention of CVD/CAD deaths in patients with diabetes [39&#x02013;41].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1917">A recent meta-analysis investigating 4351 diabetes patients reports that compared with placebo, standard dose statin treatment resulted in a significant RRR of 15% in the occurrence of any major CV or cerebrovascular event (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79&#x02013;0.91). Compared with standard dose statin treatment (simvastatin 20&#x000a0;mg, pravastatin 40&#x000a0;mg, or atorvastatin 10&#x000a0;mg), intensive-dose statin (simvastatin 80&#x000a0;mg or atorvastatin 80&#x000a0;mg) treatment resulted in an additional 9% RRR [42].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1918">Moreover, statins were reported to produce similar results in various studies in India [43, 44]. Evidence advocates atorvastatin has negligible or no ability to increase HDL-C, which is the key feature in patients with diabetes. Thus, other statins should probably be preferred to atorvastatin in patients with diabetes/MS [45].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1919">In addition, ADA recommend that either high intensity or moderate intensity statin therapy should be used together with lifestyle intervention according to patient age and ASCVD risk factors [2]. The details have been given in Annexure XVI. The Lipid Association of India expert consensus statement 2016 revealed that statin therapy is highly effective in lowering NHDL&#x02011;C, LDL&#x02011;C, apolipoprotein B, and remnant cholesterol, besides being remarkably safe [46]. Recent evidence shows a clear CVD benefit of lowering LDL-C with ezetimibe on top of a statin in patients with T2DM [47].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1920">Furthermore, in CAD/CAD risk-equivalent patients, ezetimibe addition onto simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin provided greater LDL-C reductions and goal attainment than those who up-titrated these statin therapies [48]. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study assessed the effect of fenofibrate on CV events in T2DM patients. Fenofibrate reduced total CV events, mainly due to fewer non-fatal MI and revascularizations but did not significantly reduce the risk of coronary events such as CAD death or non-fatal MI [49].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1921">Furthermore, USFDA states that the current evidence base is insufficient to support fibrates for CVD protection and that more trial evidence is needed [50]. Nonetheless, prescribing lipid-lowering agents in older people with T2DM (&#x0003e;&#x02009;85&#x000a0;years) requires special consideration because exposure to higher doses (or higher potency) might increase the risk of adverse effects instead of improving life expectancy.</p></list-item></list>

A meta-analysis including large, long-term prospective RCTs (such as the UKPDS, the prospective pioglitazone clinical trial in macrovascular events [PROactive], the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE] trial, the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial [VADT], and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD] trial) reports that intensive glycemic control was associated with 17% reduction in events of non-fatal MI (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75&#x02013;0.93) and a 15% reduction in events of CAD (OR, 0.85; 0.77&#x02013;0.93); however, the study did not find any significant effect on events of stroke (0.93, 0.81&#x02013;1.06) or all-cause mortality (1.02, 0.87&#x02013;1.19) [51].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1924">In a meta-analysis of 301 clinical trials, the CVD risk of all glucose-lowering drugs including metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP4 inhibitor, AGI, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 analogue, meglitinides, and insulins was evaluated. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the association between any of the nine glucose-lowering drugs alone or in combination and risk of CV mortality [52].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1925">Two SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, were recently shown to provide CV benefits in patients with T2DM. Empagliflozin was reported to produce substantial reductions in CVD death (by 38%) and all-cause mortality (by 32%), as well as in hospitalization for HF (by 35%), as compared with standard care in EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [53]. In the recently published CANVAS trial, canagliflozin significantly reduced the composite of death from CV causes, non-fatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for non-inferiority; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 for superiority) in T2DM patients with established CVD or at high risk for CV events [54].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par1926">Similarly in LEADER trial, liraglutide 1.8&#x000a0;mg daily was associated with lower rates (patients) of death from CV causes (4.7 vs 6.0%; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) or any causes (8.2 vs 9.6%; HR, 0.85; 0.74 to 0.97; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) compared to placebo in patients with T2DM [55].

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par1935">Karma, an ancient term, suggests that right action with right intention consequently provides a right outcome in a persons&#x02019; life. This is also proved in the field of diabetes through STENO-2, EMPA-REG, and LEADER trials. Recent results of STENO-2 trial after 21&#x000a0;years follow-up report that an intensive, multifactorial intervention including ACE inhibitors/ARBs demonstrated a median of 7.9&#x000a0;years of gain of life in patients with T2DM [65]. The choice of individual agent for a person with diabetes may be influenced by a number of factors including their risk profile (CV, renal, end-organ damage), preferences, and previous experience of therapy, as well as costs. Moreover, a good karma may pass on to the unborn offspring of a pregnant mother with diabetes and also benefits the physician [66].</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec183"><title><bold>Preamble</bold></title><p id="Par2019">Hypoglycemia is a major cause of concern with some antidiabetic drugs during the course of glycemic management in patients with T2DM [1]. However, the extent of hypoglycemia varies with different antidiabetic drugs pertaining to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The International Hypoglycemia Study Group categorizes hypoglycemia into three categories basing upon the glycemic criteria [2].<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par2020">Glucose alert value (level 1): &#x0003c;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;mg/dL (3.9&#x000a0;mmol/L)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2021">Clinically significant hypoglycemia (level 2): &#x0003c;&#x02009;54&#x000a0;mg/dL (3.0&#x000a0;mmol/L)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2022">Severe hypoglycemia (level 3): no specific glucose threshold</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par2023">The prevalence of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM in India is quite high. A recent cross-sectional study reports that nearly 96% of patients (out of 366 patients) were associated with at least one or other symptoms of hypoglycemia (dizziness, weakness). Furthermore, patients taking insulin in addition to OADs were at higher risk than patient taking OADs alone (OR, 2.3; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [3]. Meanwhile, another cross-sectional study including 1650 subjects from South India revealed that the cumulative incidence of institutional hypoglycemia was 12.36%; among which, 26.96% had asymptomatic episodes [4]. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to several diabetes-related short- and long-term complications such as precipitation of acute cerebrovascular disease, MI, neurocognitive dysfunction, retinal cell death, and loss of vision [5] and may lead to coma or death if not reversed [1]. The ACCORD and ADVANCE trial and other evidences report that severe hypoglycemia was directly associated with mortality in patients with T2DM [6&#x02013;8]. Furthermore, <italic>Kalra et al</italic>. stated that diabetes patients with severe hypoglycemia are associated with sixfold increase in deaths over those not experiencing it [5]. Therefore, urgent steps need to be taken with some corrective measures against hypoglycemia in T2DM patients to minimize the burden. Following are some of the causes and risk factors of hypoglycemia [5].<table-wrap id="Tabj"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Causes and risk factors for hypoglycemia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Causes</td><td>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par2037">Prevention of hypoglycemia is preferable than treatment, as it is much more likely to avoid severe events and economic burden [9]. Hypoglycemia prevention requires a combined effort from physician as well as patient. Patient education, patient counselling, and continuous blood glucose monitoring are the critical factors that need to be considered for the prevention of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. Evidence suggests that a proper and structured diabetes education helps in reducing diabetic complications including hypoglycemia [10&#x02013;13].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2038">Furthermore, interventions targeting health beliefs and attitudes about hypoglycemia and diabetes self-management can be more effective than knowledge-centered patient education, which focuses on &#x0201c;symptom perception&#x0201d; in reducing hypoglycemia unawareness [5]. Patients receiving insulin for the treatment of T2DM can be benefitted by adjusting insulin doses following SMBG procedure [5, 14]. In addition, a cross-sectional study from India reports that 85% of patients were taking timely meals to prevent hypoglycemia [3]. Stratifying patients according to age and avoiding very tight glucose control in elderly patients (&#x0003e;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;years) and very young children &#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years of age will help to prevent hypoglycemia in these high-risk people.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par2040">Majority of the antidiabetic agents can produce hypoglycemia; however, the intensity depends upon their mechanism of action. Insulin, sulfonylureas, and meglitinides due to their glucose-independent mechanism of action cause a high risk of hypoglycemia [5].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2041">The UK Hypoglycemia Study Group report that the incidence of severe hypoglycemia increased from 7 to 25% in patients treated with insulin for &#x0003c;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years with those treated for &#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years [15]. However, modern insulin analogues report lower incidence of hypoglycemia than traditional human insulins [16&#x02013;18].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2042">Among all sulfonylureas, modern sulfonylureas like gliclazide MR and glimepiride are associated with lesser hypoglycemic episodes [19, 20]. Meglitinides were reported to inflict high rates of hypoglycemia [21]. In special situations like elderly, fasting, metabolic disorders, and pregnancy, the dose of these drugs should be adjusted or modified to avoid further complications. Furthermore, avoid/reduce the dose of insulin in people with CKD who have a tendency to develop hypoglycemia.</p></list-item></list>
