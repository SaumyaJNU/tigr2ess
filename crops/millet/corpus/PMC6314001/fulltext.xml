Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) reached alarming levels with the emergence of strains that are virtually untreatable with the existing drugs [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is a serious determinant of treatment success. Therefore, to advance a treatment achievement, the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) drug susceptibility patterns in community-based care should be determined <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. DR-TB, particularly multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensive drug-resistant-TB, have become the most important public health problem in many countries [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using molecular techniques such as spoligotyping, DNA fingerprinting <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and variable number of tandem repeats together with drug susceptibility test is recommended to determine the MTB strains circulating in the community and their drug susceptibility profile <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Spoligotyping is used to cluster MTB strains into different lineages such as Beijing, Ural, Haarlem, East African-Indian (EAI), Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM), Central-Asian or Delhi (CAS), T and Orphan and they are the most known families circulating in the world [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These studies indicated that drug resistant strains are found in all families of MTB identified by spoligotyping method, i.e. Beijing, Ural, EAI, LAM, T, CAS, Orphan, MANU, Haarlem and other new strains. However, the rate of drug resistance developed in these strains is not well studied. Rifampicin resistance MTB strains make a treatment complicated because it is the elements of both MDR and extensively drug resistance and thus it is the key indicator for MDR tuberculosis [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
