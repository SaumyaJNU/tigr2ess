    "Introduction:Antitubercular drug resistance strain is a horrifying barrier to effective TB treatment and prevention. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of rifampicin-resistance M. tuberculosis (MTB) strains. Methods:We searched two electronic databases, PubMed and EMBASE, until 26 March 2017 and updated our search on 27 April 2018 and accessed all prevalence studies of MTB strain and their drug susceptibility patterns to rifampicin. The pooled prevalence estimate was determined using random effects model. Results:We identified 23 studies satisfying the inclusion criteria. The proportion of rifampicin resistance strains was diverged depending on the type of strains, country and Regions. The pooled estimate of rifampicin-resistance strains of MTB for the included studies was 4% (95% CI: 3-5%). In subgroup analysis based on World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, the pooled estimate of rifampicin-resistance strains of MTB was 11% (95% CI: 9-13%) with the Western Pacific Region 24%, Europian Region 10%, South-East Asian Region 6%, African Region 3% and Region of American 1%. Beijing family was the most dominant strain resistance to rifampicin with pooled prevalence of 14% (95% CI: 10-18%). The pooled prevalence of other families, i.e. EAI, T, CAS, MANU, Haarlem, LAM and Ural, was â‰¤2% for each. Conclusion:High burden of rifampicin resistance MTB strains was identified in the Western Pacific Region. Of these, Beijing family was predominantly resistance to rifampicin in Western Pacific Region and South-East Asian Region and also spread to European Region and Region of American."
