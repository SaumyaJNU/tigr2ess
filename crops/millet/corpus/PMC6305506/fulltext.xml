human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those receiving allografts [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently, it has been
reported that there is an increased risk of toxoplasmosis in human patients with cancer who
are undergoing chemotherapy [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Toxoplasmosis in patients with cancer has most commonly been reported
in association with hematological tumors [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the
case of a patient with toxoplasmosis infection resembling melanoma metastasis has recently
been reported [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, toxoplasmosis in
cats, which are known to be the definitive host for <italic>T. gondii</italic>, has most
commonly been described in association with immunocompetent kittens and immunodeficient
FIV-positive adult cats [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, immunocompetent adult cats that were immunosuppressed by
administration of glucocorticoids [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine
for the treatment of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) or eosinophilic granuloma, or
after renal transplantation, were also reported to be at increased risk for developing
toxoplasmosis [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, toxoplasmosis due to chemotherapy has not been reported in veterinary
medicine. In this case report, we describe a cat undergoing treatment with chemotherapy for
nasal lymphoma, who presented with pulmonary toxoplasmosis that resembled multiple lung
metastases.</p><p>An 11-year-old, male, neutered, domestic shorthair cat weighing 4.2 kg presented to the
Animal Medical Center at Gifu University with a complaint of a 6-month history of right-sided
nasal discharge and lacrimation that did not respond to antibiotic treatment. Upon admission,
the cat was febrile (40.2&#x000b0;C) and stuporous due to more than 10 episodes of tonic-clonic
seizures, each lasting 2&#x02212;3 min. Laboratory results of the complete blood count (CBC) and serum
biochemical analysis, including BUN (20.9 mg/d<italic>l</italic>, reference interval [RI]:
17.6&#x02212;32.8 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and creatinine (1.1 mg/d<italic>l</italic>, RI: 0.8&#x02212;1.8
mg/d<italic>l</italic>) levels, were initially within the reference limits, with the
exception of total protein levels (8.6 g/d<italic>l</italic>, RI: 5.7&#x02212;7.8
mg/d<italic>l</italic>). Serological tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
antibodies and feline leukemia virus antigen were negative. Computed tomography (CT) imaging

bulb, with erosion of the cribriform plate (D).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-80-1881-g001"/></fig>) revealed that an intranasal tumor had invaded the olfactory bulb; intranasal lymphoma
was diagnosed after a full examination and histological analysis. The cat then underwent
chemoradiotherapy with a (CHOP)-based protocol that included cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone, in conjunction with hypofractionated radiation therapy for the
intranasal lesion (total radiation dose: 41.3 Gy). The cat showed clinical improvement with
increased appetite, and no seizures were observed after commencing treatment. On day 39 from
the initial visit, the owner of the cat claimed that the cat&#x02019;s appetite had again decreased,
and CT imaging was repeated to reevaluate the treatment response. A head CT scan revealed
intranasal tumor regression, although pulmonary nodules were observed by chest CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Series of multiplanar reconstructed transverse computed tomography images of the thorax

feeding vessel and a peripheral wedge-shaped. The CT values of the nodule were ranged
22-125 HU (Hounsfield Unit). The number and size of the lesions were also increased.
Furthermore, a diffuse ground-glass appearance was noted on day 53. (C) The mass had
shrunk (0.6 &#x000d7; 0.5 &#x000d7; 0.6 cm) and the ground-glass appearance had diminished by day 74,

were found in the left. Larger nodules were detected in the right cranial lobe (14.7 mm in
diameter), middle lobe (2.9 mm), and caudal lobe (3.9 mm), and a 4.8-mm nodule was detected in
the left caudal lobe. On day 53, a chest CT scan revealed that the nodules had enlarged to
15.7, 4.9, and 9.0 mm in the right pulmonary lobe, respectively, and to 12.6 mm in the left
caudal lobe. The millet grain-sized nodules had also increased in number; there were now 20
nodules spread throughout the right pulmonary lobes and eight nodules throughout the left
lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). At this time, the cat also began to
demonstrate tachypnea.</p><p>Cytological analysis of the CT-guided needle aspirate obtained from the lung nodules revealed
granulomatous inflammation caused by protozoal organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Fine-needle aspirates of the pulmonary mass in an 11-year-old male cat. A cyst that

macrophages using Hemacolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> rapid blood smear stain (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany). Large, round pseudocysts containing numerous organisms were observed within the
macrophages. The organisms within the pseudocysts were oval to crescent-shaped, with a nucleus
located in the broader end. The extracellular organisms were crescent-shaped, with a lightly
basophilic cytoplasm, and a central metachromatic nucleus, which resembled <italic>Toxoplasma
gondii</italic> tachyzoites. A diagnosis of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection was made
based on cytological findings from a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of one of the lung nodules.
This diagnosis was made primarily based on the size and shape of the cyst and the presence of
numerous crescent-shaped extracellular organisms.</p><p>Fecal examination was performed, but no <italic>T. gondii</italic> oocysts were shed in the
cat feces. Subsequently, the serum of the cat was subjected to a latex agglutination test, and
the FNA samples were subjected to molecular analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
<italic>in vitro</italic> parasite culture, and genotyping.</p><p>A latex agglutination test (Toxo Test-MT) was performed following the procedures recommended
by the manufacturer (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The test was positive for
samples serially diluted from 1:16 to 1:256, indicating high antibody levels in the serum of
the cat (positive reaction &#x02265;64). After the cat of this case was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis,
similar testing was performed on the serum of the other cats who lived together in the same
home with the two families. All the cats, except for the mother of the cat in the present
case, had been housed indoors all of their lives. The test was seropositive (positive reaction
detected in samples serially diluted at 1:64 and 1:256, respectively) in two of the 11 cats.
Seropositive results were obtained from one littermate of the cat of the present study and one
cat from the other family.</p><p>For PCR analysis, DNA was extracted from the CT-guided FNA sample using the EZNA Tissue DNA
Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, U.S.A.), and following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.
After extraction, PCR that targeted <italic>T. gondii-</italic>specific B1 gene was performed,
as described by Z&#x000f6;ller <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
DNA from the <italic>T. gondii</italic> PLK strain was used as a positive control, and
distilled water was used as a negative control. The PCR amplification product was detected as
expected, and the negative controls remained free of amplified products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Polymerase chain reaction analysis of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> B1 gene in an

cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum; the cells were incubated at
37&#x000b0;C and under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cell culture medium was exchanged once a week until
parasites were visually confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy. Genotyping was performed on
DNA extracted from the <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite culture as described by Su
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Results revealed a type
III haplotype, as estimated by RAxML version 8.5, using the GTR + I + &#x00393; model [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>These cytopathological findings, together, with the results of the molecular analysis, were
consistent with the histological findings of granulomatous inflammation in the lung nodules
caused by a <italic>T. gondii</italic> genotype III strain. Immediately following diagnosis
and the cessation of chemotherapy for nasal lymphoma, treatment for toxoplasmosis was started,
and the cat was prescribed clindamycin hydrochloride, orally (12 mg/kg, P.O., q 12 h) [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. By the end of the following month, the cat began
demonstrating partial clinical improvement, which included the return of appetite and the
cessation of tachypnea; however, the cat progressively lost weight and displayed increasing
weakness, despite a reduction in the size of the lung nodules on CT imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2C</xref>). On day 74, the cat developed abdominal
distention. Hematological analysis identified mild anemia (Hct: 27%) and serum biochemical
analysis revealed several abnormalities, including increased BUN (153.1
mg/d<italic>l</italic>) and creatinine (4.7 mg/d<italic>l</italic>) levels. An abdominal
ultrasonographic examination revealed markedly enlarged, hyperechoic, and irregularly shaped
regions in both kidneys (right; 6.4 cm, left; 4.7 cm in diameter); using ultrasound-guided
FNA, the hyperechoic areas were confirmed to be lymphoma infiltration. CHOP-based chemotherapy
was re-initiated, together, with clindamycin hydrochloride; however, the cat died on day
87.</p><p>Postmortem examination was performed one day after the death of the cat, and revealed the
presence of five small gray foci in the lung lobes, as well as an enlarged tan-colored kidney
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5A</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_005" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Gross findings and immunohistochemistry of the kidney. (A) Photograph obtained at the

CD20-positive and CD3-negative, atypical lymphoblastic lymphoid neoplastic cells had
predominantly infiltrated the cortexes of both kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref>). No <italic>T. gondii</italic> organisms were found in any organs,
including the lung nodules, kidneys, and central nervous system. This was confirmed after
immunohistochemistry was performed with two types of anti-<italic>T. gondii</italic>
antibodies, as described previously [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of CT-guided FNA samples obtained from the lung nodules, confirmed a diagnosis of
<italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Occasionally, multiple proliferating nodules in the
lungs are interpreted as metastatic nodules based on the radiographic or CT appearance in
patients with a primary tumor. In addition, primary and metastatic pulmonary nodules,
classified as solitary, well-demarcated nodules, have been described in cats with lymphoma
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, chemotherapy-resistant masses, as seen in the
current case, may be indicative of toxoplasmosis. Hence, it is important to establish an
accurate diagnosis of pulmonary masses/nodules. The utility of FNA cytopathology in dogs and
cats has previously been reported [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DeBerry <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the
diagnosis obtained from cytological and histopathological specimens of the lung were the same
in 82% of cases [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another study also reported that
the overall accuracy for diagnosis was 92% for both FNA and biopsy and that the sensitivity
for diagnosing the presence of neoplasia was 91% with FNA and 80% with biopsy [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These reports supported the high likelihood of making a
diagnosis of infectious agents in pulmonary masses.</p><p>Major complications secondary to FNA of the lung include asymptomatic pneumothorax,
hemoptysis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and death when using a large (18- to 21-gauge) needle;
however, the incidence of these complications is much less with the use of a smaller needle
(22- to 25-gauge) [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The needle used for FNA in our case was a 25-gauge, and no complications were
observed.</p><p>It is difficult to presume how the cat in this report became infected with <italic>T.
gondii</italic>, because the cat had B cell lymphoma. It is assumed that prednisone in the
CHOP-based protocol may have induced apoptosis of B and T lymphocytes, leading to
immunosuppression. Furthermore, cyclophosphamide is known to inhibit B lymphocyte
preferentially [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating
agent that has both potent immunosuppressive properties and antineoplastic activity, which
disrupts nucleic acid function by interfering with DNA replication and RNA transcription and
replication. Interestingly, Scerra <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that human patients
who were heavily treated with chemotherapy for aggressive B cell lymphoproliferative disease
were at higher risk for toxoplasmosis. It appears that chemoprophylaxis may be needed for
patients who are at high risk, such as those who have B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and
AIDS [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; this may also be needed for cats with B cell
lymphoma. They also described that mortality due to toxoplasmosis in hematologic malignancies
was high, and that untreated toxoplasmosis was lethal [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Kanakry <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the number of na&#x000ef;ve, potentially
alloreactive conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients who have undergone allogeneic
blood or marrow transplantation with cyclophosphamide treatment, was greatly reduced [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, administration of cyclophosphamide in mice
resulted in increased susceptibility to infection by a non-virulent <italic>T. gondii</italic>
strain as well as increased mortality rates [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The cat in our study received a single
cyclophosphamide treatment (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 47 mg/head) as part of the CHOP-based
chemotherapy; this cyclophosphamide administration may have facilitated <italic>T.
gondii</italic> infection and proliferation.</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> genotypes have been classified into three groups depending on
their pathogenicity in mice [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Types I and III
parasites displayed different virulence patterns in mice, with type I being highly virulent
and exhibiting a 100% lethal dose (LD<sub>100</sub>) profile in mice upon injection with 100
parasites. In contrast, type II exhibited low virulence (LD<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10<sup>3</sup>)
and type III was avirulent (LD<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup>) [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Little is known about the differences in infection and outcomes
between <italic>T. gondii</italic> genotypes in humans and cats [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, several studies have
reported that toxoplasmosis caused by type II strains dominate in human and feline [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In humans
and felines diagnosed with clinical toxoplasmosis, the percentage of those infected with type
III strains is reported to be 6.8&#x02013;20% and 0%, respectively [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The cat in this report died of lymphoma, as demonstrated by postmortem histopathological
examination, although <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection may have influenced the risk of
mortality. Chemotherapy may not be suspended when pulmonary toxoplasmosis is diagnosed, as it
may allow long-term remission of the lymphoma.</p><p>A latex agglutination assay was applied to detect <italic>T. gondii</italic> antibodies in
the cat serum in our study; thus, it is difficult to distinguish whether the cat in our case
suffered from a primary or reactivated infection. However, three of the 12 cats, including
this case, were positive for <italic>T. gondii</italic> antibodies, which may be a higher
positive rate than the reported seroprevalence in Tokyo, Japan [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This fact suggests that toxoplasmosis may be prevalent within the
household. This indicated that the cat might have suffered reactivation of a latent infection
acquired before the onset of lymphoma, which may have been vertically transmitted by nursing
or ingestion of oocysts during kittenhood. The fact that no oocysts were detected in the feces
also supports our theory that this was a reactivation of a latent infection; in general, cats
with <italic>T. gondii</italic> shed oocysts 1&#x02212;2 weeks after infection.</p><p>The anti-<italic>T. gondii</italic> IgG seroprevalence was significantly higher in cancer

gondii</italic> seroprevalence (60.94%) among cancer patients was found in lung cancer
patients [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to the findings in the case
reported here and in the report by Cong <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], immunocompetent cats with cancer, which are undergoing chemotherapy, may
be predisposed to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection just as in human patients.</p><p>Specific guidelines for toxoplasmosis treatment in human patients with hematological
malignancy are not fully formulated. Moreover, a useful strategy for treating toxoplasmosis in
cats undergoing chemotherapy has not yet been determined. Cats undergoing chemotherapy may
require prophylactic administration of antibiotics, as do AIDS patients.</p><p>The present case suggests that veterinary clinicians should be aware of pulmonary
toxoplasmosis to avoid the misdiagnosis of lung metastasis of the primary tumor. Toxoplasmosis
should be included as a differential diagnosis when considering chemotherapy-resistant masses
of the lung in tumor-bearing cats; this is imperative as toxoplasmosis may develop into
clinically severe disease.</p><sec id="s1"><title>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors declare that there were no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Clinical assessment of the case was performed at the Animal Medical Center
