    "Global efforts have seen the world's plant genetic resources (PGRs) conserved in about 1625 germ plasm repositories. Utility of these resources is important in increasing the resilience and productivity of agricultural production systems. However, despite their importance, utility of these resources has been poor. This article reviews the real and potential application of the current advances in genomic technologies in improving the utilization of these resources. The actual and potential application of these genomic approaches in plant identification, phylogenetic analysis, analysing the genetic value of germ plasm, facilitating germ plasm selection in genebanks as well as instilling confidence in international germ plasm exchange system is discussed. We note that if genebanks are to benefit from this genomic revolution, there is need for fundamental changes in the way genebanks are managed, perceived, organized and funded. Increased collaboration between genebank managers and the user community is also recommended."
