    "BACKGROUND:Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common food-related chronic disorders. It is mediated by the dietary consumption of prolamins, which are storage proteins of different grains. So far, no therapy exists and patients are bound to maintain a lifelong diet to avoid symptoms and long-term complications. To support those patients we developed a tandem single chain Fragment variable (tscFv) acting as a neutralizing agent against prolamins. We recombinantly produced this molecule in E. coli, but mainly obtained misfolded product aggregates, so-called inclusion bodies, independent of the cultivation strategy we applied. RESULTS:In this study, we introduce this novel tscFv against CD and present our strategy of obtaining active product from inclusion bodies. The refolded tscFv shows binding capabilities towards all tested CD-triggering grains. Compared to a standard polyclonal anti-PT-gliadin-IgY, the tscFv displays a slightly reduced affinity towards digested gliadin, but an additional affinity towards prolamins of barley. CONCLUSION:The high binding specificity of tscFv towards prolamin-containing grains makes this novel molecule a valuable candidate to support patients suffering from CD in the future."
