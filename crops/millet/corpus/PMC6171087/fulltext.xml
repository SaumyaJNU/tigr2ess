Experiments were set up with the selected wheat varieties in controlled environments as follows: (1) slowly progressing drought imposed on plants in soil, (2) rapid dehydration of whole plants grown in hydroponics, (3) dehydration of detached leaves, and (4) ABA treatment of whole plants grown in hydroponics. Representatives of two different families of transcription factors (TFs), <italic>TaDREB5</italic> and <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic>, were found to be linked to yield-under-drought using polymorphic Amplifluor-like SNP marker assays. qRT-PCR revealed differing patterns of expression of these genes in the leaves of plants subjected to the above treatments. Under drought, <italic>TaDREB5</italic> was significantly up-regulated in leaves of all high-yielding varieties tested and down-regulated in all low-yielding varieties, and the level of expression was independent of treatment type. In contrast, <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression levels showed different responses in the high- and low-yield groups of wheat varieties. <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression under dehydration (treatments 2 and 3) was higher than under drought (treatment 1) in all high-yielding varieties tested, while in all low-yielding varieties the opposite pattern was observed: the expression levels of this gene under drought were higher than under dehydration. Rapid dehydration of detached leaves and intact wheat plants grown in hydroponics produced similar changes in gene expression. ABA treatment of whole plants caused rapid stomatal closure and a rise in the transcript level of both genes during the first 30 min, which decreased 6 h after treatment. At this time-point, expression of <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> was again significantly up-regulated compared to untreated controls, while <italic>TaDREB5</italic> returned to its initial level of expression. These findings reveal significant differences in the transcriptional regulation of two drought-responsive and ABA-dependent TFs under slowly developing drought and rapid dehydration of wheat plants. The results obtained suggest that correlation between grain yield in dry conditions and <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression levels in the examined wheat varieties is dependent on the length of drought development and/or strength of drought; while in the case of <italic>TaDREB5</italic>, no such dependence is observed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ABA treatment</kwd><kwd>dehydration</kwd><kwd>drought</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>grain yield</kwd><kwd>qRT-PCR</kwd><kwd>stomatal conductance</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004561</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="69"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The two phenomena of drought and dehydration, sometimes considered synonymous, result when there is a shortfall in the amount of available soil or air moisture levels required to meet plant metabolic and transpirational demands. For the purpose of the current study, drought is defined as the relatively slow and gradual process of water withholding from the whole intact plant growing in soil or hydroponically. In contrast, dehydration refers to the removal of the whole plant from the soil or hydroponic medium, or the detachment of leaves, resulting in rapid water loss or &#x02018;dehydration shock.&#x02019; Despite the common basic cause, drought and dehydration have the obvious difference of whether active roots are present, which are able to transport water and solutes to upper parts of the plant, and participate in signaling. By this definition, drought-affected plants can often recover after re-watering, but for dehydrated plants removed from the root medium, or dehydrated detached leaves, the stress can be fatal.</p><p>Intact wheat plants growing in soil under drought maintain the typical signaling systems that provide cross-talk between plant organs by co-ordinated changes in the expression of hundreds or thousands of genes in different plant organs (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Stockinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mariaux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, rapid or &#x02018;shock-like&#x02019; dehydration of plants or detached leaves has been used to study the reaction of plant cells with no or minimal influence of signaling systems from other parts of the plant (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>). The early sensing of shock-like gene expression responses has also been examined in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Stockinger et al., 1997</xref>), resurrection plant species, <italic>Craterostigma plantagineum</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mariaux et al., 1998</xref>), tomato (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>), Bermuda grass, <italic>Cynodon</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), wild emmer wheat (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ergen et al., 2009</xref>), and barley (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant hormone produced in response to drought and dehydration. It has long been known that ABA targets stomatal closure as an important rapid response to minimize water loss (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2016</xref>). It was shown in various plant species that ABA is synthesized initially in leaf tissue and then in roots (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Seo and Koshiba, 2011</xref>), and the gene expression responses of rapidly dehydrated plants or detached leaves are different from those in leaves of intact plants grown under slowly developing drought (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ergen and Budak, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ergen et al., 2009</xref>). During the rapid dehydration of whole plants or detached leaves, in the absence of outside signaling systems, stomatal closure is completely controlled by ABA produced in the leaves and genes responding to dehydration within the leaf signaling system (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>). These are rapid and short-term responses over a few minutes or hours of dehydration. In contrast, during a slower developing drought, where not only leaves but roots and other parts of the plant are involved, stomatal closure is affected by initial rapid ABA production in leaves, followed by the later slower release of ABA as a signal produced from drought-affected roots (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Vertedor and Dodd, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Vishwakarma et al., 2017</xref>). Whole plants pulled from hydroponics and placed on paper towels go through rapid dehydration that usually results in rapid ABA signaling, which was earlier described as a short-term dehydration treatment over several hours (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ergen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>). Exogenous application of ABA to intact plants and detached leaves can be used to confirm the proposed role of ABA as a signaling agent of drought and dehydration (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in the regulation of plant responses to drought and dehydration. Drought Responsive Element Binding (<italic>DREB</italic>) genes have been reported as regulatory components of abiotic stress responses and, particularly, drought response (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal and Jha, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kuromori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Rehman and Mahmood, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Sah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, we identified that expression levels of the <italic>TaDREB5</italic> gene, which belongs to the <italic>DREB2</italic>-type TFs, correlate with yields of wheat varieties grown in the dry conditions of Kazakhstan (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>). Application of the Amplifluor-like SNP marker KATU-48, developed in our laboratory, showed a genetic polymorphism associated with two groups of Kazakh wheat genotypes. A significant down-regulation of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> transcript production was observed in dehydrated detached leaves of low-yield wheat varieties compared to non-stressed controls (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>). However, evaluation of the <italic>TaDREB5</italic> expression levels in leaves of the intact, soil-grown, drought-affected plants of the same wheat genotypes was not assessed.</p><p>Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y), also known as CCAAT Binding Factor (CBF) or Heme Activator Protein (HAP), is a complex TF, which is found in all eukaryotic organisms (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Swain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zanetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plant species, NF-Y TFs play diverse roles in plant development and stress responses, including: flowering time regulation, gametogenesis, embryogenesis, seed development, primary root elongation, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypocotyl elongation, plant performance, ABA signaling, and drought tolerance (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gusmaroli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Petroni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kuromori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Sah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Swain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zanetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). The majority of NF-Y genes are highly expressed under drought or dehydration (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), but some were reported to be down-regulated in response to restricted water availability, such as: <italic>OsNF-YA9</italic> during rapid dehydration of rice plants (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>SiNF-YA5</italic>, <italic>-A7</italic> and <italic>-B2</italic> in simulated drought with polyethylene glycol in foxtail millet plants (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>StNF-YC4</italic> in potato plants subjected to slow drought (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">van Muijen et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>PmNF-YA3</italic>, <italic>-A4</italic> and <italic>-C3</italic> in leaves of Chinese plum with mannitol simulated dehydration (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The NF-Y TFs consist of three different subunits: NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. The presence of all three subunits is essential for binding to the DNA <italic>cis</italic>-element named the CCAAT box (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Nardini et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast and mammals, each subunit of NF-Y is encoded by a single gene, which may have multiple splicing forms, (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani, 1999</xref>), whereas in plants, each NF-Y subunit is encoded by multiple genes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Siefers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Petroni et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The overexpression of the <italic>NF-YC9</italic> gene confers ABA hypersensitivity, resulting in rapid stomatal closure after exposure of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings to ABA treatment (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bi C.et al., 2017</xref>) due to physical interactions between NF-YC9 and the ABA-responsive bZIP transcription factor ABA-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5). In rice, several NF-YC subunits were reported to be involved in stress tolerance and plant performance under stress. For instance, overexpression of a rice gene encoding the NF-YC subunit designated Heme Activator Protein gene (<italic>OsHAP2E</italic>) confers resistance to pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought, and increases photosynthetic rate and tiller number (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of 70 Ac/Ds rice mutants for salinity tolerance identified one activation-tagged salt tolerant DS plant (DS-16, T3 generation), which showed enhanced expression of a gene encoding the NF-YC subunit, named <italic>OsNF-YC13</italic>. The authors identified it as a possible salt stress tolerance gene (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Manimaran et al., 2017</xref>). In transgenic rice plants, overexpression of a <italic>NF-YC</italic> gene from Bermuda grass, <italic>CdtNF-YC1</italic>, conferred tolerance to drought and salinity (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). However, in potato, the expression of the <italic>StNF-YB4</italic> gene was significantly down-regulated after 4 and 9 days of severe drought stress (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">van Muijen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In our previous study, <italic>TaNF-YC15</italic> was identified as the interacting partner of <italic>TaNF-YB2</italic> and <italic>TaNF-YB4</italic> subunits, which play a role in wheat productivity, including grain yield under drought (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2015</xref>). The expression of this gene was studied in bread wheat in response to both slowly developing drought and rapid dehydration of detached leaves. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>TaNF-YC15</italic> under these two stresses was different: under drought, levels of <italic>TaNF-YC15</italic> were initially increased and then slowly decreased, while leaf dehydration led to about 3-fold decrease in gene expression (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed: (1) to use an Amplifluor-like SNP marker to reveal an association between the <italic>NF-Y</italic> gene and the yield-under-drought trait; (2) to compare expression profiles of the identified <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> gene with the previously reported <italic>TaDREB5</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>) in leaves of wheat grown under drought and subjected to rapid dehydration; and (3) to examine stomatal conductance and changes in <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> and <italic>TaDREB5</italic> expression following ABA treatment of wheat plants grown in hydroponics. We found that <italic>TaDREB5</italic> expression correlates with grain yield under both drought and dehydration, while correlation of the <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression with grain yield is dependent on the type of stress. The identified correlations can be potentially used as markers for the selection of cultivars with high yield under drought in the process of conventional breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Plant Growth</title><p>Twelve local wheat varieties representing two groups with contrasting yields were selected from local varieties tested in the field trials, based on their grain yields under the dry weather conditions of Central and Northern Kazakhstan (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>). Seeds were obtained from the Karaganda Research Institute of Plant Industry and Breeding (Karaganda, Kazakhstan) and pre-germinated in Petri dishes. Twenty-four uniform seedlings of each variety were transplanted into plastic containers (60 &#x000d7; 25 &#x000d7; 25 cm), filled with equal volumes of commercial soil potting mix (Nesterovskoe, Astana, Kazakhstan) and clay soil from a nearby research field, with two containers per variety.

Three 1-month old plants of each variety (three biological replicates) were randomly selected from each container, before drought treatment (designated as Day 0), and the youngest fully developed leaves were collected individually into 10-ml plastic tubes. Leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction. Subsequently, watering was withheld in one of containers for 12 days, while watering was continued in the second container. Volumetric water content (VWC) in the soil was measured using a portable moisture meter (Model CS616, Campbell Scientific, Australia). When VWC value was decreased in the drought treatment approximately two-fold, from 40% field soil capacity to 20% (mild drought), the first symptoms of leaf wilting were observed. At this point, replicate leaves were collected from three independent plants from both drought-treated and well-watered containers and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2.

In the first case, there is a coordinated systemic response involving the entire plant at physiological and molecular levels in response to gradually decreasing water availability and increasing stress. In the second case, in rapidly dehydrated plants or leaves, the response can be attributed mainly to rapid protective changes within the leaves rather than the whole plant. This involves rapid signaling from other plant organs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Waadt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>). For wild emmer wheat and barley, global transcriptome and gene expression analyses have been compared after growth either in greenhouse conditions under slowly developing drought, or subjected to rapid shock-like dehydration of whole plants. It was found that several TFs showed different expression profiles under the two types of stresses in genotypes tolerant or sensitive to drought (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Ergen and Budak, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ergen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000fc;rel et al., 2016</xref>). The present study centered on two genes, <italic>TaDREB5</italic> and <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic>, to examine whether they may be differentially expressed. Associations between these two genes and the yield-under-drought trait were found using Amplifluor-like SNP markers (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>). These genes were selected due to the regulatory nature of TFs, which makes them more attractive candidates compared to other genes since they are potentially capable of regulating whole groups of downstream genes responsible for the same trait.</p><p>Our earlier work showed differences in expression patterns of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> in wheat varieties from Kazakhstan (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>) where expression was strongly decreased in all six low-yielding varieties, while it was unchanged or slightly increased in six high-yielding wheat varieties. There were also differences in response to slowly developing drought or rapid dehydration of detached leaves of bread wheat. The present study confirmed these results in the same sets of wheat varieties, including rapid dehydration of hydroponically grown intact plants (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,C</xref></bold>). A more rapid response of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> to dehydration in detached leaves (1.5 h) compared to whole plants (6 h) was evident, probably due to the faster dehydration of detached leaves.</p><p>Both high- and low-yielding groups of wheat genotypes showed statistically significant differences in <italic>TaDREB5</italic> gene expression in all three experiments compared to controls (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,C</xref></bold>). However, no substantial differences were found between slowly drought-affected and rapidly dehydrated plants within each of the two groups of wheat varieties. We can speculate that any signaling system activated by drought or dehydration in whole plants affects transcription of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> very similarly regardless of the slow or rapid application of stress. Dehydrin genes could be amongst the downstream genes targeted by TFs, like <italic>TaDREB5</italic>, during drought and dehydration. Immunoblot analysis of dehydrin polypeptides showed similar activity levels both in whole drought-stressed plants and in dehydrated detached leaves of Bermuda grass, <italic>Cynodon</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), similar to the expression pattern of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> pattern in our experiment. Expression profiles of other <italic>DREB</italic> genes in wheat were reported in a number of papers, e.g., for <italic>TaDREB1</italic> in the Chinese wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 54 (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2003</xref>) and for <italic>TaDREB2</italic> and <italic>TaDREB3</italic> in the Australian drought tolerant wheat variety RAC875 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Morran et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>DREB</italic> gene expression levels in wheat and other tested plants are usually low or very low. They increase several fold when plants are exposed to dehydration and drought (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>ABA is a well-documented mediator of signaling in drought-stressed or rapidly dehydrated plants, where the expression of ABA-dependent genes can be affected (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal and Jha, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2016</xref>). Comparison of ABA-dependent and ABA-independent gene responses in plants can therefore provide useful information about the regulation of stress-related genes, including regulatory genes. This study complements those reported earlier on the ABA-biosynthetic genes, zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and 9-<italic>cis</italic>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). These genes are differentially expressed in response to slowly developing drought in plants and rapidly dehydrated leaves of tomato (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> gene identified with SNP marker in this work is one of the <italic>TaNF-YC7</italic> homeologues located in the A genome of bread wheat. A phylogenetic tree of NF-YC proteins containing TaNFYC-A7 under the name TaNF-YC7 can be found in Figure 2B in <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al. (2015)</xref>. It is obvious that TaNFYC-A7 belongs to the same clade as TaNF-YC15 described in this paper. TaNF-YC15 was found in the Y2H screen with ZmNF-YB2a, which was previously reported to be responsible for increased yield under drought in transgenic maize (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). TaNF-YC15 was also isolated in another Y2H screen using the TaNF-YB4 subunit as bait. Constitutive TaNF-YB4 overexpression in wheat led to a significant increase in grain yield under well-watered conditions (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2015</xref>). These findings lead us to speculate that TaNFYC-A7, as a close homologue of TaNF-YC15, may play a role in the regulation of plant productivity.</p><p>Both high and low yielding wheat groups showed variable expression of <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> in both drought-stressed and rapidly dehydrated plants.

In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it has been shown that genes <italic>NF-YC3</italic>, <italic>-C4</italic> and <italic>-C9</italic> act together in a single hub regulated by ABA signaling (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Warpeha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kumimoto et al., 2013</xref>). We decided to test our hypothesis that the differences in response between slowly developing drought and rapid dehydration in wheat may be determined by the ABA signaling cascade. Due to technical feasibility, ABA-dependent expression of <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> and <italic>TaDREB5</italic> were compared using a hydroponic system. For both genes, expression was strongly evident after only 30 min of ABA application, while a second, later peak for <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression suggested that only this gene is strongly regulated by ABA (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E,F</xref></bold>). Previously, single peaks have been reported as significantly increased for various NF-Y TFs (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bi C.et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Na et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Only a few examples, such as <italic>PmNF-YB6</italic> and <italic>PmNF-YC5</italic>, show significant double-peak up-regulation, measured in young leaves of Chinese plum after 3, 6, and 24 h of ABA treatment (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, our results reveal an unusual pattern of <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression with two peaks of up-regulation in wheat.</p><p>Stomatal closure, a classic initial response in plants evolved to minimize water loss under drought and dehydration, is strongly regulated by the ABA signaling system (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Seo and Koshiba, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2016</xref>). Measurement of stomatal conductance, SC, can indicate how fast plants can react to the stress, and there are several reports concerning the regulation of SC and stomatal closure by TFs. Overexpression of <italic>TaNF-YB3;1</italic> in tobacco and <italic>StNF-YB3.1</italic> in potato were reported to cause stomatal closure, enhancing the expression of several ABA-related genes (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Xuanyuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), while overexpression of <italic>StNF-YA7</italic>, encoding a different subunit (NFY-A), reduced water loss and improved tolerance to slow drought in transgenic potato compared to controls (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Na et al., 2017</xref>). When intact non-stressed plants were treated with ABA in the present studies, they reacted sooner, due to the presence of an intact root system, with SC declining within 5&#x02013;10 min while detached leaves required 5&#x02013;15 min (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref></bold>). Compared to the high-yielding varieties, SC dropped significantly earlier for some of the low-yielding wheat varieties by about 5 min in two whole plant genotypes and in detached leaves of one genotype, respectively (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref></bold>). We can see from these experiments that stomatal closure is strongly regulated by ABA, similar to earlier reports (Reviewed by <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Seo and Koshiba, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2016</xref>). For example, the content of endogenous ABA was significantly increased in leaves of drought stressed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009</xref>) and maize (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goodger and Schachtman, 2010</xref>) plants, and this was accompanied by stomatal closure. In addition, it was reported that the increase in endogenous ABA after water withholding or application of exogenous ABA had the same effect on stomatal closure in <italic>Pelargonium</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Dehydration of whole plants or detached leaves showed similar results, with rapid closure of stomata after approximately 10 or 5 min, respectively, from the start of ABA application (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref></bold>). However, it was found that high-yielding wheat genotypes showed a significant delay of about 5 min in decrease of SC compared to the low-yielding varieties. These results are in accordance with those described above for potato, with overexpression of <italic>StNF-YB3.1</italic> causing stomatal closure which also was associated with a significant reduction in tuber yield (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Xuanyuan et al., 2017</xref>). In bread wheat in water-limited conditions, significant positive correlations between stomatal characteristics (width, length and area) and grain yield were reported (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Arminian et al., 2008</xref>). Our results suggest that wheat plants which close their stomata more slowly are associated with better yield performance in the field. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that wheat cultivar Drysdale showed higher ABA accumulation in leaves and quicker stomatal closure compared to the superior drought-tolerant breeding line IGW-3262 when water was withheld (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Saradadevi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It appears that plants can coordinate TF gene expression and ABA production to regulate down-stream genes affecting stomatal closure; in turn, this influences tolerance to drought and rapid dehydration, as well as final biomass and seed production (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Flexas and Medrano, 2002</xref>). In addition, it is important that water loss from wheat leaves depends not only on the size, density and behavior of stomata, but can be also regulated by the thickness and/or molecular content of the leaf cuticle (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000e4;ger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bi H. et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2018</xref>). The water loss of wheat varieties examined in this work was found to correlate well with grain yield under drought (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shavrukov et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A clear correlation exists between the expression levels of two TFs, <italic>TaDREB5</italic> and <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic>, in leaves of plants exposed to slowly developing drought or rapid dehydration of either intact plants or detached leaves, and grain yields of wheat varieties grown in the field under water limiting conditions (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Expression levels of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> were significantly increased in high-yielding varieties compared to controls regardless of which kind of stress was applied. In contrast, <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression profiles were more complex. Under slowly developing drought, high- and low-yielding wheat genotypes showed decreased and increased <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression, respectively. Interestingly, under rapid dehydration of detached leaves, the opposite trend was observed: an increase in <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression levels in nearly all high-yielding varieties tested, but a reduction in all low-yielding genotypes. These findings need to be further elaborated in future studies using a wider range of wheat varieties with contrasting yield-under-drought characteristics. If confirmed, changes in the expression of <italic>TaDREB5</italic> and the ratio of <italic>TaNFYC-A7</italic> expression under drought and dehydration treatments could potentially become useful molecular markers in breeding for the prediction and selection of high-yield genotypes for yield-under-dry conditions. Generation of expression data was just the first step in the analysis of gene function; further characterisation of the candidate genes described in this paper, and other genes identified in our project related to yield-under-drought, is ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LZ conducted the genotyping Amplifluor-like SNP analysis, AK and SJ supervised the experiments and interpreted the results.
