Much of this contact relied on high-elevation mountain valleys, often linking towns and caravanserais through alpine territories. This cultural exchange is thought to have reached a peak in the late first millennium A.D., and these exchange networks fostered the spread of domesticated plants and animals across Eurasia. However, few systematic studies have investigated the cultivated plants that spread along the trans-Eurasian exchange during this time. New archaeobotanical data from the archaeological site of Tashbulak (800&#x02013;1100 A.D.) in the mountains of Uzbekistan is shedding some light on what crops were being grown and consumed in Central Asia during the medieval period. The archaeobotanical assemblage contains grains and legumes, as well as a wide variety of fruits and nuts, which were likely cultivated at lower elevations and transported to the site. In addition, a number of arboreal fruits may have been collected from the wild or represent cultivated version of species that once grew in the wild shrubby forests of the foothills of southern Central Asia in prehistory. This study examines the spread of crops, notably arboreal crops, across Eurasia and ties together several data sets in order to add to discussions of what plant cultivation looked like in the central region of the Silk Road.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007464</institution-id><institution>Fondation Max van Berchem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frachetti</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006363</institution-id><institution>National Geographic Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frachetti</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Archaeological excavations and sampling at Tashbulak were funded by grants from ICARES (Washington University in St. Louis), National Geographic, and the Max van Berchem Foundation (PI: M.

Scholars are increasingly exploring the broader process of exchange through Central Asia, including the study of corridors of diffusion from the third millennium B.C. onward and systematic exchange systems of the late first millennium B.C. onward, collectively constituting a wide range of goods and peoples [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This cultural arena of interconnectivity tied certain Central Asian populations into a shared realm of commodity transfer, resulting in the spread of material goods over vast distances. Approaching the concept of the Silk Road, it is harder to pin the term down to one time period or cultural phase, especially seeing that scholars have been studying pre-Silk Road exchange in the archaeological record for decades [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, many of the most important routes of Eurasian exchange transected some of the highest mountain ranges in the world [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, limited archaeological investigation has been undertaken outside the major urban centers at lower elevations [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, there is still little scientific inquiry into what goods were actually moving along the historical trade routes [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We use archaeobotanical data to study what crops were actually consumed at these medieval towns and compare the data to other sites in order to explore the spread of domesticated plants across the ancient world. We suggest that orchards and vineyards around the oasis cities of Central Asia, such as Bukhara, Khiva, Loulan, and Samarkand, provided cultivated goods for merchants and travelers, who in turn carried those fruits and grains along a nodal network and ultimately across two continents. In this article, we synthesize medieval-period botanical data and present a systematic study of botanical remains recovered from anthropogenic sediments from Tashbulak, Uzbekistan (A.D. 800&#x02013;1100). We also suggest that most of the fruit crops identified in this archaeobotanical assemblage were carried to the site by merchants from lower elevations, based on the fact that many of these trees cannot grow at high elevations. By pulling together these diverse data sets and contrasting them with historical sources, we argue that arboreal crops were a prominent part of the economy across Central Asia during this period and that certain crops dispersed across Eurasia through Central Asia.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Historical sources</title><p>The archaeobotanical data that we present in this paper fit into an historical context; in order to interpret these data, we must understand what the historical sources tell us regarding the cultivation of crops in medieval Central Asia. Early literary accounts from Central Asia attest to the fruits of medieval urban markets and the commerce routes that spread them. For example, Abu Hamid al-Andalusi al-Gharnati traveled in Khorezm from 1130&#x02013;1155 and described cities, villages, farmsteads, and fortresses. He also stated that there were &#x0201c;fruits, the like of which I have not seen in any of the other countries I have visited&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]:88); specifically describing melons, dates, red and white grapes, apples, pears, pomegranates, and watermelons. About a century earlier, in 988, Ibn Hawqal described Khorezm as a &#x0201c;fertile country, producing many kinds of grain and fruit&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]:177). Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur, wrote that &#x0201c;[g]rapes, melons, apples, and pomegranates, all fruits, indeed, are good in Samarkand; two are famous, its apple and its &#x0015f;&#x00101;hib&#x0012b; (grape)&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]:77). Nuruddin Muhammad Jahangir (1569&#x02013;1627) repeatedly stated that farmers near Samarkand grew exceptionally sweet apricots, peaches, melons, and apples, as well as rice, millet, and wheat. He specifically noted that &#x0201c;[o]n one tray they brought many kinds of fruit&#x02014;K&#x00101;r&#x0012b;z melons, melons from Badakhshan and Kabul, grapes from Samarkand and Badakhshan, apples from Samarkand, Kashmir, Kabul, and from Jalalabad, which is a dependency of Kabul, and pineapples, a fruit that comes from the European ports&#x0201d; ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: Vol. 1:73). Al-Jahiz supposedly wrote a preserved late first millennium pamphlet on trade, which focuses on luxury goods coming into the Abbasid capital of Baghdad [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. He extensively discusses fresh and dried fruits as one of the most prominent trade goods. A cache of Sogdian documents recovered from the Mugh (ca. 600&#x02013;800 A.D.) citadel discuss economic transactions, notably the trade of large amounts of barley grains and wine [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Contemporaneous documents from the region also note the importance of the exchange of dried fruits and even suggest that some people paid their taxes in dried fruits and nuts [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The archaeobotanical data collaborate these historical texts by illustrating that people were moving fruits and nuts and that a diversity of cultivated foods was used in the cuisines of medieval Inner Asia.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Comparative archaeobotanical data</title><p>Archaeological studies complement the historical sources by illustrating how diverse economic strategies across Eurasia were at this time, surveys have identified the presence of cities, towns, and small farmsteads [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Stable isotope analyses of bone collagen demonstrated highly diverse diets between regions that were narrowly circumscribed within communities across this varied cultural landscape [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Examining previous studies of botanical remains from medieval contexts helps us understand how our new data fits into a broader Eurasian dispersal of domesticated trees. These findings are, in most cases, unpublished or hard to access outside Central Asia. While direct dates, photos, and descriptions of the identification criteria are lacking for most of these reports, they merit further consideration. In eastern Kazakhstan, a small archaeobotanical assemblage was collected at the fortified town of Talgar (ca. 700&#x02013;1200 A.D.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201409.g001">Fig 1</xref>); it contained remains of barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), both naked and hulled forms, broomcorn millet (<italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic>), and compact wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) grains, as well as wild seeds, notably <italic>Polygonum</italic> and <italic>Onopordum acanthium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another small study at the same site was conducted by Miller [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; the 2.4L of sediment contained free-threshing wheat and barley grains, a possible oat (<italic>Avena</italic> sp.) grain, and numerous wild seeds and dung fragments. Two additional small samples from the following season (1.0 and 1.5L of sediment) also contained wheat, barley, a possible foxtail millet grain (<italic>Setaria</italic> sp.), and wild seeds&#x02013;<italic>Chenopodium</italic>, <italic>Convulvolus</italic>, <italic>Cyperaceae</italic>, <italic>Trifolium</italic>, <italic>Trigonella</italic>, <italic>Hypericum</italic>, <italic>Plantago</italic>, and <italic>Galium</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also in eastern Kazakhstan, three flotation samples (24L of sediment total) from the medieval occupation (1220&#x02013;1420) at Begash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201409.g001">Fig 1</xref>; [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) were analyzed, containing 45 broomcorn and 11 foxtail millet grains, as well as 1,217 identified wild seeds or seed fragments representing 21 distinct categories of seeds. At Antonovka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201409.g001">Fig 1</xref>), 22 flotation samples and 382 liters of sediment from thirteenth century layers were floated [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Of the grains, 119 were of a highly compact form of wheat, the remainder came from hulled barley and broomcorn millet, and among the legumes, 69 were peas (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>), the rest were lentils (<italic>Lens culinaris</italic>).</p><fig id="pone.0201409.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0201409.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>A map of Central Asia showing the location of medieval archaeological sites that have reports of preserved archaeobotanical material (carbonized and/or desiccated).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0201409.g001"/></fig><p>Archaeobotanical studies in the Talas Valley of southern Kazakhstan were conducted on sediments from a fortified structure that was excavated at Akyrtas (ca. 900&#x02013;1200 A.D.) and a mosque at Ornek (Karluk; ca. 900&#x02013;1200 A.D.), both of which contained domesticated grains of wheat, naked and hulled barley, and broomcorn millet, unspecified legumes, as well as wild seeds of <italic>Chenopodium</italic>, <italic>Lithospermum arvense</italic>, and <italic>Polygonum</italic>. Grape pips (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>; n = 3) and apple/pear seeds (n = 7) were also recovered from Ornek ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]:99).

The most interesting discovery from the seventh century occupation layers was a single rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) grain. He also recovered a single rice grain from sediments from Karaspan-tobe (ca. 300&#x02013;500 A.D.), as well as a purported plum pit (<italic>Prunus</italic> sp.), grape pips, peas, and millet, barley, and wheat grains.</p><p>At several sites in Ferghana, a Soviet excavation team dissolved unfired mudbrick in water and hand collected large carbonized seeds from within [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The mudbricks came from fifth to seventh century layers in the Osh Region at the border of Kyrgyzstan. Barley, both hulled and naked forms, was the most prominent grain from Kuyuk Tepe and Tudai Kalon. Compact and lax-eared forms of wheat were recovered from the sites of Kuyuk Tepe, Munchak Tepe (compact), and Tudai Kalon. Broomcorn millet grains were also recovered from all three of these sites and seeds from a small-seeded form of lentils were recovered from Kuyuk Tepe and Munchak Tepe. Peas and an unspecified vetch (<italic>Vicia</italic> sp.) were reported from Kuyuk Tepe. Rice grains were also reported from Munchak Tepe, on the Sokh alluvial fan near the Syr Darya River, as were grape pips, peach and apricot stones, and melon and unspecified cucurbit seeds ([<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]:176). <italic>Papaver</italic> sp., although likely wild, and cotton seeds (<italic>Gossypium</italic> sp.) were recovered from Tudai Kalon and Kuyuk Tepe, as well as a slightly latter (ca. 600-800A.D.) site in the same region, called Ak Tepe [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An abundance of capper seeds (<italic>Capparis spinosa</italic>) was recovered from a burial at Damkul Cemetery, also near Kerkidon [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Grapes represent the most prevalent fruit found at Kerkidon, and at the nearby site of Settlement 5a a possible winery was excavated. Wineries have been reported from medieval sites across southern Central Asia [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Gorbunova [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] also references a study from the 1970s, where a series of occupation sites and burial grounds in the Asht Region of northern Tajikistan were excavated, hand-picked seeds at those sites supposedly included melons (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic>), watermelons, unspecified nuts, peaches (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>), apricots (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>armeniaca</italic>), cherries (<italic>Prunus</italic> sp.), apples (<italic>Malus pumila</italic> or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sieversii</italic>), and almonds (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>dulcis</italic>). An even more interesting series of botanical discoveries came from the 1933 excavations at the fortified citadel at Mugh (ca. 600&#x02013;800 A.D.) in northern Tajikistan, which is usually associated with Sogdians. Among the handpicked remains of cultivated plants, the excavators noted cherry, peach, apricot, grape, apple, and cotton seeds, grains of hulled barley, free-threshing wheat, broomcorn millet, a large amount of walnut (<italic>Juglans regia</italic>) and almond shells, and legumes that they claim are fava beans (<italic>Vicia faba</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They also claimed to have grains of cultivated <italic>Echinochloa crus galli</italic>, a weed or loosely domesticated grain that is sometimes allowed to grow or is planted in fields in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Yakubov [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also referred to finds of plum, cherry, peach, and apricot pits, as well as apple and grape seeds from contemporaneous sites in the region around Mugh. Furthermore, Lunina [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] noted the remains of fruits in a well at the southern Sogdian city of Nesef, dating between the eighth and twelfth centuries; these finds include apple, watermelon, cucurbits, and grape seeds, peach and apricot pits, and walnut and almond shells.</p><p>One of the largest archaeobotanical study conducted in Central Asia consists of hand-collected plant remains from Bazar-Dara (cliff-market; nearly 4,000masl), Tajikistan [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The ancient high-elevation town would have been supplied by caravans from lower elevation farming centers and is roughly contemporaneous with Tashbulak. Bubnova [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] theorized that there would have been steady supply routes carrying fruits, nuts, legumes, and grains to the mining communities at these higher elevations [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There are also high-elevation remains of ancient water mills for grain grinding in the Aksu River valley. Among the wide variety of cultivated fruits and grains recovered at the site, the excavators identified wheat and barley as well as one possible rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic>) grain [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, they also report to have found rice, as well as <italic>Vicia</italic>, peas, and lentils. The range of fruits that Bubnova [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] identified from the site is unparalleled at any other archaeological site in Eurasia, while there are no direct dates on the material, and neither photographs nor morphological descriptions were made, she claimed that the project botanists identified melon (13,112 seeds) and watermelon seeds (n = 246), mulberry seeds (<italic>Morus</italic> sp.), walnut shells (7,474), other nut shells, apricot and peach pits, almond shells (n = 10,315), apple (n = 975) and pear (n = 10,782) seeds, cherry pits, as well as pits of what she called cherry plums (with over 9,000 pits), pistachio (<italic>Pistacia vera</italic>) shells, grape pips (supposedly recovering 52,805 from house 2 at the site and over 5,000 from the other contexts), and barberry seeds (<italic>Berberis</italic> sp.). She also claims to have found a few fruits and nuts that have never been identified in archaeological sites in Central Asia before, but the finds are not impossible to believe given the extent of the trans-Eurasian exchange during this time period, including date pits (<italic>Phoenix d</italic>actylifera), hazelnut shells (<italic>Corylus</italic> cf. <italic>avellana</italic>), persimmon seeds (<italic>Diospyros</italic> sp.), and most astonishing of all, one coconut shell (<italic>Cocos nucifera</italic>) and some form of unspecified cucurbit seed, possibly <italic>Lagenaria siceraria</italic>. It is important to note that there were later occupations at the site and some of these finds could have been recovered out of context.</p><p>Merv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201409.g001">Fig 1</xref>) was briefly, during the twelfth century A.D., one of the largest cities in the world and arguably the most strategic &#x02018;fueling station&#x02019; along the Silk Road. In 1992 and 1993, M. Nesbitt conducted extensive analysis on 1,074 liters of sediment from early medieval layers, comprising 100 samples and 62 discrete deposits. They published a synthesis of the major finds in Herrmann and Kurbansakhatov [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Of the 62 contexts that were sampled, 37 contained domesticated plant remains&#x02013;ubiquities (number of contexts in which the given plant category appears) were provided for the 11 cultivated species recovered. The most ubiquitous was cotton, appearing in 78% of the contexts, followed by hulled barley (46%) and free-threshing bread wheat (38%); broomcorn millet was only represented in 3% of the contexts. Legumes were represented by lentils (24%) and peas (8%). Fruit and nut remains from the site included, grapes (8%), hackberries (<italic>Celtis</italic> sp.; 8%), melons (3%), peaches (3%), and almonds (3%) [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moving further west, Brite et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] brought together a list of Soviet-period (mostly 1960-1970s) mentions of domesticated crops in archaeological reports. They noted the presence of grapes, millet, and barley as far back as the fifth century B.C., and peaches, Russian olives (<italic>Elaeagnus angustifolia</italic>), and melons possibly appearing sometime between the fourth century B.C. and the fourth century A.D. They also noted grass peas (<italic>Lathyrus sativa</italic>), possible oats (<italic>Avena sativa</italic>), and possible alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) by the fourth to fifth centuries A.D. They provided references from an archaeological report from 1966 claiming sorghum (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>) by the sixth to eight centuries A.D. and rice by the seventh to eighth centuries A.D. Collectively, these data illustrate that cultivation was a prominent part of the medieval Central Asia economy; they also show that fruit orchards were maintained across a large geographic area and crop varieties were dispersed across Eurasia during this period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Excavations at the archaeological site of Tashbulak were conducted as part of the ARQ (Archaeological Research of the Qarakhanids) project, in collaboration with the Institute of Archaeology in Samarkand, a branch of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan. Appropriate excavation permits were obtained through the institute and the project was codirected by Michael Frachetti and Farhod Maksudov. Tashbulak is a medieval town located at roughly 2,200 masl in the Malguzar range of eastern Uzbekistan. At such a high-elevation, the site is above the growing ecocline for many of the fruit trees that were identified at the site. Hence, this site would have been, at least in part, supplied by lower elevation farming communities through trade and supply routes, with grains and legumes cultivated locally. A 2x1 meter (roughly 2 meters deep) trench was cut into a midden deposit (identified through magnetometry) in the center of the town, next to what has been interpreted as the ancient market bazaar (South Unit in <xref rid="pone.0201409.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Flotation samples from this midden, in association with material from a nearby larger excavation unit (North Unit), have provided remains of carbonized and preserved fruits and grains. This archaeobotanical study consists of 22 sediment samples, comprising sediments from 13 contexts at the site. The volume of each sample varied greatly, from roughly 1 liter to as much as 37.5L (FS25). In total, 513 liters of soil were floated, 223L of which is reported in this paper. Spengler floated these samples in the field using a bucket method [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Light fraction was collected down to 0.355mm, although systematic sample sorting was only conducted down to 0.5mm. Heavy fractions were collected down to 2.0mm, after several attempts to sieve the sediments through a 1.0mm sieve failed, due to heavy gravel content in the colluvium. Heavy fractions were sorted in the field using a 5x hand lens. All carbonized organic material and cultural artifacts were collected. Cultural artifacts, including beads, glass, metal fragments (most notably a fragment of silver foil), sherds, and slag, were handed over to the project for cataloging with other excavated artifacts. The macrobotanical remains were identified using a comparative collection of Central Asian seeds and several identification keys. The identifiable seeds and fruit parts were quantified and recorded in the data table, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201409.s001">S1 Table</xref>. The archaeobotanical assemblage will be cataloged and stored in the archaeological archival collections at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, in association with the Archaeobotanical Laboratories, under the directorship of Robert Spengler.

The remaining 5,657 seeds and fruit parts come from small wild herbaceous plants or in a few cases, such as <italic>Potentilla</italic>, possibly short woody plants. An additional 107 Cerealia fragments were also identified, but not counted in the totals due to the inability to determine Minimum Number Individual (MNI) estimates on these fragments. The Cerealia category was used when a grain fragment was too damaged to differentiate between wheat and barley. In discussions of abundance and density, Cerealia fragments are considered separately, because several fragments could have come from one seed.

Two possible long narrow durum or macaroni wheat (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic>) grains and a few rachises from a tetraploid wheat were also recovered. Both wheat and barley were recovered at Tashbulak in association with their rachises, allowing us to categorize the wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201409.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

The fruits and nuts from Tashbulak represent the first study of the plants that were passing through these high-elevation routes. The data we present in this paper link the mountain routes of Eurasia, seeing that similar species have been identified at early archaeological sites as far south as Pakistan and as far north as Xinjiang. At archaeological sites in northern Pakistan and Kashmir after 2000 B.C., macrobotanical remains of almonds, apricots, grapes, hackberries (<italic>Celtis caucasica</italic>), and peaches have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Furthermore, tetraploid wheat has never been recovered from Central Asia before; although, Watson [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggested that they spread with the Islamic conquests across Eurasia. The dearth of archaeobotanical data for tetraploid wheats in Central Asia prevents us from approaching the topic of the crop&#x02019;s relationship with Islam. However, tetraploid wheats are an important crop in the southern Islamic world today. In addition to the typical macaroni wheats (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>durum</italic>), farmers in southern Central Asia and across the Iranian Plateau and Mesopotamia historically grew Khorezm wheat (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>turanicum</italic>), a variety typically attributed to the broader northern Iranian region, and Persian wheat (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>carthlicum</italic>), a lesser known morphotype grown across southwest Asia in the past. We did not quantify the number of hexaploid verses tetraploid wheat rachises, due to the damaged state of many of the specimen; however, there appear to only be a few tetraploid examples. The rachises and culm nodes also suggest that the crops were grown near the site and that the chaff was processed close to the site; this conclusion is further attested by the presence of barley chaff impressions on a few of the sherd fragments, showing that it was used as binder. Interestingly, neither of the East Asian millets (<italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic> and <italic>Setaria italica</italic>) were identified in the assemblage, despite the importance of these crops across Central Asia for millennia prior; nor is rice present, despite its importance in local cuisines today.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Grapes</title><p>Wine is closely associated with Sogdian merchants in historical texts, especially at the oasis cities that span the region of Xinjiang and northern Qinghai in western China. &#x02018;Uighur&#x02019; wine production techniques are still practiced in some of these towns, especially around Kashgar, and viticulture can be traced back in this region to the mid-first millennium B.C., as is evidenced by illustrations of grape vines on a textile from the Sampula Cemetery in Turfan, an actual 116-cm-long vine preserved in a tomb from the Yanghai Cemetery [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and pips from Tuzusai in eastern Kazakhstan [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

The archaeobotanical specimens may represent a gradual process of maintenance and eventual cultivation of wild species in the region or the hybridization of various populations of the same species, as demonstrated through population genetics studies of apples and walnuts [<xref rid="pone.0201409.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201409.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The dispersal of these crops along the Silk Road played a significant role in their domestication and eventual adoption by farmers across Europe and Asia. Several other fruits in the assemblage represent domesticated crops that originated thousands of kilometers away. Notably, apples were originally domesticated in the Tien Shan further north in Central Asia, grapes were domesticated in western southwest Asia or the eastern Mediterranean, and peaches and apricots appear to have been domesticated in the Yangtze River valley of eastern China.</p><p>The Tashbulak assemblage provides the first systematically collected and recorded data point for most of these crops in Central Asia. It is also important to acknowledge that many of these fruits were not cultivated at or around the site. Night frosts at these high elevations continue through the spring and would damage or destroy the flowers for most of these arboreal crops. While some of the grains are grown at high elevations today, fruit trees are restricted to mid- or low elevations in the foothills. Therefore, these fruits were transported to the site from lower elevations, either dried or fresh, when in season. Furthermore, historical and art historical sources emphasize how highly regarded certain fruit varieties were during the past millennium in Central Asia and how readily people spread them between population centers.</p><p>The comparative data we present in this paper illustrate the role that the trans-Eurasian exchange routes played in spreading cultivated crops across Eurasia. In contrasting our new data with the reports from other contemporaneous sites across Central Asia, we can discuss what role these crops played in the broader economy and when certain crops first appeared at these towns. This study is particularly important for understand the dispersal of arboreal crops, which have received limited attention from scholars in the past. Fruit orchards were cultivated around every medieval village or urban center across Central Asia, and fruits were carried to high-elevation towns. Ultimately, this trade in fruits and nuts lead to the dispersal of these crops across Europe and Asia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201409.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Full archaeobotanical data table for the Tashbulak project.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201409.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0201409.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>. <article-title>Silk Roads or steppe roads?
