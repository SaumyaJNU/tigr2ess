    "GP-1 is a novel glycoprotein produced by Streptomyces kanasenisi ZX01 that was isolated from soil near Kanas Lake with significant bioactivity against tobacco mosaic virus. However, extremely low fermentation production has largely hindered further research and market applications on glycoprotein GP-1. In this study, response surface methodology was used to optimize fermentation conditions in a shake flask for higher glycoprotein GP-1 production. When the optimized fermentation conditions were inoculum volume of 6%, initial pH of 6.5, and rotating speed of 150 rpm, glycoprotein GP-1 production could reach 0.9253 mg/L, which was increased by 52.14% compared to the original conditions. In addition, scale-up fermentation was conducted in a 5-L bioreactor to preliminarily explore the feasibility for mass production of glycoprotein GP-1 in a large fermentor, obtaining GP-1 production of 2.54 mg/L under the same conditions, which was 2.75 times higher than the production obtained from a shake flask of 0.9253 mg/L. This work will be helpful to improve GP-1 production on a large scale and lay the foundations for developing it as a novel agent against plant virus."
