documented, and may pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and pathologists. They
often mimic other cutaneous tumors or present as nonspecific neoplasms. Diagnosis of
a collision tumor may be an accidental and unexpected histological finding. Many
combinations of collision tumors have been described, with the most frequently
reported being the combination of nevus and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A
melanocytic tumor in collision with a benign or malignant epithelial neoplasm is
less commonly documented. Some collision tumors involve melanomas, most frequently
in combination with a BCC. <sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Even more exceptional is the
involvement of an adnexal tumor in a collision tumor. Syringomas are relatively
common benign tumors that originate in the sweat glands. They present clinically as
1 to 5 mm yellowish, rounded or flat-topped dermal papules. They are generally
multiple, and are distributed symmetrically on the chest, neck, or face, and,
especially, the lower eyelids.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We
report an unusual case of a collision tumor on the nose involving a melanoma
<italic>in situ</italic> and a syringoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of this combination.</p></sec><sec><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>An 82-year-old Caucasian man with a history of atopic dermatitis and osteoarthritis
presented with a brown-colored asymptomatic macular lesion on the left nasal root.
The lesion had grown progressively for approximately two years and was untreated.
Examination revealed an ill-defined 15 mm x 7 mm macule with an irregular shape and
asymmetrical distribution of the pigment network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The clinical impression was of lentigo maligna and a punch
biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>

</p><p>Microscopic study of the biopsy revealed lentiginous melanocytic dysplasia, which
involved the hair follicles and was positive for Melan-A, HMB45 and S-100 stains.
Subsequently, the lesion was completely excised by surgery. Histopathologically, the
surgical specimen revealed two distinct histological components. In the basal layer,
there were melanocytic dysplasia and nucleocytoplasmic abnormalities with an
irregular distribution and involving hair follicles. In the upper and middle dermis
there were clusters of small ducts, occasionally with comma-shaped extensions, lined
by a double-layered epithelium typical of a syringoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that melanoma was
positive for Melan-A and HMB45 and that syringoma was positive for the
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In recent years, various terms have been used to describe two lesions occurring in
one site, resulting in increasing terminological confusion. Satter <italic>et
al.</italic> proposed a classification to simplify the nomenclature of these
lesions, classifying them as collision, combined, colonized, or biphenotypic
tumors.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Collision tumors
are defined as two distinct neoplasms that occur within close proximity of each
other but maintain sharply distinct boundaries. Neoplasms consisting of two
phenotypically different, yet imperceptibly intertwined populations of malignant
cells are referred to as combined tumors, and immunohistochemical stains are often
required to appreciate the two tumor cell populations. Colonization describes a
situation where large dendritic melanocytes populate another neoplasm, e.g., a
melanoma <italic>in situ</italic> colonizing a BCC. Biphenotypic tumors are
exceptionally rare neoplasms that arise from a common stem cell precursor that
undergoes divergent differentiation.</p><p>In our patient, the syringoma was not clinically apparent and there were no
syringomas in other facial areas. Melanoma and syringoma were close but separated,
indicating a collision tumor; this impression was supported by the
immunohistochemical data, which clearly differed and did not overlap. Immunostaining
with CEA revealed an epithelial syringomatous population, while HMB45 positivity in
the melanocytic population confirmed the presence of a melanoma <italic>in
situ</italic>, thus drawing a clear boundary between the two tumors. This,
together with the fact that the initial biopsy only showed the melanocytic component
and not the syringoma, confirmed that this was a collision tumor.</p><p>Reactive eccrine gland ductal proliferation has been reported in a variety of
inflammatory skin diseases (e.g. scarring alopecia) and benign and malignant
neoplasms. Guitart <italic>et al.</italic> proposed the term of &#x02018;syringomatous
dermatitis&#x02019; for those cases of reactive hyperplastic response of the eccrine duct
resulting from an inflammatory skin reaction.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In our case we found sclerotic dermal changes in the area of
the syringoma, the ducts were located in the middle dermis and some presented with
typical comma-shaped structures. These findings, along with the absence of a
previous inflammatory cutaneous process, are distinguishable from reactive eccrine
gland ductal proliferation and confirm the diagnosis of a syringoma.</p><p>To date, a few cases of collision tumors involving a syringoma have been reported in
association with intradermal nevi, BCCs, epidermal cyst and Spitz nevus.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Whether the coexistence of a syringoma with these
conditions occurs by chance alone remains unclear, but it may be that the silent
form of this tumor occurs more frequently than suspected.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Syringomas are common lesions found on the face, and
therefore may occasionally be found in biopsies or excisions of facial lesions
performed for unrelated pathologies, just like solar lentigines, seborrheic
keratosis or actinic keratosis.</p><p>We report the first case of a collision tumor involving a syringoma and a melanoma
<italic>in situ</italic>. Syringomas are common, but their association with
other types of tumor is rare. Histopathology and immunohistochemical staining were
very helpful in distinguishing between the two components. Complete excision
biopsies are necessary to establish the diagnosis of collision tumors, and long-term
follow up is recommended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflict of Interests: None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>Study conducted at the Hospital Universitari Sagrat Cor de Barcelona - Barcelona,
