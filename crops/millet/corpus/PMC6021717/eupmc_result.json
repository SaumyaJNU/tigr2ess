    "Fermentation and sprouting have been shown to increase nutrient bioavailability and modify the functional properties of foods. Application of these methods in the preparation of infant foods and complementing cereals with legumes will address nutrient density and viscosity problems associated with infant foods. Infant foods were formulated from blends of treated bambara nut and pearl millet. Functional properties, pasting properties, and sensory acceptability of the blends were studied. Millet and bambara nut were soaked separately in water and allowed to ferment for 48 hr at room temperature. While for sprouting, millet and bambara nut were soaked for 12 and 24 hr, respectively, at room temperature, and soaked seeds were separately sprouted for 48 hr. After fermentation and sprouting, the seeds were oven-dried and then milled into a flour of 0.6 mm size. The flours were formulated to six (A, B, C, D, E, and F) complementary diets. The results show that sample E had the suitable water absorption capacity, while, for oil absorption capacity, various blends showed suitability except samples A and B. In terms of swelling capacity, sample F (6.52 ± 0.01%) was the suitable at 60°C. Treatment and blending significantly influenced trough, final viscosity, and pasting time. In sensory acceptability, sample B was adjudged the best. This study revealed that sample C was the best in respect to functional and pasting properties for infant food; however, sample B received the best general acceptability."
