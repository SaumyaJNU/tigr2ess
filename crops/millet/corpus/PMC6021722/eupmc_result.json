    "This study was carried out to optimize the compositions of red teff flour with malted soybean flour and papaya fruit powders for better nutritional quality and sensory acceptability of porridge. Total eleven formulations of the composite flours were determined using D-optimal mixture design with the help of Minitab Version 16 Statistical Software. The three ingredients were considered in the ranges of 55%-70%, 20%-30%, 5%-15% for red teff flour, malted soybean flour, and Papaya fruit powder, respectively. The prepared porridge samples from formulations were analyzed for nutritional composition, antinutritional factors, and sensory acceptability. Results of the study showed the significant difference (p < .05) in ash, fat, fiber, protein, carbohydrate, energy, iron, calcium, zinc, β-carotene, phytates, tannin, appearance, taste, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability as the composition of ingredients were changed. The overall optimum point was found in a range of red teff flour (60%-70%), malted soybean flour (20%-27.5%), and papaya fruit powder (10%-12.5%). In conclusion, the present approach can help in improve infants dietary quality of complementary foods by developing nutritionally enhanced red teff-based porridge used for intervention of malnutrition."
