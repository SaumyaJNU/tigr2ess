    "Rotator cuff repairs seek to achieve adequate tendon fixation and to secure the fixation during the process of biological healing. Currently, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has become the gold standard. One of the earliest defined techniques is single-row repair but the inadequacy of single-row repair to precisely restore the anatomical footprint as well as the significant rates of retear especially in large tears have led surgeons to seek other techniques. Double-row repair techniques, which have been developed in response to these concerns, have various modifications like the number and placement of anchors and suture configurations. When the literature is reviewed, it is possible to say that double-row repairs demonstrate superior biomechanical properties. In regard to retear rates, both double row and transosseous equivalent (TOE) techniques have also yielded more favorable outcomes compared to single-row repair. But the clinical results are conflicting and more studies have to be conducted. However, it is more probable that superior structural integrity will yield better structural and functional results in the long run. TOE repair technique is regarded as promising in terms of better biomechanics and healing since it provides better footprint contact. Knotless TOE structures are believed to reduce impingement on the medial side of tendons and thus aid in tendon nutrition; however, there are not enough studies about its effectiveness. It is important to optimize the costs without endangering the treatment of the patients. We believe that the arthroscopic TOE repair technique will yield superior results in regard to both repair integrity and functionality, especially with tears larger than 3â€‰cm. Although defining the pattern of the tear is one of the most important guiding steps when selecting the repair technique, the surgeon should not forget to evaluate every patient individually for tendon healing capacity and functional expectations."
