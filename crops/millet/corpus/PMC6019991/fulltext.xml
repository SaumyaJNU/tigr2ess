A total of 770 preconception women were enrolled belonging to 18 villages from five counties across the Belagavi district in Karnataka state. Women were identified through a household survey and selected by a cluster sampling method with the help of Nurse Midwives and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). Non-pregnant and non-lactating women with parity 0&#x02013;3 were included. Those with haemoglobin less than 8&#x000a0;g/dL and/or who were using permanent and temporary methods of birth control were excluded. The study was approved by J N Medical College, Belagavi Institutional Ethics Committee on Human Subjects Research. Informed written consent was obtained from each study participant.</p><p id="Par13">Socio-demographic, obstetric and food insecurity data were collected by trained Home Visit Research Assistants (HVRA) by interviewing women in their households. Information regarding per capita income (in Rupees/month) was collected and socio-economic status (SES) was classified using the Modified Prasad classification for the study period (2014). SES was classified as upper, upper middle, middle, lower middle and lower Class based on per capita monthly income of Rupees 5357 and above, 2652&#x02013;5356, 1570&#x02013;2651, 812&#x02013;1569 and 811 or less respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Information regarding parity, age of marriage and history of consanguinity (matrimony between closely related individuals) were collected as part of obstetric history. Food insecurity status was assessed based on a nine item questionnaire and categorized into four types: food secure, mildly food insecure, moderately food insecure and severe food insecure using Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) for measurement of food access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Hemoglobin (Sahli&#x02019;s Method) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was estimated by trained technicians using capillary blood in the health centres and anaemia was graded as per WHO criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The anthropometric measurements were carried out in primary health centres. Maternal height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), waist, and hip circumference measurements were obtained by a specially trained assessment team utilizing standardized calibrated study equipment. Subjects were lightly clothed with no footwear. Height was recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm and weight to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg by utilizing stadiometer and electronic weighing scales respectively. MUAC and, Waist and Hip Circumferences were recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm by Circumference insertion measuring tape and retractable tapes respectively. BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated from recorded height and weight. The WHO recommended appropriate Body Mass Index (BMI) for Asian populations and their cut-off values were used for classification. Women were classified as underweight, Normal, Overweight and Obese based on BMI of less than 18.5, 18.5 to 22.9, 23 to 24.9 and more than or equal to 25 respectively.

Almost all of the women were anemic, about one-third underweight, majority had inadequate intake of micro and macronutrients and one-fourth were food insecure.</p><p id="Par22">This was a community based study with participants identified through household survey of Married Women of Reproductive Age from a cross section of rural areas of Belagavi District of North Karnataka region of India. Food insecurity as well as socioeconomic and nutritional status were determined using validated assessment methods. Additionally, actual intake of macro and micronutrients was assessed by a 24-h dietary recall by a trained dietician. Though less accurate, Haemoglobin level of the participants was estimated by Sahli&#x02019;s method since the Primary Health Centres generally use this method and is recommended for community screening of anemia. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] Further, type of anemia was not evaluated in this study. Additionally, clustering was not accounted for in the analysis.</p><p id="Par23">Studies conducted in central and eastern India have reported the prevalence of mild to moderate anaemia in the range of 42.1 to 60.8% and 39.6 to 48.0% respectively. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] However, National Family Health Survey-2015-16 (NFHS-4) reported a lower prevalence of anaemia (41.2% for Belagavi district and 46.1% for Karnataka state). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] The lower prevalence may be due to methodological differences in the estimation of Hemoglobin. We found that anaemia was prevalent among all the women irrespective of their socio-economic strata, however, the severity of anaemia was greater among lower SES women. Anthropometric evaluation showed that most of the women had either a normal BMI or were underweight. A study done in a South Indian state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed that 31.3% of preconception women were undernourished and NFHS-4 reported a comparatively lower prevalence (20.6% for Belagavi District and 24.3% for Karnataka state) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another study in neighbouring Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that 25.6% of preconception women, especially adolescents were undernourished.</p><p id="Par24">Evaluation of the recommended daily allowance and the actual intake of various macro and micronutrients showed that the diet was rich in carbohydrates and fats. The food consumption pattern in this population showed that the caloric intake was relatively adequate in majority of the women. However, the total protein, fibre and essential micronutrient intake was low in the study participants. Earlier studies have reported poor nutritional status in women of reproductive age. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] In the present study, nearly half the participants were Lacto-vegetarians and the type of diet was not associated with prevalence of anaemia. Additionally, intake of important hematopoietic micronutrients such as Iron, Vitamin B6, Folate and Vitamin B12 was not associated with prevalence of anaemia in both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian population. Hence, it may be inferred that vegetarianism may not be a major contributing factor to cause anaemia.</p><p id="Par25">Food insecurity was not a major concern in the study group which was found only in 27.4% families compared to reported prevalence among urban and tribal communities of India. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Similar findings were observed in a study conducted in north India where 25% of the households were food insecure. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] A study conducted in the Western Highlands of Guatemala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] revealed that, 35.9% of women were food secure, 46.1% had moderate food insecurity and 18% women had severe food insecurity. Regardless of the reported food security status, more than three-fourth of women in both food secure and insecure groups were anaemic. It was observed that food security was not a protective factor to prevent women from being anaemic. This can be attributed to the dietary and cultural norms in the society wherein most of the population is vegetarian and where the diet is protein deficit. Another issue is that the society is male dominated where females eat the left over, less nutritious food. We can safely infer that food security does not ensure food quality. Higher food security among low socio-economic strata families compared to lower middle and upper classes can be attributed to various schemes of government like provision of food grains (Rice, Wheat and Finger Millet), sugar and palm oils free of cost or at a highly subsidized rate for low socioeconomic people in the society. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] Preconception care can make a useful contribution to reducing maternal and childhood morbidity and mortality and also improve maternal and child health in both high- and low-income countries. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] Results of this study are important as the nutritional status of the preconception women in this population is poor and might impact the health of both mother and child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par26">The nutritional status of preconception women is poor and food security is common in this population. Anaemia in women of reproductive age group can be a major public health hazard if not addressed strongly. The health of a woman in the reproductive age group has direct implications on the health of the new born babies she will bear in the future. Though emphasis is given for nutrition during pregnancy, there is an urgent need to create awareness and implement interventions to improve the nutritional status during the preconception period itself so as to improve the maternal health and in turn child health.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ASHA</term><def><p id="Par5">Accredited social health activist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par6">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HFIAS</term><def><p id="Par7">Household food insecurity access scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HVRA</term><def><p id="Par8">Home visit research assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MUAC</term><def><p id="Par9">Mid upper arm circumference</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Some of the data presented (Anthropometry and Food insecurity) here was collected as part of Women First: Preconception Maternal Nutrition Trial.
