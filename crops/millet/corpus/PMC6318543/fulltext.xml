The mean age was 37.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14.5, with a female/male ratio of 8/9. Thirteen (76.4%) patients had Stage IIb disease, and 2 (11,7%) patients had Stage III disease. In 2 (11,7%) patients have locally aggressive tumor that had Stage 3. Fifteen (88.2%) of the cases involved lower extremity, whilst 2 (11.8%) of them involved upper extremity. An arterial reconstruction was carried out in all patients. Wide tumor resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction were performed in 6 (35.2%) patients. Other 11 (65.8%) patients were treated with wide resection and soft tissue reconstruction. Postoperative data included; perioperative morbidities such as bleeding, infection, graft thrombosis, rupture, metastatic local recurrence and mortality. Ankle brachial index (ABI) and color-flow-duplex-scan (CFDS) were done at the final follow-up of the study, in order to prove the efficacy of reconstruction.

Three (17.6%) patients had local recurrence (1/3 patient died and 2/3 (11.7%) patients underwent transfemoral amputation). At the last follow-up, 9 (52.9%) patients were alive without evidence of disease, 8 (47.1%) patients were died due to primary disease. There were 8 (47.1%) patients alive with an intact limb.

The present data show that there is no difference concerning survival rates between major amputation and limb salvage.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Therefore, it seems that such an approach is justified in this group of patients. The present paper, which aims to evaluate the results of limb-sparing surgery, shows that functional outcome of the limb is satisfactory when limb salvage is achieved. In addition to that, our results show that the perioperative period is not complication-free and wound problems are major complications, which may lead to failure of revascularization and subsequently major amputation in the early postoperative period.</p><p id="p0100">In order to maintain a disease-free survival, it is essential to carry out an en-bloc resection accompanied with resection of the vascular bundle. The main indication for vascular resection was providing R0 resection. However, the risk of acute limb ischemia is considerably high after ligature of the main arterial trunk of the limb. Therefore, an arterial reconstruction is mandatory in limb salvage. Arterial reconstruction can be performed by end-to-end anastomosis but this is rarely the case because en-bloc resection usually necessitates the resection of a long segment of the artery. Hence, use of an autologous substitute is mostly required. The saphenous vein is usually the conduit of choice. The patency rates are high for reconstruction with saphenous vein and management of infections is more successful with this approach.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We prefer to use the contralateral saphenous vein because venous return may be critically jeopardized in cases, which may require the sacrifice of the ipsilateral vein. In cases, which lack saphenous vein of adequate diameter, arm veins can be preferred. Synthetic grafts are the last choices.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our series, there were three cases, which presented with acute limb ischemia within 48&#x000a0;h after surgery. Although they were salvaged with thrombectomy, ensuing infections with highly virulent bacteria led to inevitable amputations in two of the cases. It is possible that if a secondary intervention of thrombectomy had not been required, there would be no infections. In the current series, the perioperative period was not free of other complications. Hematoma and local infections are common complications in these procedures.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In accordance with previous reports, we believe that these complications occurred mainly because of large wounds, prolonged operation time, and a large amount of synthetic and metallic material used.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Likewise, recent papers report similar rates of infection in limb-sparing oncological surgery. The infection rate in skeletal sarcoma intervention is reported to range from 2.6 to 7.6%. When the intervention involves mainly soft tissue sarcomas, this rate may reach 30%.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The infection rate does not seem to rise when a vascular intervention is required. Therefore, we may emphasize that it is mainly the soft tissue component of surgery that relates to higher rates of infection.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p id="p0105">When the tumor invades the neurovascular bundle, the vein is in danger as well the artery. In trauma, complex venous injuries are frequently managed with ligation and the overall results are satisfactory. The long-term results of vein ligation in our trauma patients did not reveal any significant squeal of chronic venous insufficiency, and venous ligation had no detrimental effect on associated arterial repair.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The alternative routes of venous return possibly cover the role of the injured vein. Although a wide resection of muscle and skin is frequently required during oncological interventions and this may jeopardize the alternate venous routes, it seems that vein ligature is tolerated by these patients too.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Although the most frequent postoperative complication in our series was lower limb edema, they did not require any further intervention. Moreover, patients who had a venous ligature did not present with an advanced venous disease during the follow-up. There was only one patient, who presented with an active venous ulcer (C6). It is also shown that the patency rates for venous reconstruction are lower than for arterial ones. Moreover, the advantage of a venous reconstruction is mostly valid for the early period. Similar reports show that surgery both with venous reconstruction and without is safe and effective.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We do not prefer to perform a routine venous reconstruction because it extends the duration of surgery and its advantages are not clear. In case of large tumor resection and flap reconstruction, venous reconstruction was maintained to supply a better venous return and to avoid edema and congestion in the early postoperative period. In this series, two patients underwent vein reconstruction with synthetic graft because of the lack of an eligible autologous vein graft. However, one patient presented with thrombosis on the second postoperative day and finally infection. Although this infection did not lead to major amputation it prompted another intervention and removal of the infected synthetic graft.</p><p id="p0110">Patients with extremity sarcomas, which involve the main vessels, are at a higher risk for amputation, and not all patients are eligible for limb salvage procedures.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Nevertheless, recent papers concerning limb-sparing oncological surgery report a low rate of recurrence after surgery.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> In our series, there are three patients (3/17) (%17.6), who underwent a limb salvage surgery and had a local recurrence. During the follow-up, two of these three patients underwent a major amputation because of local recurrence. Moreover, extensive vascular involvement by extremity sarcoma raises a major concern regarding not only the risk of local recurrence after limb salvage surgery, but also an increased risk for metastatic disease.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The rate of metastasis was 17.6% in our series. Therefore a limb salvage procedure is more helpful in maintaining an acceptable life quality because the expected survival of these patients is low complicated with a remarkable recurrence rate.</p><p id="p0115">However, patency and limb salvage rates are physician-oriented outcome measures and may not necessarily reflect the contentment of the patient. Therefore, patient-oriented outcome measures such as quality of life assessments or functional outcome measures are required. In our study, we used ISOLS Criteria to evaluate the functional outcome of the salvaged limb. During the follow-up period, we have seen that 43% of our patients maintained an excellent or good function of the limb. The assessments show that motion and stability scores are mostly excellent or good. Nevertheless, the emotional acceptance scores are not as high as they are for other issues. It is possible that the burden of the disease is more evident in this category. This paper focuses on the functional outcome of a spared limb rather than the quality of life, therefore, we can only assume that maintaining a better functional outcome may be related to a better quality of life.</p><p id="p0120">This study has some limitation as; the patient group is heterogeneous in means of their diagnosis, a limited number of patients and relatively short follow-up period. The heterogeneous follow-up time could effect our results due to including the patients with short follow-up. The timing the evaluation patient clinical functional results at the final follow-up. A patient with a high functional score in the early postoperative period may not maintain his/her overall functional status in a long time due to several potential complications that might cause a negative affect on the scores in the long postoperative period.</p><p id="p0125">In conclusion, limb-sparing oncological surgery in musculoskeletal tumors with vascular invasion provides a satisfactory limb function, which may lead to an improved life quality. Arterial reconstruction, which is a major component of this approach, has a high rate of patency in the long term. The indication for a subsequent major amputation is the recurrence not ischemia in the long-term The surgeon should be aware of early perioperative complication related to vascular reconstruction and infection that effect on the rate of extremity survival.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflict of interest/funding</title><p id="p0130">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
