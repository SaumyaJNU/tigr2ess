The most prominent feature of the WRKY proteins is the 60 amino acid long WRKY domain, which comprises the highly conserved signature WRKYGQK followed by a C2H2- or C2HC-type of zinc-finger motif. Both heptapetide sequence and zinc-finger motif are required for the high binding affinity of WRKY TFs to the consensus W-box cis-elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on the number of WRKY domains and the structure of their zinc-finger motifs, the WRKY proteins can be classified into three main groups (I&#x02013;III), those with two WRKY domains belong to Group I, while those with one WRKY domain belong to Group II or III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Since the first WRKY gene, SPF1, was cloned from sweet potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], a large number of WRKY proteins have been experimentally identified from various plant species. Substantial evidence indicates that the WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant defense regulatory networks, including response to various biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The WRKY TFs are one of the best-characterized classes of plant defense transcription factors and at the forefront of research on plant defense responses. The WRKY proteins play a key role in plant defense against biotic stresses including bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A large number of WRKY TFs are induced by abiotic stresses and take part in the regulation of plant tolerance to abiotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, VvWRKY11 from grapevine is involved in the response to dehydration stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. AtWRKY75 is induced in the plant during phosphate deficiency while suppression of WRKY75 expression leads to the increased susceptibility to phosphate stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The WRKY proteins play central roles in various aspects of physiological processes, including senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], seed dormancy and germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], trichome development, modulation of flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], fruit flavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], biosynthesis of secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They are also key components in some signal transduction processes mediated by plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Arabidopsis WRKY39 positively regulates the cooperation between the SA- and JA-activated signaling pathways that mediate response to heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. OsWRKY31 mediates crosstalk between auxin and the defense signal transductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The WRKY proteins are conserved in evolutional history throughout the plant kingdom, and the expansions of this family seem to be related to the evolution and diversity of the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although WRKY TFs are considered as plant-specific, they were also reported in non-plant species, e.g. protist, slime mold, and unicellular algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The evolution of the WRKY gene family provide insights into how biotic and abiotic stress responses and signaling evolved as plant went from simpler, unicellular to more complex, multicellular flowering plants. The availability of increasing numbers of sequenced genomes has facilitated the evolutionary studies of the WRKY genes family, and large-scale genome-wide analysis of WRKY genes have been described in many different species, which would be helpful to understanding their evolutionary origin and biological functions.</p><p id="Par14">Pineapple, <italic>Ananas comosus</italic> (L.) Merr., is the only species of the Bromeliaceae family grown commercially for its fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. After banana and citrus, it is the third most important tropical fruit in world production, and is found in almost all the tropical and subtropical regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The environmental stresses significantly affect the growth and development of the pineapple plant. The pineapple fruit can be injured by sunburn under high temperature, the low temperature can result in diminished growth and the plant is usually severely damaged by frost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To a certain extent the pineapple can survive under drought conditions owing to the plant morphological features and its crassulacean acid metabolism. Nevertheless, prolonged extreme droughts affect growth and yield dramatically. The biotic stresses like pests, diseases, and weeds can also cause significant yield loss in plantation pineapple production. Additionally, pineapple is also an important species in the research of the monocot evolution owing to its pivotal phylogenetic position at the base of the order Poales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The pineapple is cultivated worldwide and has great economic and research value and so there is considerable interest in identifying important functional genes.</p><p id="Par15">The WRKY gene family has been extensively studied in many plant species. However, current basic knowledge of WRKY proteins in pineapple is still limited. Due to the importance of the WRKY genes in various physiological programs, it would be of interest to make a systematic investigation of the WRKY family in pineapple. Recent completion of the pineapple genome sequencing provided an opportunity to reveal the organization, expression and evolutionary traits of pineapple WRKY gene family at the genome-wide level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, we identified 54 pineapple <italic>WRKY</italic> genes and classified them into three main groups. The comprehensive analysis including the exon-intron organization, motif compositions, gene duplications, chromosome distribution, phylogenetic and synteny analysis were further investigated. Global expression analysis was performed to identify involvement of specific WRKY gene family members in different biological processes in pineapple. This study provided valuable clues for functional characterization of WRKY gene family members in pineapple.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of the WRKY proteins in pineapple</title><p id="Par16">A total of 56 candidate gene models corresponding to the Pfam WRKY family were originally obtained.

Ten erroneously predicted WRKY gene models were manually curated and two redundant sequences (<italic>Aco030791.1</italic> and <italic>Aco025780.1</italic>) were then removed. Finally, 54 gene models were selected and annotated as being pineapple <italic>WRKY</italic> genes based on the presence of apparently complete WRKY domains.

A total of 51 <italic>WRKY</italic> genes could be mapped on the linkage groups and were renamed from AcWRKY1 to AcWRKY51 based on their order on the linkage groups. Three <italic>WRKY</italic> genes (<italic>Aco027950.1</italic>, <italic>Aco028684.1</italic>, and <italic>Aco031477.1</italic>) that could not be conclusively mapped to any linkage groups were renamed AcWRKY52- AcWRKY54 respectively.</p><p id="Par17">Gene characteristics, including the length of the CDS (Coding Sequence), the length of the protein sequence, the protein molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI), and the subcellular localization were analyzed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Among the 54 AcWRKY proteins, AcWRKY14 was identified to be the smallest protein with 122 amino acid (aa), whereas the largest one was AcWRKY23 (1320 aa). The MW of the proteins ranged from 13.7 to 144.5&#x000a0;kDa, and the pI ranged from 5.11 (AcWRKY10) to 10.08 (AcWRKY54). The predicted subcellular localization results showed that 51 AcWRKY proteins were located in the nuclear region, whereas three proteins were located in the chloroplast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and classification of <italic>AcWRKY</italic> genes</title><p id="Par18">The phylogenetic relationship of the AcWRKY proteins was examined by multiple sequence alignment of their WRKY domains, which span approximately 60 amino acids. The WRKY domain of seven different Arabidopsis WRKY proteins (ATWRKY58, 40, 61, 50, 74, 65, 54) from each of the groups or subgroups, were randomly selected as representatives for the further comparison. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the sequences in the WRKY domain were highly conserved.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the 54 AcWRKY proteins, 12 belong to group I, 34 to group II, and 8 to group III. The 14 members from group I all contained two WRKY domains and C2H2-type zinc-finger motifs (C-X<sub>4</sub>-C-X<sub>22&#x02013;23</sub>-H-X-H), without the domain loss events which usually happened in some monocotyledonous species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The N-terminal and C-terminal WRKY domains were clustered in different clades, which may reflect the parallel evolution of the two domains. The WRKY members in group II can be further clustered into five subgroups (IIa-IIe), two WRKY proteins belong to IIa, 7 to IIb, <bold>13</bold> to IIc, 7 to IId, and 5 to IIe. Seven of the eight members in group III contain the C2HC-type zinc fingers (C-X<sub>7&#x02212;</sub>C-X<sub>23</sub>-H-X-C), whereas the remaining AcWRKY14 possess a C2H2 type of zinc finger motif. The extended WRKY domains, which were found in several group III WRKY proteins in some monocot species like rice and Brachypodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], were not observed in pineapple.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Unrooted phylogenetic tree representing relationships among WRKY domains of pineapple and Arabidopsis.

A phylogenetic tree of WRKY III complete protein sequences from ten representative species, including six monocots (pineapple, rice, maize, banana, Brachypodium and millet) and four dicots (Arabidopsis, grape, tomato and poplar), was constructed using MEGA 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">As indicated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the WRKY III proteins were divided in to seven clades by the phylogenetic tree.

WRKY members from the phylogenetically closer species were clustered together within the two clades. For example, Clade 1a contained member from dicots, Clade 1b possessed member from pineapple and banana, the non-grass monocots, whereas Clade 1c contained proteins only from the grass species. Additionally, Clade 3 contained the grass-species specific WRKY members. Nine WRKY genes from eight different species were included in Clade 4, indicating that they might be orthologues that originated from a single ancestral gene.

However, WRKY proteins from group I in pineapple all have two WRKY domains, and no domain loss events were found, suggesting the different characteristics of this group during pineapple evolution. It is reported that the N-terminal WRKY domains showed weak DNA-binding activity and were more variable during evolution. Consisted with previous studies, the pineapple WRKY trees clustered the N-terminal WRKY domains as a monophyletic subtree (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that the single WRKY domains of group II and III family members are more closely related to the C-terminal domains of group I than to the N-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Comparison of the number of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes in pineapple with other sequenced monocot genomes has shown that pineapple possesses comparatively lesser number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

In this study, eight group III <italic>AcWRKY</italic> genes were fewer than that in most other monocots, consistent with the smaller amount of pineapple WRKY family members.

The phylogenetic analysis of the WRKY III proteins could provide more clues about the evolution history of the WRKY gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In our study, the plant WRKY III members from the closer related species were tended to be clustered together.

The presence of the grasses-specific clade (Clade 3) indicated that the WRKY III genes may have been expanded independently in grasses after the divergence of pineapple and grasses during the Poales evolution.
