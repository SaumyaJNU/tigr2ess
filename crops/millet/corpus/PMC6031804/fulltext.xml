Vitamin D has proved to exert numerous tumor suppressive effects. Effects of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on tumor progression are still controversial. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of BM-MSCs and vitamin D on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in an experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model in rats.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The study was conducted on fifty female white albino rats divided equally into 5 groups: controls, HCC induced by diethyl-nitrosamine (DENA) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), HCC plus MSCs, HCC plus vitamin D and HCC plus both MSCs and vitamin D. The following parameters were assessed in rat liver tissues: TGF-&#x003b2; and Smad2 protein levels by ELISA and western blotting, respectively, gene expression of Smad3, Smad7, Snail, HNF4&#x003b1; and MMP-2 and histopathological lesions. Serum levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), ALT and albumin were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>TGF-&#x003b2; protein levels and gene expression of its downstream effectors (Smad3 and Snail), in addition to Smad2 protein levels were significantly higher in the HCC group than in the control group. On the other hand, they were significantly down-regulated in all treated groups with most significant amelioration with both MSCs and vitamin D. Also, the serum levels of AFP were significantly increased in the untreated HCC group, and this was again reversed in all treated groups. Histopathological examination of liver tissue revealed that administration of MSCs or vitamin D into HCC rat group improved the histopathological picture with residual tumor pathology, while administration of both MSCs and vitamin D showed better restoration of liver parenchyma. These data suggest that the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway could be used as a therapeutic target in HCC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HCC-TGF-&#x003b2;</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>MSCs</kwd><kwd>Vitamin D</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), originating from epithelium of hepatocytes and accounting for 80% of primary liver cancers, ranks as 4th place in causing tumor-related deaths globally. Abnormal activation of molecular signaling pathways contributes to initiation and progression of liver cancer (Chen and Wang, 2015).</p><p>The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways play essential roles in regulating cell growth, differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, angiogenesis, immune response, apoptosis, motility and invasion (Wakefield and Hill, 2013). Dysregulated TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathways play crucial roles in malignant tumor development and metastasis. There are growing evidence pointing to the role of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in HCC initiation and promotion. The TGF-&#x003b2; signaling occurs via a canonical and a non-canonical pathway. The canonical TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway activation leads to downstream SMADs signaling cascade initiation resulting in nuclear translocation and gene transcription for a wide range of tumor-promoting genes (Heldin and Moustakas, 2012). The less-known non-canonical activation pathway is associated with several intracellular phosphorylation of proteins, such as jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, ERK, or MEKK. MEK, ERK, AKT, mTOR and PTEN (Fransvea et al., 2011). This suggests that TGF&#x003b2; signaling has several mechanisms to activate either the tumor cell or cells of the microenvironment.</p><p>Regarding MSCs, several studies reported that MSCs have both stimulating and inhibiting effects on tumor progression. The outcome of the intricate signaling network and crosstalk between MSCs and tumor micro-environmental cells determine whether MSCs will undergo stimulating or inhibiting effects on tumor progression. Barcellos-de-Souza et al., (2013) attributed the anti-neoplastic properties of MSCs due to AKT inactivation. Yulyana et al., (2015) reported similar findings in HCC cell lines where the authors stated that MSCs conditioned medium inhibited insulin like growth factor (IGF) signaling cascade and subsequent disruption of the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling events.</p><p>Moreover, BM-MSCs inhibit the in vivo tumor growth and in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells through the secretion of oncostatin-M, a differentiation-promoting cytokine, that exerts anti-proliferative effects against several types of cancers (Wang et al., 2012).</p><p>On the other hand, Vitamin D has significant anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-differentiative effects in a broad range of malignant tumors (Deeb et al., 2007). These effects are mediated through affecting several signaling pathways mediated through genomic and epigenomic mechanisms. The effects of 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and its metabolites have been shown to function through regulation of proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis (Wang and Studzinski, 2001). Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> potentiates the anti-tumour effects of many chemotherapeutic drugs, and several clinical trials showed that the administration of high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and its analogues is feasible, safe and has significant therapeutic potentials.</p><p>The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of BM-MSCs with or without use of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in experimental HCC in rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study was conducted in the Unit of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the Medical Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of experimental animal model</title><p>This study included fifty female adult albino rats, inbred strain (Cux1: HEL1) of matched age and weight (6 months-1 year and 120-150gm) (Abdel Aziz et al., 2011).

TGF-&#x003b2; signaling has been increasingly recognized as a key driver in cancer. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of BM-MSCs and/or vitamin D on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats.</p><p>Results of the present study showed that there was a significant elevation in TGF-&#x003b2; protein level and its downstream target gene expressions (Smad3 and Snail) in HCC rat group. There was also a significant elevation in Smad2 protein levels in the rat liver tissues in HCC rat group as compared to the control group. Gianluigi et al., (2014) reported similar findings. The authors stated that TGF-&#x003b2; plays an important role in orchestrating a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and promoting epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-&#x003b2; signaling promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by two mechanisms: first, via an intrinsic activity as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor and, second, via an extrinsic activity by inducing microenvironment changes, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, T regulatory cells, and inflammatory mediators. Also, Moon et al., (2017) found that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling activated transcription of the Snail gene in liver tumors declaring that Snail is the TGF-&#x003b2; target that is required for hepatic tumorigenesis. As regards Smad3, Millet and Zhang, (2007) confirmed the pro-oncogenic activities of Smad3 during the late stages of carcinogenesis. Smad3 is essential for TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;mediated immune suppression, and it regulates transcriptional responses that are favorable to EMT and enhancing cell migration and transcription of factors favorable to metastasis.</p><p>On the other hand, Zhang et al., (2017) demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;1 inhibits the growth and development of HCC cells by targeting the Hippo signaling pathway through the regulation of a series of key proteins. The Hippo pathway inhibited the HCC cells growth and the inhibitory effect was stronger than the enhancing effect of TGF-&#x003b2;/smad2/3 signaling pathway.</p><p>HCC rat group treated with either MSCs only or treated with vitamin D only showed a significant decrease in the TGF-&#x003b2; levels and the gene expression of both Smad3 and Snail as compared to the untreated HCC rat group. Whereas Smad2 protein level exhibited a significant decrease in the HCC group treated with MSCs only as compared to the untreated HCC group.</p><p>As regards MSCs effects on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, our findings coincided with those reported by Zhang et al., (2015) who stated that BM-MSCs inhibit the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells by inhibiting the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway in advanced liver disease. Moreover, Li et al., (2010) stated that MSCs enhanced tumor growth but significantly inhibited the invasiveness and metastasis of HCC, possibly through downregulation of TGF-&#x003b2;1. On the contrary, Tang et al., (2015) stated that although MSCs secrete TGF-&#x003b2; in experimental colorectal cancer model, this effect is beneficial by inhibiting the chronic inflammatory state in malignant neoplasms because of the induction of differentiation of the regulatory T cells (Treg cells) with significant potential anti-inflammatory effect. Also Li et al., (2016) found that MSCs were able to enhance the expression of TGF&#x003b2;1 mRNA, however, inhibited the expression of Smad7 mRNA. Moreover, TGF&#x003b2;1 mRNA expression levels correlated with the microvessel density (MVD) of the HCC suggesting that MSCs may promote tumor angiogenesis via the TGF&#x003b2;1/Smad signaling pathway.</p><p>As regards Smad7 there was a significant decrease in gene expression in HCC group as compared to control. While there was a significant increase in all treated groups compared to the untreated HCC group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in Smad7 gene expression in HCC rat treated with both MSCs and vitamin D as compared to both HCC treated rat groups that received either MSCs or Vitamin D only. Stolfi et al., (2013) stated that Smad7 was initially identified as an inhibitor of TGF-&#x003b2; due mainly to its ability to bind TGF-&#x003b2; receptor type I and prevent TGF-&#x003b2;-associated Smads signaling. Moreover, Wang et al., (2013) proved the role of Smad7 in hepatocarcinogenesis in mice and in vitro. These studies could explain our findings of the decreased Smad7 levels in HCC rat group. Whereas Li et al, (2016) demonstrated that MSCs inhibited the expression of Smad7 mRNA.</p><p>Chen et al., (2015) proved that 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited TGF-&#x003b2;1/&#x003b2;2 in SW-480 and HT-29 cancer cell lines. TGF-&#x003b2;1/&#x003b2;2-induced increased expression of EMT-related transcription factors was also inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3. These findings agree with our results that demonstrate the suppressor effect of Vitamin D on TGF-&#x003b2; and its downstream target genes.</p><p>As regards effect of combined administration of vitamin D and MSCs on HCC model, Artaza et al., (2009), stated that exposing mesenchymal stem cells to the active form of vitamin D led to the decreased expression of TGF-B1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (SERPINE1) which are considered as two well-known pro-fibrotic factors. These data could explain our findings of the significant inhibitory effect on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by the combined use of Vitamin D and MSCs in HCC group than the use of either Vitamin D or MSCs separately.</p><p>As regards, MMP-2, our results demonstrated that the expression of MMP-2 was significantly increased in the HCC group of animal model compared to control group. Whereas, there was a significant decrease in the gene expression of MMP-2 in all treated groups compared to the HCC group. These findings agreed with those reported by Li et al., (2015) who indicated a positive feedback loop between activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 and MMP-2. MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteolytically cleave latent TGF-&#x003b2;, providing a potentially important mechanism for TGF-&#x003b2; activation. Conversely, TGF-&#x003b2; can induce expression of MMP-2 through the TGF&#x003b2;/Smad pathway. The results of the present study also agreed with Luong and Nguyen (2013) who demonstrated that calcitriol inhibited endometrial cancer cell growth and was associated with decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Vitamin D analogs have also been shown to decrease MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion (Iglesias-gato et al., 2011; Stio et al., 2011).</p><p>The current study revealed that HNF4&#x003b1; expression was significantly decreased in the HCC group compared to the control group. Whereas, there was a significant increase in the expression of this gene in HCC group that received MSCs only and HCC group that received both MSCs and vitamin D compared to the HCC group. These results agreed with findings reported by Cozzolino et al., (2013) who stated that TGF-&#x003b2; overrides HNF4&#x003b1; tumor suppressing activity through GSK3&#x003b2; inactivation with subsequent potentiation of tumor dedifferentiation, induction of EMT and acquisition of metastatic properties.</p><p>In conclusion downregulation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling could be achieved by administration of MSCs or vitamin D in chemically induced HCC rats. Administration of both MSCs and vitamin D showed more significant suppressive effect on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and more improvement of pathological picture. These data suggest that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway could be used as a therapeutic target in HCC.</p><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Conflict of Interest:</title><p>The authors declared no conflict of
