We have previously reported that in human cells one member of this family, GIMAP6, interacts with the ATG8 family member GABARAPL2, and is recruited to autophagosomes upon starvation, suggesting a role for GIMAP6 in the autophagic process. To study this possibility and the function of GIMAP6 in the immune system, we have established a mouse line in which the <italic>Gimap6</italic> gene can be inactivated by Cre-mediated recombination. In mice bred to carry the CD2Cre transgene such that the <italic>Gimap6</italic> gene was deleted within the T and B cell lineages there was a 50&#x02013;70% reduction in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Analysis of splenocyte-derived proteins from these mice indicated increased levels of MAP1LC3B, particularly the lipidated LC3-II form, and S405-phosphorylation of SQSTM1. Electron microscopic measurements of <italic>Gimap6</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells indicated an increased mitochondrial/cytoplasmic volume ratio and increased numbers of autophagosomes. These results are consistent with autophagic disruption in the cells. However, <italic>Gimap6</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> T cells were largely normal in character, could be effectively activated <italic>in vitro</italic> and supported T cell-dependent antibody production. Treatment <italic>in vitro</italic> of CD4<sup>+</sup> splenocytes from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre mice with 4-hydroxytamoxifen resulted in the disappearance of GIMAP6 within five days. In parallel, increased phosphorylation of SQSTM1 and TBK1 was observed. These results indicate a requirement for GIMAP6 in the maintenance of a normal peripheral adaptive immune system and a significant role for the protein in normal autophagic processes. Moreover, as GIMAP6 is expressed in a cell-selective manner, this indicates the potential existence of a cell-restricted mode of autophagic regulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3423-7124</contrib-id><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Geoffrey W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3423-7124</contrib-id><name><surname>Butcher</surname><given-names>Geoffrey W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by grant numbers BBS/E/B/000C0407 and BBS/E/B/000C0427 from The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UK) to Dr Geoffrey W Butcher.

The first member of the family, termed AIG1 (<underline>a</underline>vrRpt2-<underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>g</underline>ene 1), was identified in the plant species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, where it is induced in response to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to plants, members of the family have also been identified in a restricted number of other groups including protists [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], coral [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and molluscs [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], (but not in e.g. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and throughout vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, in addition to the induction of AIG1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by infection, in both coral [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and molluscs [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] AIG1 family members are also induced by pathogenic challenge, suggesting that they may have a significant role in conferring resistance to infection. The link to host defence is further conserved in vertebrates, where the AIG1 family of GTPases is represented by the GIMAP family of proteins and expression of these is most prominent in cells of the adaptive immune system [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In mammals, the GIMAP family comprises 7&#x02013;8 members (species-dependent) which are closely linked at a single locus (chromosome 7 in human, 6 in mouse) [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The family can be split into two groups, depending on the presence or absence of membrane-anchoring domains. In mouse, GIMAPs 1, 3 and 5 are membrane-anchored, whereas GIMAPs 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are soluble proteins (see [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In structural terms, GIMAPs have been placed in the non-Ras class of G proteins alongside septins and dynamins with which they share mechanisms of GTPase activation via molecular dimerization (including heterologous interactions within the GIMAP family). A role in molecular scaffold formation on intracellular membranes has been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Historically, GIMAP5 has attracted the most research attention. Non-functional mutations of <italic>Gimap5</italic> in both rats and mice are associated with severe peripheral T cell lymphopenia and increased susceptibility to autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, targeted mutations introduced into the genes encoding other GIMAP membrane-anchored proteins present in mice, namely GIMAP1 [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and GIMAP3 [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], also have an impact on T cell phenotypes, although that associated with GIMAP3 is only seen clearly in the presence of an additional <italic>Gimap5</italic> mutation [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Moreover, GIMAP6 was recruited to autophagosomes upon stimulation of autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], perhaps via its interaction with GABARAPL2. This suggested either that GIMAP6 was selectively degraded by the autophagic pathway or, more interestingly, that it played a functional role in autophagy. However, we were unable to demonstrate any changes associated with altering the expression of GIMAP6 in cell lines. We also made the unexpected observation that the interaction of mouse GIMAP6 with GABARAPL2 was very weak, which we showed was due to the absence from mouse GIMAP6 of a critical domain required for the strong interaction of the human protein with GABARAPL2 [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The absence of a strong interaction between mouse GIMAP6 and GABARAPL2 raises the question of whether GIMAP6 plays any functional role in mice.

To address this issue, HEK293 cells were engineered to over-express a myc-tagged variant of mouse GIMAP6. In untreated cells GIMAP6 showed a uniform cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels a and g and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196504.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Maintenance of cells for 90 minutes either in starvation medium or, to a lesser extent, treatment of the cells with bafilomycin A (BafA), led to the formation of small punctate structures in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196504.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). When the two cell treatments were combined, the GIMAP6 protein showed a strongly staining punctate distribution in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Panels d and j and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196504.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Co-staining of the cells with antibodies to either MAP1LC3B (a classic marker for autophagosomes) (panels b and e) or SQSTM1 (Panels h and k), both of which are recruited to autophagosomes on starvation, demonstrated that they too redistributed from a largely cytosolic to a more punctate appearance upon starvation in the presence of BafA. Moreover, inspection of the spot distribution showed clear (although not complete) co-localisation between GIMAP6 and MAP1LC3B (Panel f), and between GIMAP6 and SQSTM1 (Panel l), indicating that mouse GIMAP6, similar to its human counterpart, relocates, at least in part, to vesicles showing characteristics of autophagosomes. As these results suggested that GIMAP6 might traffic in association with autophagosomal vesicles, the question of whether GIMAP6 could be detected with lysosomes (representing the end of the autophagy flux pathway) was investigated. However, no co-localization of GIMAP6 with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 could be demonstrated either in resting cells or in cells in which autophagy had been stimulated by starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196504.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0196504.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196504.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>GIMAP6 relocalises to autophagosomes on cell starvation.</title><p>HEK293 cells stably expressing an N-terminally myc-tagged variant of mouse GIMAP6 were either left untreated or were treated with starvation buffer for 90 minutes.

Although we have previously failed to demonstrate any functional effects of increasing cellular levels of GIMAP6 in established human cell lines, despite demonstrating localisation of the protein to autophagosomes upon starvation of those cells [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we were interested to determine whether GIMAP6 might have an effect on the process of autophagy in primary cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-, CD8<sup>+</sup> T- and B cell-enriched populations were isolated from the spleens of GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> (control) and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre (knockout) mice, cellular lysates prepared and the proteins analysed by western blotting. Immunoblots using monoclonal antibodies to mouse GIMAP6 confirmed the absence of the protein from knockout lymphocyte sub-population cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, when probed with an antibody to the autophagosome marker MAP1LC3B (which reacts with two protein variants, LC3-I and -II), levels were higher in cells from the knockout animals than from the control mice, particularly in the case of the LC3-II species. This was particularly apparent in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations but rather less so in B cells. The LC3-II species is derived from LC3-I by lipidation during autophagy (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) and becomes associated with autophagosome membranes. Levels of the LC3-II species correlate with the number of autophagosomes in a cell [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; therefore, an increase in the levels of LC3-II in lymphocytes in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice is consistent with an increase in the number of autophagosomes in cells from these knockout animals. As these studies had been performed using lymphocyte lysates generated from pooled animals (routinely three in each group), CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and B cell populations were also isolated from individual mice (one cell type per mouse) to allow statistical analysis of the LC3-II/ACTIN ratios. CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and B cells from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre knockout mice showed significantly higher LC3-II/ACTIN ratios than the corresponding cells from the control GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0196504.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196504.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Expression levels of proteins in enriched lymphocyte fractions from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> CD2Cre mice.</title><p>Panel A) CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and B cell enriched fractions were isolated from splenocytes from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice.

Analysis of the levels of a second protein, SQSTM1, can help to distinguish between these possibilities. If autophagic flux is increased, levels of SQSTM1 will reduce, as it is transported through the autophagic pathway for eventual degradation. In contrast, if the autophagic pathway is inhibited, SQSTM1 levels will tend to increase. Therefore, lysates from CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and B cells from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals were analysed for SQSTM1 levels by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The knockout animals showed no reduction in the level of the protein compared with the control mice, suggesting that the absence of GIMAP6 did not increase flux of SQSTM1 through the autophagic pathway. However, although the total amount of SQSTM1 did not appear to be reduced in the knockout animals, it was now split into two distinct species with an additional species of slightly lower mobility being observed, in addition to the normal product (large arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). SQSTM1 has been reported to undergo phosphorylation at several sites in response to a range of signals. Of note, phosphorylation at residue serine-405 (corresponding to serine-403 in humans) has been demonstrated to occur during disruption of autophagic processes [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An antibody specific for this phosphorylated residue in SQSTM1 was therefore used to test the possibility that this was the modification associated with the <italic>Gimap6</italic> gene inactivation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, lysates from all three lymphocyte populations from the knockout animals contained a species reactive with this antibody and having a mobility consistent with it being the upper band observed using the general anti-SQSTM1 antibody discussed above. This species was undetectable in lysates from the control mice, indicating a specific accumulation of the phosphoserine-405 variant of SQSTM1 in the lymphocytes lacking GIMAP6. Interestingly, phosphatase treatment of cell lysates from either GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> or GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice resulted in a band shift to lower molecular weight of the SQSTM1 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0196504.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that even in control animals some residues in SQSTM1 are phosphorylated, although not at serine-405. Overall, it is apparent that GIMAP6 regulates autophagic turnover of SQSTM1 in a process involving phosphorylation of the protein. However, because only small changes in the levels of total SQSTM1 were observed, it remains unclear whether GIMAP6 ablation increases or reduces autophagy in these cells.</p><p>As a second method of investigating the effect of GIMAP6 on flux through the autophagic pathway, freshly isolated splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from both GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals were cultured in the absence or presence of the autophagy inhibitor BafA. BafA causes a block late in autophagy and so prevents LC3 turnover. Thus, the difference between the accumulation of LC3-II in the presence or absence of the inhibitor is a measure of the flux through the pathway. A typical result obtained is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3C</xref>. In the absence of BafA, consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, LC3-II levels were higher in the cells from the knockout GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals than from the control animals. In the presence of the inhibitor, a large increase in LC3-II levels was observed in the cells from the control animals, consistent with the blockade of autophagic flux by the inhibitor. In contrast, treatment of cells from knockout animals with BafA caused only a small (statistically insignificant&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3C</xref> right-hand panel) increase in LC3-II levels compared with untreated cells. Since the background levels of LC3 were so different between cells from control and knockout animals, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about GIMAP6 function from these data. Nevertheless, if BafA inhibition can cause an increase, albeit small, in LC3-II levels in the knockout cells, this would indicate that the absence of GIMAP6 does not cause a complete block in the autophagic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>The impact of GIMAP6 ablation on mitochondrial load</title><p>Autophagy serves not only to recycle intracellular components in cells in a relatively non-specific manner, but also has a key role in clearing specific organelles. For example, the autophagic pathway is required to remove mitochondria from reticulocytes during their maturation to erythrocytes [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a process termed mitophagy. Similarly, a developmentally regulated reduction in mitochondrial content dependent upon mitophagy has been proposed for the T cell lineage at the stage where cells migrate from the thymus to secondary lymphoid tissues (blood, spleen, lymph nodes); in mice in which components of the autophagic system have been ablated, a reduction in T cell numbers is observed [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], perhaps because of the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species.

In addition, occasional mitochondrial spheroids were observed in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre derived cells, which are suggestive of mitochondrial malfunctioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g004">Fig 4A</xref> panel e&#x02014;asterisked) [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although a single spheroid was also observed in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> derived cells. The electron microscopic analyses also showed, firstly, an increase in the cytoplasmic area per nucleated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and, secondly, an increase in the number of autophagosomes per cell profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) (in agreement with the increased levels of LC3-II measured&#x02014;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g003">Fig 3</xref>), although, owing to the low numbers seen, the latter could not be analysed statistically.

To try to separate the components two approaches were used. Firstly, we used the fact that early thymic emigrants express the surface antigen CD24 which reduces over time in circulating peripheral cells (see e.g.[<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Splenocytes isolated from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals were stained with antibodies to CD4 and CD24 and the level of CD24 staining of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells assessed by flow cytometry. A typical staining distribution pattern is shown in the left hand panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. The CD4 cells from the knockout mice showed higher levels of staining than those from the control animals. This result was borne out by analysis of multiple animals, where a consistent increase in the median fluorescence intensity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6A</xref> right hand panel). These results would indicate that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the knockout GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals had a younger age profile than those from the control animals, suggesting that thymic output was not reduced in the knockout animals but that the turnover rate of older cells was increased. As a second approach, the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibiting signs of early apoptosis was measured in freshly isolated splenocytes by staining with annexin V and DAPI. In this assay, cells in early apoptosis appear as annexin V<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>-</sup>. Typical staining profiles for GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals are shown in the two left-most panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6B</xref>. Analysis of multiple animals of each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6B</xref> right-hand panel) indicated a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells in the early apoptotic phase (annexin V<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>-</sup>&#x02014;corresponding to quadrant Q3) in knockout mice compared with the control animals, a result consistent with higher levels of apoptosis in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of the knockout animals, and thus with faster turn-over of the cells. A similar result was obtained when na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were cultured in resting conditions for 24 h before analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6C</xref> left hand panel). Together these results suggest that the reduction of the numbers of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells observed in the knockout animals arises because of increased rates of apoptosis rather than reduced production. Surprisingly, when na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated <italic>in vitro</italic> by treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 24h before apoptotic analysis, cells from control and knockout animals behaved similarly, with a large increase in cell death (annexin V<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>+</sup>) compared with resting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g006">Fig 6C</xref> right hand panel) (a phenomenon known as activation-induced cell death&#x02013;see e.g [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]).</p><fig id="pone.0196504.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196504.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>The reduced number of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice reflects an increase in apoptosis.</title><p>A) Splenocytes isolated from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> and GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals were stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD4 and CD24.

However, as the percentage and number of both splenic and lymph node T cells were reduced in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice, the possibility remained that at least some of the results obtained could be due to the selection of residual populations of lymphocytes with changed properties. We therefore concluded that it would be instructive/informative to study the impact of GIMAP6 loss in T cells shortly after ablation of the gene.</p><p>Our laboratory has previously reported the use of an inducible knockout system to ablate the <italic>Gimap1</italic> gene in a temporally controlled manner [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] using a tamoxifen-regulated Cre recombinase. A similar approach was adopted here to create a temporally controllable <italic>Gimap6</italic> knockout system. Mice carrying the ERT2Cre transgene were crossed to GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> animals to generate GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice carrying a single copy of the ERT2Cre gene (termed GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre). Primary cells from these mice were used <italic>in vitro</italic> to study the acute effects of ablation of <italic>Gimap6</italic>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the mice and from mice carrying a single copy of the ERT2Cre gene (as controls) were cultured with or without the active tamoxifen analogue 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) for five days. This treatment had no effect on the levels of GIMAP6 protein in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the ERT2Cre mice. In contrast, in cells from the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre animals, immunoreactive GIMAP6 protein was reduced to barely detectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), consistent with the targeted deletion of the <italic>Gimap6</italic> gene by the 4HT-activated ERT2Cre, and the subsequent turnover of already synthesised <italic>Gimap6</italic> mRNA and GIMAP6 protein. When some key autophagic markers were examined by western blotting, S405-phosphorylation of SQSTM1, and the associated additional SQSTM1 species previously observed in the GIMAP6 CD2Cre animals, were found to be present in the 4HT-treated GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> cells but not in any other cell/treatment combination. However, in contrast to the situation in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre animals (described above), no increase in the levels of LC3 was observed.

Associated with the activation of TBK1 is its phosphorylation on serine-172. We therefore used this phosphorylation event to investigate whether TBK1 was activated after targeted deletion of the <italic>Gimap6</italic> gene in 4HT-treated GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Phosphorylation of the serine-172 residue was higher in these cells after five days of treatment with 4HT than in untreated cells of the same genotype or in untreated or treated cells from ERT2Cre animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), indicating that the TBK1 enzyme had been activated. Although this result was somewhat complicated by the relatively high basal level of TBK1 phosphorylation observed in cells immediately following isolation, it suggested that TBK1 may be responsible for at least some of the observed phosphorylation of SQSTM1 at serine-405.</p><p>To investigate this further, the time-courses of GIMAP6 disappearance and the associated phosphorylation of SQSTM1 and TBK1 were followed after treatment of GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with 4HT. GIMAP6 was detectably reduced after three days of treatment when compared with untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). At this time-point, phosphorylation of both SQSTM1 and TBK1 first became detectable above the background levels present in untreated cells. As the level of GIMAP6 reduced further between three and five days of treatment, levels of phosphorylation of both SQSTM1 and TBK1 increased. Beyond five days no further consistent changes were observed. Thus, activation of TBK1 and phosphorylation of SQSTM1 correlated temporally with the disappearance of GIMAP6. Moreover, when 4HT-treated GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were additionally treated with the TBK1 inhibitor BX795 [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for 6h after 4 days of 4HT treatment, S405 phosphorylation of SQSTM1 was essentially eliminated compared with vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196504.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). This provides strong evidence that TBK1 is at least partially responsible for the observed increase in S405-SQSTM1 phosphorylation following GIMAP6 ablation, although the functional significance of this to the regulation of autophagy remains unclear. Surprisingly, using the anti-SQSTM1 antibody, an upper species of SQSTM1 was still observed after BX795 treatment, suggesting the generation of additional SQSTM1 phospho-forms, presumably either at very stable phosphorylation sites or catalysed by enzymes other than TBK1.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>The GIMAP family of GTPases has been shown to be required for a normal mammalian peripheral lymphocyte system.

Moreover, as discussed above, deletion of either the <italic>Gimap4</italic> or <italic>Gimap8</italic> genes reduces the sensitivity of T cells to apoptosis&#x02013;inducing agents <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, work published whilst this manuscript was in preparation has suggested a role for GIMAP6 in the regulation of apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However in contrast to GIMAPs 3, 4 and 5 reported on by Nitta and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Ho and colleagues were unable to demonstrate an interaction of GIMAP6 with any obvious apoptosis-associated protein, raising the possibility that GIMAP6 may be inducing apoptosis by a distinct route. This possibility has been strengthened by genetic and cellular studies of the lymphopenias and cell death associated with GIMAP5 and GIMAP1 deficiencies [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] which cast doubt on the involvement of the BCL2-related apoptotic machinery in the lymphopenias.</p><p>Further clues as to how GIMAP proteins may function has come from studies of their intracellular locations. Work from our laboratory has indicated that GIMAP1 is located principally in the Golgi apparatus, and GIMAP5 on lysosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, GIMAP2 (a GIMAP family member found in humans but absent from rodents) is located on lipid droplets to which it recruits GIMAP7 [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These results may suggest a role for the GIMAP proteins in vesicular or lipid droplet trafficking or localised regulation of organelles. In the latter regard, it has recently been demonstrated that GIMAP5 regulates the levels of intra-luminal calcium in lysosomes in T cells [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], although it has also been shown that GIMAP5 can regulate mitochondrial integrity from a remote location [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Consistent with a possible role in calcium homeostasis, it has been demonstrated that T lymphocytes from a rat strain bearing the <italic>lyp</italic> mutant <italic>Gimap5</italic> gene show impaired calcium signalling [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further work suggesting another potential mode of action of GIMAP5 has very recently been published. In this work, GIMAP5 has been shown to regulate the recruitment of glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; to vesicular structures (possibly MVBs) to inactivate the kinase. In the absence of GIMAP5, inactivation of the enzyme is impaired, leading to a failure in T cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Can we fit our new data with GIMAP6 into any of these models? Firstly, we have previously demonstrated that human GIMAP6 is recruited to autophagosomal vesicles upon the induction of autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and in the current study we confirm that this also applies to mouse GIMAP6. It seems likely, therefore, that recruitment of GIMAP6 to autophagosomes is key to its function, as it is conserved even by the mouse protein, despite it lacking the principal domain required for GABARAPL2 interaction. Thus, GIMAP6 is another member of the GIMAP family that may fulfil its function by association with membranes.</p><p>What is GIMAP6 doing at the level of autophagosomes? The accumulation <italic>in vivo</italic> of LC3-II in lymphocytes from GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre mice is suggestive of a change in the process of basal autophagy. Similarly, the increased mitochondrial/cytoplasmic volume ratio we report might reflect a failure of the autophagic pathway to clear faulty mitochondria. It is of interest to address the fact that the accumulation of LC3-II seen <italic>in vivo</italic> in the GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre model was not observed <italic>in vitro</italic> in the inducible knockout GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>ERT2Cre system; by contrast, the increase in S405-phosphorylation of SQSTM1 was prominent and already detectable by day 3 after initiation of gene ablation. We ascribe this difference between the two systems to timescale: we suggest that the developmentally-regulated ablation of <italic>Gimap6</italic> in GIMAP6<sup>fl/fl</sup>CD2Cre lymphocytes leads to a gradual accumulation of LC3-II-bearing autophagosomal vesicles over a long period (weeks) <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas the period of days to which our inducible <italic>in vitro Gimap6</italic> KO system is limited is insufficient to display such a change. On the other hand, the rapid change in the phosphorylation state of SQSTM1 suggests that this feature is highly sensitive to change in autophagosomal efficiency, perhaps through being especially attuned to any disruption of mitochondrial quality control.</p><p>As we have demonstrated that the SQSTM1 phosphorylation is at least in part mediated by TBK1, it is possible that GIMAP6 affects the phosphorylation and activation of that enzyme. It has previously been reported that activation of PINK1 and PARKIN by mitochondrial depolarization can lead to TBK1 phosphorylation. If GIMAP6 modulates this process, this could result in a change in the consequential TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of SQSTM1, with downstream effects on both the processes of autophagy and mitophagy.</p><p>Disruption of autophagy by targeted ablation of the autophagy protein Atg5 has been demonstrated to result in increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell death and a failure of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to proliferate after T cell receptor stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, Atg7 is required not only for peripheral T cell survival but also for the loss of mitochondria that occurs as T cells passage from the thymus to the periphery [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These authors suggest that it is this failure to lose mitochondria which results in the peripheral T cell death. We similarly speculate that the peripheral T cell lymphopenia seen in the <italic>Gimap6</italic> knock-out mice arises because of a reduction in autophagic flux leading to a failure of normal mitochondrial clearance.</p><p>Although our data point strongly to a role for GIMAP6 in the autophagic pathway, the level at which that occurs remains unclear. Formation of autophagosomes (as assessed by MAP1LC3B accumulation and electron microscopy) occurs, suggesting that the early stages of autophagic vesicle formation proceed normally and that GIMAP6 therefore modulates autophagy later in the pathway. Whereas many proteins have been characterised that are involved in autophagosome formation/sealing, fewer have been characterised that are important later in the pathway. One of the best studied is RAB7. RAB7 is required for the late maturation of autophagosomes and possibly their fusion with lysosomes [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. T cell-specific ablation of RAB7 results in the accumulation of the lipidated form of MAP1LC3B, and inhibitor-mediated blockade of autophagy causes only a small further increase in this lipidated protein [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], in a manner similar to that reported in this paper for GIMAP6. This suggests that GIMAP6 and RAB7 may act at similar points in the autophagy pathway. Recent work has supported this idea by demonstrating the recruitment of GIMAP4, GIMAP5 and GIMAP6 to the parasitophorous vacuoles of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infected cells to facilitate fusion of the vacuoles to lysosomes for parasite destruction [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, a more detailed analysis of the later steps of autophagy in lymphocytes lacking GIMAP6 will be required to identify the exact point at which the protein acts.</p><p>One of the key remaining questions is why lymphocytes, and in particular T cells, should have acquired an additional control mechanism for autophagy (i.e. GIMAP6) operating in a cell type-selective manner, given that autophagy is a universal process throughout eukaryotes. We are unaware of many precedents for this. It has been suggested that the microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B, may have a particular role in autophagy in neurons where it is expressed at high levels, although it is expressed widely in other cell types [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similarly, pleckstrin homology domain containing family member 1, PLEKHM1, which has recently been shown to regulate autophagosome-lysosome fusion, although expressed widely, appears to be particularly important in the regulation of the function of osteoclasts [<xref rid="pone.0196504.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is possible that tailored additional control systems exist to meet the needs of particular cell types. In this regard, it is noteworthy that T and B cells undergo transitions between actively proliferating states and survival for long periods in a quiescent state, which causes large associated metabolic changes. Similarly, the cells also have to deal with huge variations in oxygen concentrations between blood, spleen and lymph nodes and within secondary lymph nodes themselves and need tight control of mitochondrial load/activity. As the process of autophagy/mitophagy is a key regulator of catabolism and mitochondrial function, higher-level controls of the system may have evolved under the pressure of such huge changes in demand. We would speculate that GIMAP6 is a key component of this higher-level control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained in the Babraham Institute Biological Support Unit under Specific Opportunistic Pathogen Free (SOPF) conditions.
