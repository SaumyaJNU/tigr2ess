    "Although supracondylar fractures of the humerus are common in children, open fractures of are extremely rare injuries. Gustilo- Anderson Type-III fractures in the upper extremity are primarily associated with considerable bone loss resulting from high energy trauma. In this study, a case of open pediatric supracondylar humerus fracture treated by a joint and defect spanning multiplanar tubular external fixation is presented.A boy aged 3 years suffered from a Gustilo-Anderson Type-IIIA supracondylar humerus fractures. There was no neurovascular compromise. Intravenous antibiotic regimen was introduced. A joint and defect spanning multiplanar tubular external fixation was employed within 4 h of the accident. After the operation, the patient was closely followed in the inpatients unit. The external fixator was removed in the 6th week of follow-up, and range of motion exercises was started. With the exception of limited flexion of the elbow in 12th month of follow-up, supination and pronation were full. At the 48th month follow-up, 120° of elbow flexion, full extension, and full forearm rotation were observed. Physical examination showed 15° change in carrying angle to cubitus varus; radiologic examination showed a slight varus angulation of the distal humerus, a decreased Baumann's angle. The Mayo elbow performance score was 100 points.When taking into account the high remodeling capacity, healing potential, and greater resistance to joint stiffness in fractures of children, joint and external fixators appear as a viable definitive treatment in such cases."
