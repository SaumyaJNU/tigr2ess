Previous ethnobotanical studies in Gujarat have exclusively focused on economically important species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], or ethnomedicinal uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], so clear knowledge gap exists for the listing and habitat usage with respect to wild edibles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par14">Located in the western part of the country, the state of Gujarat is home to 29 Scheduled Tribes that together account for 14.8% of the state population. The Vasavas are one such tribe that have inhabited the Shoolpaneshwar forest belt, one of the dense forest belts within the state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The medicine men &#x0201c;Bhagats&#x0201d; of Vasava tribe are known for their indigenous plant knowledge to treat illnesses of their community, part of which has recently been recorded from the pharmaceutical perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The Vasavas are often described as subsistence farmers who possess traditional knowledge about plants due to close proximity to the forests. Nonetheless, rapid economic growth is inducing outmigration and transformation of land usage in the region, thereby threatening the survival of traditional knowledge as well as free access to forests for this tribe. Even though tribal areas in India often receive intervention programs for nutrition and livelihood enhancement, such programs have never been implemented in the study area, locally known as Dediapada Taluka.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Dediapada Taluka with study sites</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13002_2018_254_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par15">The Shoolpaneshwar forest belt spans an area of 608&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> over two Talukas, Dediapada and Sagbara, and is considered one of the rich biodiversity zones of the state (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The Narmada district, the administrative unit above them, has a forest cover of 41.5% across an area characterized by hilly terrain and a semi-arid climate. The district&#x02019;s average annual rainfall is ~&#x02009;700&#x000a0;mm, with 31 recorded rainy days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There are two agricultural seasons, the rainy season (Kharif) from July to October and the post-rainy season (Rabi) from November to March. While all farmers cultivate during Kharif, only those with irrigation facilities plant a second crop during Rabi.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Minimum, maximum, and average temperatures and rainfall at Dediapada Taluka</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13002_2018_254_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">According to the 2011 district census data for Narmada, 85% of the total population are involved in agricultural production. At the same time, 65% of the total population earn their income as agricultural or industrial laborers, primarily because of small landholding, a phenomenon originating from land fragmentation through inheritance. The majority of the population lie below the poverty line and the literacy rate is low; in Dediapada Taluka, it is 65%. Combined together, these factors force many Vasavas to out-migrate for alternative sources of livelihood, moving them away from their original ecological zone. As their &#x0201c;wisdom&#x0201d; concerning wild plants has typically been passed on from parents to children, limited access to forests by family members is thought to be threatening knowledge transfer.</p><p id="Par17">According to the information collected during fieldwork, the staple source of carbohydrates for the Vasavas is rice while in hilly regions where paddy farming is difficult, it is maize. Other cereals such as sorghum, as well as indigenous millet such as bunti (<italic>Echinocloa crus-galli</italic> (L.) P.Beauv.), muu (<italic>Panicum pilosum</italic> Sw), kodri (<italic>Paspalum scrobiculatum</italic> L.), and bajro (<italic>Pennisetum typhoides</italic> (Burm.f.) Stapf &#x00026; C.E.Hubb.), are also consumed, along with cultivated vegetables (both heirloom and commercial varieties) grown in both agricultural fields and home gardens. Wild edibles form a major part of their complementary diet; for example, as much as 40% of the food consumed by the Bhil tribe, who live nearby, was sourced from non-agricultural fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], typically collected from nearby forests or their surroundings. For the Vasavas, a typical meal consists of a staple (rice, maize, sorghum, or millet) with vegetables and/or wild edibles, the latter of which are boiled, saut&#x000e9;ed, or added to <italic>daal</italic> (a runny soup made with pulses). Meat, poultry, and fish can also be part of the Vasavas&#x02019; diet depending on the family&#x02019;s economic reach and availability, while dairy products are severely limited due to the lack of storage facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par18">In order to achieve the aforementioned aim of the research, local data were collected under three approaches: key informant interviews to record the Vasavas&#x02019; knowledge of wild edibles and methods of plant collection, village group interviews to quantify past and current consumption trends, and expert interviews to elucidate reasons for the decreased consumption of wild edibles.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Key informant interviews</title><p id="Par19">Twenty-five key informants from 12 different villages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were purposefully selected. Altogether, 14 men and 11 women were interviewed. Their ages ranged from 26 to 87 (mean 51.8, median 49). The studied settlements represent all the major ecological features of Dediapada Taluka. These key informants consisted of tribal healers and the local elders, who were considered the most knowledgeable about local plants within each village. Care was taken to include both genders from each village as, generally speaking, more men collect wild plants from forests, while more women are responsible for collecting and cooking plants from the village surroundings (e.g., home gardens) on a regular basis.</p><p id="Par20">The interviews were conducted during the periods of August&#x02013;September 2016 and December 2016&#x02013;February 2017. The Gujarati language (the regional language) was used with occasional translation to the Vasavi language (the local tribal language). Each interview started with a field visit with the interviewee, which covered nearby forests, agricultural fields, and swamp habitats where edible plants were growing at the time of the survey. Information on the plant part used, typical recipes for cooking, potential for medicinal use, and the season, and primary locations of collection were noted. Each species was identified and photographically recorded in the field. Voucher specimens were also collected for species not already covered by previous floristic surveys carried out in the region. Following the field visit, each informant was interviewed again, inside their house, where the local names for the plants were confirmed and matched against photographs and dried specimens of the species, under the supervision of an experienced local taxonomist. The dried herbarium specimens of the species are identified by a taxonomist and stored at the herbarium of The Serenity Library &#x00026; Botanical Garden (for details, refer to &#x0201c;Availability of data and materials&#x0201d;).At the conclusion of all interviews, a comprehensive list of wild edibles utilized by the Vasavas was compiled. This list was subsequently used to analyze habitat distribution and seasonal consumption patterns, as described below in the &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Data analysis</xref>&#x0201d; section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Village group discussions</title><p id="Par21">Village heads, local school officials, and long-term residents from 12 villages (96 respondents) were invited to group discussions, held in August&#x02013;September 2016, about the past and current trends surrounding the consumption of wild edibles. These open-ended interviews were carried out at either village schools or the homes of village heads/key informants. When the snowball technique was employed to maximize the amount of information collected, care was taken to include participants of various age groups from both genders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Expert interviews</title><p id="Par22">Structured questionnaire surveys were conducted with seven experts from different villages (Bondiservan, Vadhwa, Khudadi, Khokhraumar, Zadoli, Khairdipada, and Jamni villages), who were selected based on the recommendation of village heads during the group discussions. The questionnaire was based on the input obtained from the village group discussions and designed as a multi-purpose survey. The results presented in this paper primarily focus on the reasons for changing consumption patterns of wild edibles, obtained by means of pairwise comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], encompassing six alternatives.

Here, a village habitat was defined as an environment that was fully or partially anthropologically managed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c). A forest habitat was defined as an area minimally managed by humans (although they are often close to villages), and a swamp habitat as a location where water bodies were present for most of the year, for example puddles, small riverines, and ponds. This grouping was based on the most common habitats from which each species was collected and therefore does not imply non-presence of the species in other locations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Representative habitats for wild edibles: <bold>a</bold> village habitat, <bold>b</bold> forest habitat, and <bold>c</bold> swamp habitat</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13002_2018_254_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">The parts of the plants utilized were also categorized into six groups (leaves, flowers, seeds/fruits, underground parts, young shoots, multiple parts). The fourth group (underground parts) represents all storage organs including tubers, bulbs, corms, and rhizomes. The last group (multiple parts) covers species that are primarily collected for non-edible purposes but of which organs (same or different) are also used as human food.</p><p id="Par25">Local names for plants in the compiled species list were transcribed into English with phonetic intuition, as the Vasavi language does not have a written script. Typical months of collection and typical methods of cooking were also recorded in this list, so as to obtain insight into the Vasavas&#x02019; culinary outlook and nutritional status.</p><p id="Par26">A complete plant list was compiled with their Vasavi names, scientific names, plant parts utilized, primary habitats, and cooking methods.

This value was used as an indicator for the seasonal availability of the plants and for the locations of actual collection events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Since the primary focus of the present study was on usage patterns of habitats for sourcing these species, the number of species was judged to offer better insights than the level of biomass available, a common indicator for sustainable harvesting. The number of species collected for each plant part was also collated to evaluate the potential of wild edibles to provide diverse pathways of nutrient acquisition. The information collected from the village group discussions and the expert interviews was utilized to support interpretation of the quantitative findings.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Results</title><p id="Par28">Through the key informant interviews, 90 species of wild edibles were identified (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

When asked whether consumption and utilization of wild edibles had increased, decreased, or remained unchanged since as distant a past as they could remember, all respondents unanimously stated that their consumption had decreased, a response subsequently repeated in the expert interviews as well. Participants in group discussions highlighted several reasons for this change, for example the inability of children to identify species and participate in their collection, and their preference for cultivated vegetables. Comments were also made that the availability of certain species had decreased in their respective habitats, and thus, villagers would need to travel further into the forest to collect a sufficient amount.</p><p id="Par39">These answers were then used to design a section of the questionnaire for the expert interviews, in which they were asked to rank pairwise the predefined reasons for decreased consumption of wild edibles. The most common reason, ranked on the total score of 7 respondents, was decreased availability, followed by a change in food preferences and the lack of the knowledge needed to identify species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The respondents also indicated that there was an increasing preference for cultivated edibles amongst the younger generation, who have insufficient time to go out and collect wild edibles, due to their work and household commitments. The lowest ranked reason was a reduced requirement for a safety net for times of need, such as famines and financial shortfalls.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Pairwise ranking for the cause of decreased consumption of wild edibles</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reasons for decreased consumption of edible wilds</th><th>V1</th><th>V2</th><th>V3</th><th>V4</th><th>V5</th><th>V6</th><th>V7</th><th>Total score</th><th>Rank</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Decreased availability in wild</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>23</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Change in food preference</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>19</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of knowledge of identifying edible vegetables</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>18</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>More preference to cultivated vegetables</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>17</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>No time to collect</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Less desperate need or famine situation</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>Abbreviation</italic> village: <italic>V1</italic> Bondiservan, <italic>V2</italic> Vadhwa, <italic>V3</italic> Khudardi, <italic>V4</italic> Khokhraumar, <italic>V5</italic> Zadoli, <italic>V6</italic> Khairdipada, <italic>V7</italic> Jamni</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>All-year sustenance from wild edibles</title><p id="Par40">In this research, 90 species of wild edibles from 46 botanical families were identified as used by the Vasavas in Dediapada Taluka.

In most of the papers dealing with wild foods, the times of gathering are usually mentioned as the &#x0201c;rainy season&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] spring and early summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] or spring and autumn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Anthropogenically managed habitats for wild edible collection</title><p id="Par44">Anthropogenically managed habitats (e.g., villages, 37 spp.) were preferred to unmanaged habitats (e.g., forests, 20 spp.) for the collection of wild edibles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This result is counter-intuitive given the term &#x0201c;wild,&#x0201d; which is more generally associated with unmanaged environments. A similar observation was made by Cruz-Garcia and Price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and Misra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], in whose research man-made agro-ecosystems were found to be an important source of wild edibles. Combined with the number of species collected from both forest and village habitats (20), a total of 57 species were collected from anthropogenically managed habitats; this suggests that conservation efforts for wild edibles should be extended beyond natural forests, as human-inhabited areas also constitute important habitats for the community. Their occurrence is intertwined with traditional crop cultivation, forming agro-ecosystems providing both cultivated and wild economic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">While tree species from forests were collected all year round, their collection from villages was largely limited to the first half of the year, when only households with irrigation facilities can cultivate crops (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These tree species, therefore, are thought to be a vital, and possibly the only, source of micronutrients for a large proportion of the Vasavas, especially during the hot and dry summer.</p><p id="Par46">Swamps were shown to be important habitats for leafy vegetables throughout the year (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). While a large number of species were sourced from these habitats during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, their availability in villages and forests was negligible during summer. Hence, the maintenance of swamps and water bodies is likely to be crucial for the year-round inclusion of wild leafy vegetables in the diet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The role of wild edibles in dietary diversity</title><p id="Par47">Boedecker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed that the consumption of wild edibles was significantly related to an increased level of dietary diversity, which, in turn, has been associated with nutritional quality and therefore is a useful indicator for food security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. It is thus likely that the consumption of wild edibles would improve the nutritional status of the tribal population, who have limited access to anthropogenically produced plants. In the present case, the largest number of species belonged to fruits category, followed by leafy vegetables (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This finding suggests that the Vasavas enjoy a diverse supply of micronutrients, as many of them are abundant in plants that come under these two categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">A FAO case study carried out in Gujarat reported that, for the Bhil tribe, wild foods contributed 30% of total energy intake for children and 24% for pregnant women. Furthermore, 41% (39 of 95 items) of their foods were collected from uncultivated sources, showing a high dependence on wild edibles for both energy and micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. While a detailed nutritional investigation is beyond the remit of the present study, the above results indicated that the Vasavas are highly dependent on wild edibles as well, especially for micronutrients from fruits and leafy vegetables.</p><p id="Par49">Wild leafy vegetables are an important source of carotenoids, including vitamin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Provided the leaves are consumed with fats, they can provide a year-round supply of vitamin A, as is the case of this tribe, where it is noted that they consume leafy vegetables that are stir-fried in vegetable oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Healthcare implications</title><p id="Par50">A comparative analysis between the present data and a previous ethnobotanical investigation focusing on medicinal plant usage (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) revealed that 67% of edible species could also be used for medicinal purposes. This shows a great overlap of the food and healthcare functions of wild plants, as has been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Although it is difficult to quantify the health impact associated with the regular consumption of medicinal wild edibles, their inclusion in the daily diet at least ensures the maintenance of traditional medicinal knowledge through continued usage. The level of traditional medical knowledge has been rapidly declining in various parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]; in the case of India, where medical pluralism is a long-standing cultural phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], wild plants offer an important alternative to modern allopathic healthcare options, which are expensive and less accessible in many rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">A study of the adolescent tribal population from nine states in India, including Gujarat, reported that amongst tribal people, deficiency in micronutrients, such as vitamin A, iron, free folic acid, and riboflavin, was more severe than that in energy and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The same trend was also observed on the study site by a local allopathic doctor, who attested that vitamin B and iron deficiency (including genetic sickle cell anemia) were extremely common in the region. Given that leafy vegetables are widely recognized as a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin B complex, and iron and that cultivated greens as well as meat and dairy products are limited in the local market, wild leafy vegetables are a crucial source of these micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A similar argument also holds for wild fruits, which are considered to be a good source of micronutrients and fibers, as nutritional studies of indigenous food from Jharkhand, India, indicate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Considering the relatively low cost associated with the acquisition of wild edibles compared to foods of equal nutritional value available on the commercial market, encouraging their continued consumption is likely to be a reasonable choice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Decreased consumption</title><p id="Par52">It was found that the primary reasons for decreased consumption of wild edibles were their decreased availability, changes in food preferences, and a lack of the knowledge needed to identify edible species (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The second and third reasons are somewhat interrelated, as changes in food preferences over a prolonged period of time may have exacerbated the lack of knowledge of species which are no longer familiar. Similar situations have been reported in the literature, where formal schooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and lack of access to forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] led to a decline in traditional ecological knowledge and individual knowledge of medicinal plants.</p><p id="Par53">The primary reason behind the preference for cultivated vegetables is thought to be a gradual shift in diet. For example, young children attending a school outside their village become acquainted with wheat and cultivated vegetables and at the same time have fewer opportunities to visit forests with those who can share their knowledge of edible (and medicinal) plants. This trend may potentially be reversed by, amongst other methods, maintaining children&#x02019;s contacts with wild edibles when they return home for holidays and modifying the education curriculum to cover more knowledge from within the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Unlike other studies reporting &#x0201c;stigma&#x0201d; against wild edibles amongst tribal people in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], such a perception was not observed during the present study. The results from the expert interviews indicate that the Vasavas do not generally collect wild edibles as an economic safety net, the leading mechanism to produce &#x0201c;stigma&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]; instead, the most cited reason for the decreased consumption of wild edibles was simply decreased availability. It is interesting to note that, while most families in the study region are still engaging in collection, most respondents at both the village group discussions and the expert interviews expressed the view that the overall consumption had significantly decreased. A similar finding was also reported from the Nanda Devi biosphere reserve in India by Misra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This phenomenon warrants further analysis, possibly through quantitative evaluation of biomass availability across habitats and seasons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Promotion of wild edibles</title><p id="Par55">Reyes-Garcia et al. reported that association of &#x0201c;cultural ecosystem services and values&#x0201d; explains the change in consumption patterns of wild edibles and that there had been a revival of certain wild species that were associated with &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In other words, gastronomic culture could help maintain the consumption of certain wild edible plants. This is an important point to consider at the designing stage of intervention programs for conservation of traditional knowledge or dietary diversity. Associating cultural identity with wild edibles will likely maintain the familiarity of these plants and, by extension, promote their usage amongst younger generations. Examples of these efforts include community-based activities, such as recipe competitions and food tasting at village fairs, or workshops at schools and social gatherings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">The present study has demonstrated that the Vasava tribe&#x02019;s collective knowledge of wild edibles is vast and, more importantly, significantly contributes to dietary diversity throughout the year. The finding of the present study, namely that anthropologically managed habitats were preferred over natural environments for the collection of wild edibles, suggests that conservation efforts should be extended to village landscapes in addition to human-uninhabited landscapes. Of a wide range of wild edibles, tree species are likely playing an especially important role in the acquisition of micronutrients, as they can provide sustenance throughout the dry period. While there is no doubt that inclusion of these species in future development planning is important, pathways to ensure the spontaneous consumption of wild edibles need to be further developed at the same time. Continued consumption will likely maintain knowledge within the community and, through a spillover effect, along with the medicinal and industrial values attached to the species.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>FAO</term><def><p id="Par5">Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSFDC</term><def><p id="Par6">Gujarat State Forest Development Corporation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NWFP</term><def><p id="Par7">Non-wood forest products</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WEP</term><def><p id="Par8">Wild edible plants</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to extend our deep gratitude to Mr. Francis Mcwan, Mr. Himmat Chauhan, and Fr.
