The transcriptome data for finger millet is available at NCBI. It is of
interest to annotate and characterize starch synthase enzyme from finger millet transcriptome data. Starch synthase plays an important
role in the elongation of glucan chains during the formation of starch. The starch synthase enzyme is characterized using three
domains (Glyco_transf_5, Glycos_transf_1 and Glyco_trans_1_4). Binding sites for GLC (alpha-d-glucose), PLP (Pyridoxal-5'-
phosphate), AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) and GOL (Glycerol) are found. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the finger millet
starch synthase is similar to the granule-bound starch synthase of Oryza sativa and Concrete amaricanus. We report the sequence
(GenBank accession number KY648917) and the structural model of finger millet starch synthase (PMDB ID: PM0081600).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Finger millet</kwd><kwd>CDS</kwd><kwd>SBE</kwd><kwd>Domain</kwd><kwd>PMDB</kwd><kwd>NCBI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Starch is the important molecule for plant development and
reproduction. Starch can define as a complex branched glucose
polymer and the branch molecular weight distribution power up
the nutritionally important properties such as digestion rate, etc
[<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Resistant starch is considered the third type of dietary fiber,
as it can deliver some of the benefits of insoluble fiber and some
of the benefits of soluble fiber. Some carbohydrates such as sugar
and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose
into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used
for short-term energy needs for stored. Resistant starch, on the
other hand, resists digestion and passes through the large
intestine where it acts like dietary fibers. The resistance from
digestion is attributed by the ratio of amylase and amylopectin
chain during starch biosynthesis besides architectural effects
during packaging of grains. Starch is the end product of
photosynthesis in source tissues and is stored as energy reserves
in sink tissues. Starch has two major components, the basically
linear a-polyglucan amylose, and the branched a-polyglucan
amylopectin. The a-1, 4-glucosidic link chains of both amylose
and amylopectin are elongated by the addition of the glucose
moiety from ADP glucose, which is synthesized by ADP glucose
pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) from glucose-1-P, to the nonreducing
end of the a-glucan acceptor molecule. The elongation
reactions for the a-1, 4-chains of amylose and amylopectin are
distinctively catalyzed using a starch granule-bound form of
starch synthase (GBSS) and a soluble form of starch synthase (SS),
respectively. Starch synthase activity was first discovered using
Leloir's group and the activity were associated with the starch
granule. These starch synthases are designated as GBSSs to
distinguish them from the starch synthases mainly in the soluble
phase of the chloroplast or amyloplast. The starch-synthase
enzyme is one of the four major enzyme classes involved in
starch biosynthesis in plants as SSI, SSII, SSIII, and SSIV.</p><p>A cereal is a grass, a member of the monocot family Poaceae also
known as Gramineae, which usually have long, thin stalks, such
as wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley, and rye, whose
starchy grains are used as food. The term cereal is not limited to
these grains. But, refers to foodstuff prepared from the starchy
grains of cereal like flours, breads and pasta [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. All cereals are
annual plants and consequently, one planting yields one harvest.
The demands on climate, however, are different. Warm-season
cereals (corn, rice, sorghum, millet) are grown in tropical
lowlands throughout the year and in temperate climates during
the frost-free season. Finger millet is considered to be a boon for
diabetes patients and obese people, as the digestion of finger
Millet takes place at a slow pace and hence, glucose is released
slowly into the blood [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In rice and other related plants the
sequence of starch synthase enzyme is known but in finger millet,
the nucleotide sequence of the starch synthase enzyme is not yet
known. Availability of the transcriptome data of developing
spikes of finger millet [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] provides an opportunity to predict the
gene sequence of important traits of the nutritional point of view.
Hence an effort is made for the prediction of an important
enzyme i.e. starch synthase enzyme in the finger millet and
submit the genomic as well as proteomic information for further
scientific and research interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence retrieval and Domain prediction</title><p>The sequence of finger millet starch synthase enzyme was
retrieved by the blast analysis of the homologous sequence of rice
download from NCBI database. Local BLAST [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] was used to
retrieve starch synthase sequence of finger millet from the online
submitted [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] transcriptome data of finger millets. ORF
Prediction tool was used for open reading frame prediction with
default parameters and verify predicted protein using newly
developed SMART BLAST or regular BLASTP. ORF finder
searches for open reading frames (ORFs) in the nucleotide
sequence (KY648917). The program returns the range of each
ORF, along with its protein translation. SMART domain
prediction tool was used for the prediction of the domain in the
coding sequence of starch synthase finger millet.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Protein Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Structure and
Function Prediction</title><p>Protein sequence level annotation was done using ProtParam
server. It allows the computation of various physical and
chemical parameters for protein sequence (ARA71548). The
computed parameters include the molecular weight, theoretical
pI, amino acid composition, atomic composition, instability
index, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropath city
(GRAVY) [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The secondary structure of protein sequence (ARA71548) was
predicted by CFSSP (Chou &#x00026; Fasman Secondary Structure
Prediction Server) is an online protein secondary structure
prediction server. This server predicts regions of secondary
structure from the protein sequence such as alpha helix, beta
sheet, and turns from the amino acid sequence. The output of the 
predicted secondary structure is also displayed in linear
sequential graphical view based on the probability of occurrence
of alpha helix, beta sheet, and turns with implemented CFSSP is
Chou-Fasman algorithm, which is based on analyses of the
relative frequencies of each amino acid in alpha helices, beta
sheets, and turns based on known protein structures solved with
X-ray crystallography [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The tertiary structure of the starch synthase enzyme (ARA71548)
was predicted using RaptorX a web portal for protein structure
and function prediction. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme
was submitted to the server and which predicts its tertiary
structures as well as contact map, solvent accessibility,
disordered regions and binding sites and assigned confidence
scores to indicate the quality of prediction results. For structure
validation purpose Ramachandran plot analysis was done using
RamPage server [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Template validation and Phylogenetic Analysis</title><p>For validating the template-based modeling by RaptorX server,
we have done Blastp against PDB database and select the
template protein sequences. These Protein sequences were
subjected to multiple sequence alignment and tree construction
using MEGA v6.0 [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We construct another phylogenetic tree of
starch synthase nucleotide sequence on the basis of protein
sequence similarity by using NCBI blastp non-redundant protein
database and retrieved all the similar sequences for phylogenetic
analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Result &#x00026; Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>ORD and Domain Prediction</title><p>Nucleotide as well as protein sequences of starch synthase of
Eleusine coracana were retrieved by NCBI database, which were
submitted in NCBI with nucleotide sequence accession KY648917
length is 1851 base pare and protein sequence ARA71548 is
comprises 616 amino acids. The open reading frame analysis of
the nucleotide sequence resulted in 20 ORF, on positive and
negative strands and selected the longest ORF among them with
616 amino acid long and cover a total length of the Nucleotide
sequence.</p><p>SMART Domain prediction tool predict the three major domains
in the protein sequence of starch synthase enzyme viz- low
complexity domain (51-75), Glyco_transf_5 (90-351) with and
Glycos_transf_1 (396-531) as shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. This family is
most closely related to the GT1 family of glycosyltransferases.
Glycogen synthase catalyzes the formation and elongation of the
alpha-1,4-glucose backbone using ADP-glucose, the second and
key step of glycogen biosynthesis. This family includes starch
synthases of plants, such as DULL1 in Zea mays and glycogen
synthases of various organisms.</p><p>Superfamily glycosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of sugar
moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor
molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. The acceptor molecule can
be a protein, a heterocyclic compound, a lipid or another 
carbohydrate residue. The structures of the formed
glycoconjugates are extremely diverse, involved in a wide range
of biological functions. The members of this family share a
common GTB topology, one of the two protein topologies
observed for nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases.
GTB proteins have distinct N and C- terminal domains each
containing a typical Rossmann fold. The two domains have high
structural homology despite minimal sequence homology. The
large cleft that separates the two domains includes the catalytic
center and permits a high degree of flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Protein Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Structure Prediction</title><p>A number of amino acids in the starch synthase are 616 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
and the molecular weight was found 67201.01 with theoretical pI
6.87. The total number of negatively charged residues (Asp +
Glu) and the total number of positively charged residues (Arg +
Lys) were 72 and 71 respectively. The chemical formula of the
enzyme is "C2987H4700N830O875S30" with 9422 number of
atoms. The aliphatic index was found 81.59 and grand average of
hydropathicity (GRAVY) was -0.200. The instability index (II) is
computed to be 27.50 which classify the protein as stable. An
intermediate but useful step is to predict the protein secondary
structure, that is, each residue of a protein sequence is assigned a
conformational state, either helix (H), sheet (E) or coil (C) and the
secondary structure of starch synthase has 71.3% helix, 60.2%
sheet and 11.9 % coil region.</p><p>Tertiary structure of starch synthase was predicted by using
3vueA template with p-value 9.74e-12 and Overall uGDT (GDT)
is 448 (72) and 616(100%) residues are modeled. Solvent access is
22%E, 44%M, 32%B <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The Ramachandran plot analysis of
the predicted structure shows that the percentage of residues in
favoured region is 95.0%, residues in allowed region 4.2% and
residues in outlier region was 0.8%, which indicate that the
structure has a stable and accurate prediction. The binding
affinity of ligands i.e. Alpha-d-glucose, Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate
Adenosine monophosphate and Glycerol with the starch
synthase tertiary structure was calculated by RaptorX server
<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> &#x00026; <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The predicted model of starch synthase of finger
millet in the 3D conformation was submitted to protein model
submission database with the PMDB ID - PM0081600 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>For prediction of protein tertiary structure, there is need of
template so Blastp program was used against PDB database and
use all the hits for the phylogenetic study and 3VUE of rice was
found much closer with starch synthase of Eleusine coracana as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis was done on the basis of protein sequence
and protein structure. The sequence level analysis was done on
the basis of blastp result and top 25-blast hit were retrieved and
used these sequences for phylogenetic analysis by aligning them 
together. By this analysis, it was found that the starch synthase
sequence of Eleusine coracana was much similar to the granulebound
starch synthase of Oryza sativa and Concrete amaricanus as
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Finger millet is a nutritionally rich cereal crop grown in different
regions of worlds under adverse weather conditions. It is rich in
calcium among other cereal crops. The transcriptome data of
finger millet is also available. Different pathways are involved in
the starch biosynthesis catalyzed by different enzymes. Starch is
synthesized in plastids, including chloroplasts in photosynthetic
tissues and amyloplasts in non-photosynthetic tissues such as
seeds, roots, and tubers. Starch synthesized in chloroplasts of
photosynthetic tissues is degraded to hexoses during the dark
period. It is of interest to characterize starch synthase enzyme
from finger millet. We report its sequence and structural model
with predicted functional and architectural features.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Edited by P Kangueane</bold></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Citation: </bold>Tyagi <italic>et al.</italic> Bioinformation 14(7): 393-397 (2018)</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>PLOS ONE.</source><year>2015</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>e0125507.</fpage><?supplied-pmid 25874689?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25874689</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sarwar</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>Journal of cereals and oilseeds.</source><year>2013</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>32</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R03"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Begum</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>International Journal of Science, Environment and Technology.</source><year>2016</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>4086</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="R04"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname></name><etal/></person-group><source>Plant molecular biology reporter.</source><year>2014</year><volume>33</volume></element-citation></ref><ref id="R05"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Altschul</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><source>J.
