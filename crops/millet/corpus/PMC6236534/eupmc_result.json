    "Background:Production of foods safe for consumption is an important issue worldwide. Organochlorine pesticides (OCP) are often used to preserve crops. Their use can have serious impacts on human health. Objectives:This research aims at assessing OCP residues in food samples from markets in Lagos in southwestern Nigeria and their risk to human health. Methods:Sixteen food samples were collected from Lagos, Nigeria and analyzed for organochlorine pesticide residues. Extraction was performed using an ultrasonicator, and analysis was carried out using a gas chromatograph-electron capture detector. Risk assessment was carried out by determining the hazard quotient. Results:Results of the OCP residues found in the foods were generally low, with dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) having the highest residue concentration. The concentration of p,p'-DDE was as high as 110 ng/g in pulses and 123 ng/g in Cameroon and chili peppers. The risk index was <1 in most cases, with the exception of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDD) in fruits for children. Discussion:The results were generally lower than what has been documented in other parts of the world and suggest that consumption of the foods investigated in the present study in Nigeria may be considered safe for the 13 OCPs investigated. Conclusions:There is a need for continuous monitoring of these OCPs and investigation of carbamate and phosphate pesticide residues since they are more widely used in farming practices in Nigeria."
