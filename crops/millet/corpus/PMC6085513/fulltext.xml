There is evidence that encouraging increased access to and consumption of these ASFs may either positively or negatively impact anemia, or have no nutritional effects. Drawing upon first-hand experiences in Ghana, this study sought to: (1) identify the main motivations for raising livestock in Ghana; (2) describe the major barriers to consuming ASFs, especially among women of reproductive age (WRA); and (3) explore the feasibility of different livestock-centered interventions to reduce anemia. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were held with relevant stakeholders at different geographical scales - the national, regional, district, and community levels. The results suggest that livestock enable savings, allow resource-poor households to accumulate assets, and help finance planned and unplanned expenditures (e.g., school fees and illness). Due to these multiple and often pressing uses, direct consumption of home-reared ASFs is not a major priority, especially for poor households. Even when ASFs are consumed, intra-household allocation does not favor women and adolescent girls, demographic groups with particularly high micronutrient requirements. The study participants discussed possible interventions to address these challenges, including (1) increasing livestock ownership through in-kind credit; (2) encouraging nutrition-related behavior change; (3) improving livestock housing; and (4) hatchery management. The paper discusses these interventions based upon potential acceptance, feasibility, cost effectiveness, and sustainability in the Ghanaian context.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Animal-Source Foods (ASFs) are excellent sources of micronutrients.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">This study identifies the main motivations for raising livestock in Ghana.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">The report also describes barriers to consuming ASFs, especially among women.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Results suggest diverse, non-nutritional reasons for raising livestock.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">The analysis highlights possible interventions to increase ASF consumption.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Animal-source foods</kwd><kwd>Anemia</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Livestock production and management</kwd><kwd>Infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>Ghana</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Anemia is among the most common global nutritional disorders and public health concerns. Two billion people worldwide are anemic, and disproportionately so in women of reproductive age (WRA) and young children (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). Global anemia prevalence is 38% in pregnant women (32.4 million) and 29% in non-pregnant women (496 million) (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2013</xref>), with marked variation among regions. Indeed, nowhere is anemia prevalence higher than in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The World Health Organization estimates that 38% and 46% of non-pregnant and pregnant WRA, respectively, are anemic in SSA (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). Especially for WRA, anemia is of grave concern since it contributes to adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight, stillbirth, preterm birth, and increased child and maternal mortality (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Galloway et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Many factors underlie anemia risk, including parasitic infections, inherited blood disorders, numerous vitamin deficiencies (e.g., folic acid, vitamins B12 and A) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Balarajan et al., 2011</xref>), and acute or chronic immune activation (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Weiss and Goodnough, 2005</xref>). However, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). Iron-deficiency anemia interventions have centered primarily on nutrition-specific approaches (e.g., dietary or micronutrient supplementation (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Galloway et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Vieira et al., 2017</xref>)), targeting the most proximate determinants of the problem (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhutta et al., 2013</xref>). Much attention has also been given to fortification of cereals and other food crops, for example, production of iron-rich beans and pearl millet (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Haas et al., 2013</xref>). Despite evidence of benefits, several factors have hindered the effectiveness of these interventions including supply chain challenges, and the difficulty of reaching target populations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bhutta et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Nutrition-sensitive interventions, in contrast, focus on the underlying determinants of nutrition, including poverty, household food insecurity, and unhealthy living environments (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Ruel et al., 2013</xref>). Such interventions have in part included the promotion of increased consumption of fruits and vegetables through homestead gardens (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Helen Keller International, 1993</xref>). There is evidence, however, that livestock-based interventions may effectively complement such interventions focused on plant-source foods by promoting consumption of animal-source foods (ASFs) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berti and Cossio, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Leroy and Frongillo, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2003</xref>). Case studies increasingly suggest that greater consumption of ASFs may sustainably diversify and improve diet quality, nutritional status, and overall health (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Osei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rawlins et al., 2014</xref>). Iron intake could be enhanced by increasing the availability and consumption of home-produced ASF (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Allen, 2003</xref>). ASFs such as beef, fish, and poultry are rich sources of bioavailable heme iron, which is more easily absorbed than the iron contained in plants (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Allen, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Also, the selling of self-produced animals or animal products can increase household income that then could be used to purchase micronutrient-rich foods (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Despite the nutritional benefits of ASFs, livestock production may also negatively influence anemia risk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). First, not all ASFs are rich in iron. Cow milk, for example, contains little iron, and can actually enhance iron-deficiency among infants and toddlers through intestinal bleeding and competition of calcium with iron (<xref rid="bib1a" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler, 2011</xref>). Second, because women and girls commonly bear animal husbandry responsibilities, increased livestock production may decrease the amount and quality of time available for child care and feeding activities (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Njuki et al., 2016</xref>). Third, keeping livestock could also increase risk of clinical and sub-clinical infection, either through contact with feces, or contamination of food and water sources (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randolph et al., 2007</xref>). The close proximity of domestic livestock to humans has been associated with transmission of <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, causing acute bloody diarrhea (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>). This is particularly problematic for young children, among whom fecal-oral transmission may commonly occur during play (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Marquis et al., 1990</xref>). In sum, the multiple causal pathways involved make it difficult to accurately determine how livestock production may affect anemia risk in a given setting.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework of hypothesized causal linkages between animal agricultural production and capture, and anemia among adolescent girls and women of reproductive age.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0055">Accordingly, this study aimed to better understand the prospects and challenges of raising livestock to reduce anemia, while not increasing exposure to adverse health threats.

This case study was therefore designed to understand whether and how any of the casual linkages in the conceptual framework plays out across different regions of Ghana. As an open-ended qualitative study, however, we did not restrict data collection and analyses to only the casual linkages highlighted in the framework (e.g., food prices, food acquisition behaviors, gendered control over food, exposure to microbial pathogens, and infectious diseases. Although these casual linkages informed the design of data collection instruments and analysis, study participants were also allowed to talk about what is of greater concern to them. Indeed, the framework neither shows all moderating factors along the different pathways, nor is it meant to serve as a program theory framework for a proposed future intervention. Rather, it illustrates the broad impact pathways that we hypothesize will be relevant to understanding the potential for animal production and capture to affect anemia among WRA. The framework also demonstrates the complex network of factors that need to be considered in designing interventions aimed at reducing anemia among WRA.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Geographic setting</title><p id="p0080">This study was conducted in Ghana, which has among the highest anemia prevalence in the world (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2013</xref>) - 42% of Ghanaian women aged 15&#x02013;49 years, and 66% of children aged 6&#x02013;59 months are anemic (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service, 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) et al., 2015b</xref>).

Then, within each of the eight District, two communities were purposively selected to represent different characteristics using the following criteria: (1) availability of ASFs that are typical in that Region; (2) presence of livestock-rearing activities; and (3) physical accessibility to the community. We gained access to these 16 communities through District officials from the Ghana Health Service and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.</p><p id="p0100">During Phase Two, 33 KIIs were conducted with relevant regional and district stakeholders (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;9 in Central Region; <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10 in Northern Region; and <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;14 in Volta Region). As well, 48 FGDs (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;16 in each region) were held to assess areas of consensus and divergence among community members (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Using principles of maximum variation, we recruited FGD participants based on gender and age. Separate FGDs were held with men (aged &#x02265;20 years), adolescent girls (aged 15&#x02013;19 years), and adult women (aged 20&#x02013;49 years) in each of the 16 communities. This disaggregation was crucial, particularly in a context where women and adolescent girls tend to feel uneasy when discussing gender-sensitive issues in the presence of elderly men. To ensure consistency across the FGDs, we developed a focus-group guide based upon our research objectives, and emerging themes from the first phase of the fieldwork. Focus groups included 7&#x02013;11 participants, lasted &#x0223c;1&#x0202f;h, were audio recorded with permission, and were later transcribed for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Data analysis</title><p id="p0105">Qualitative data analysis followed the methods outlined by <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Patton (2014)</xref>. Hand-coding was used to ensure deep and continued immersion in the qualitative data. Firstly, a coding scheme was developed using our conceptual model. Secondly, codes or labels were assigned to segments of transcripts to help catalogue key concepts while preserving the context in which these concepts occur. After reaching theoretical saturation in the coding process (i.e., when no new concepts emerged from successive coding), we developed emerging themes. Themes represented patterned responses or meanings within the dataset (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2014</xref>). Key themes were identified according to criteria that included: (1) relevance to the research objectives; (2) frequency that the theme was mentioned; and (3) the predominance of the same theme across different types of participants (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Patton, 2014</xref>). An interdisciplinary team of five people was directly involved in the data analysis. Each person performed an independent coding using the coding scheme. Team discussions were then held daily to confer on how individual or disciplinary biases may have affected the codes generated. All inter-coder inconsistencies were resolved during these daily meetings. Midway through the analysis, a conference call was also organized among the entire study team in Ghana and the United States to further discuss and reach consensus on inter-coder inconsistencies. To ensure external validity of the coded themes, we organized a feedback workshop in Accra, Ghana, on 13 June 2017 to share preliminary results with stakeholders. Thirty-five people attended this &#x02018;member-checking&#x02019; workshop (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2014</xref>), 13 of whom had taken part in our KIIs, and 14 in our FGDs. The remaining 8 participants were scholars conducting similar research at the University of Ghana, University of Development Studies, and University of Cape Coast. The datasets were not lumped together at the member-checking workshop. Rather, we gave four different presentations at the workshop, two of which focused specifically on findings from the KIIs and FGDs. The findings from the KIIs and FGDs were fully validated by their respective participants.</p><p id="p0110">For this article, analysis was undertaken on 22 FGDs and 21 KIIs, which is a subset of the full dataset from the broader study (46 KIIs and 48 FGDs [<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]). In arriving at this sub-sample, several factors were taken into consideration, including conceptual and methodological best practices in qualitative research (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fusch and Ness, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Patton, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Sandelowski, 2008</xref>).

It is important to emphasize that the chosen sub-sample sufficiently represents each of the stakeholder groups interviewed, including respondents from the national, regional, and community levels. Gender and age differences are also adequately represented. Moreover, from a qualitative research standpoint, a sub-sample that includes an experienced group of 21 key informants, as well as 203 diverse FGD participants, is considered adequate for exploratory studies (e.g., see <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fusch and Ness, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Miles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Patton, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample population characteristics</title><p id="p0115">Selected characteristics of the study population showed broad variations across age, gender, region of residence, and stakeholder expertise (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Moreover, home consumption of sheep and goat was said to be rare, and the consumption of home-grown cattle was never mentioned in any interview. Consumption of small and large ruminants typically occurred if the animal became sick or died. Repeatedly, participants said that livestock-rearing households would not normally consume a healthy animal, often citing the need for income as the main reason:<disp-quote><p>The farmers want money, so they would not want to consume the livestock.

For some households, livestock are used for ploughing, and manure production for soil fertility management. For others, livestock have ceremonial or symbolic uses, including marriage contracts (e.g. bride wealth). Livestock manure also reportedly had other uses, including serving as a mosquito repellent from cow dung that is mixed with water and smeared around homesteads.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.2"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Theme 2: Major barriers shaping access to and consumption of ASFs</title><p id="p0150">Participants also discussed major barriers and disincentives that limit ASF consumption.

Some respondents revealed that ASF consumption may be low because there is a lack information on the nutritional benefits of these foods:<disp-quote><p>As I said earlier, there may be certain animal products that are good for people like pregnant women. But most people don't know these nutritional benefits. That's why they don't consume a lot of meat. If I'm consuming goat meat and chicken, I'm not thinking about the nutrients from these foods.

Many participants felt that ASFs are extremely expensive, particularly for poor households. Similarly, others remarked that availability of ASFs is not a key challenge, as meat, milk, and eggs are abundant in markets. However, their costs are highly prohibitive:<disp-quote><p>On a scale right now, people are not drinking milk, eating eggs or eating enough meat. Not because they are not on the market. They are. But we can't buy. We can't afford. The price is high [&#x02026;]. If things are fine and a boiled egg is 20 pesewas [&#x0223c;US$ 0.04] or 30 pesewas [&#x0223c;US$ 0.07], you will see the number of people eating eggs like nobody's business.

This was particularly raised in reference to Guinea fowl, snails, beef, and mutton. Study participants recognized that the high prices of ASFs are tied to costs of production, which are then passed onto consumers:<disp-quote><p>Now let's take meat - to feed the livestock and the drugs for their management is very expensive. What this means is that a kilogram of beef or mutton on the market is very high. People cannot afford it. So, you go to the market or the butchery. The meat is there. The butchers have slaughtered the animals, but the customers are not buying. The customer can't buy one kilogram of mutton or beef. Cost of production is so high.

This inequality was said to be linked to gender and age, although not all participants agreed with this viewpoint. A few male participants said ASF consumption patterns are gender-equal. However, the general view from the study was that within households, men consume more ASFs than women and adolescents:<disp-quote><p>Well, I think both men and women eat meat a lot.

It is possible that these reported barriers are influenced by level of education, poverty and socio-economic status. Given our FGD and KII data, however, we are unable to establish these associations, as we did not collect information on household wealth levels and educational background as determinants of ASF consumption. Nevertheless, there are numerous studies showing that better-off households are more likely than poorer households to purchase and consume ASFs (e.g., see <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Darapheak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kaur et al., 2017</xref>). Available studies further show that households where members have attained at least a secondary education are more likely to consume ASFs, and also be aware of the nutritional benefits of these foods (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Darapheak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">The most recent Ghanaian Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a marked upward trend of food prices since 2015, most notably for fish, meat, milk and eggs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service, 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) et al., 2015b</xref>). This higher CPI perhaps explains our respondents' concerns about the higher cost of ASFs, which leads to lower consumption of these foods. In 2015, for example, the cost of imported chicken was US$ 3 per kg, which increased to US$ 3.50 per kg in 2016 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ashitey, 2017</xref>).

In some cases, livestock housing was considered to be too close to human living quarters, especially kitchens and bedrooms, thus increasing infections, which were perceived to increase anemia. Perceived infection risks from livestock were associated with the need for more appropriate animal housing. Commonly mentioned infection concerns included skin rashes, malaria, and yaws. These perceived infection risks were more often mentioned by community participants, than the national, regional, and district stakeholders.

Here, participants suggested that two or more animals (preferably a female and a male) should be distributed to beneficiary households with the understanding that, over time, a specified number of female offspring will be passed on to other beneficiaries as repayment. Until the repayment is made, the original livestock is not deemed as &#x02018;owned&#x02019; by the first beneficiary. With this approach, participants perceived that ASFs would be more easily available and potentially be consumed. The distribution of chickens and small ruminants was frequently suggested for this intervention:<disp-quote><p>Normally, members in the villages are more prone to anemia. So, to reduce this problem through animal source foods, the government should give each household about 5 cockerels and 5 layers.

Other competing demands are often prioritized, of which income generation is foremost. High poverty levels in Ghana may underlie this priority on income generation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service, 2014</xref>). The proportion of Ghanaians living below the poverty line in 2014 was 18.8%, 50.4%, and 33.8% in the Central, Northern, and Volta Regions, respectively (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ghana Statistical Service, 2014</xref>; see also <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based on results from our study, raising livestock is often seen as a type of &#x02018;bank account&#x02019; or savings. This finding is supported by research from other African contexts (e.g. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chingala et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sumberg and Lankoand&#x000e9;, 2013</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sumberg and Lankoand&#x000e9; (2013)</xref> suggested that in rural areas, where banking and insurance services are limited, animals are kept as a &#x02018;walking bank&#x02019; or &#x02018;savings banks on the hoof&#x02019;. In other studies where farmers have prioritized the various motivations for raising livestock (e.g. for income, milk, manure, draught power, meat, and dowry), income generation has always been ranked first, and meat consumption usually last (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chingala et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0330">Aside from income generation, our results demonstrate that livestock and their products serve other social functions, which also reduce their importance for household consumption. Our results further indicate that even when livestock products are consumed, this tends to be highly regulated within the family. Specifically, young children and WRA, the demographic groups for which ASF consumption is most likely to be nutritionally beneficial, rarely consume these foods. An earlier study by <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colecraft et al. (2006)</xref> reported similar findings in Ghana's Central, Brong Ahafo, and Upper East Regions, showing that barriers to ASF consumption included inequitable allocation among women and young children (see also a more recent review by <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ruel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0335">Based on findings from our study, four specific interventions emerged as potential pathways for using livestock to reduce anemia in Ghana. <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> synthesizes the connections between the barriers identified and the interventions proposed. The red section of the table depicts identified/perceived barriers, and the green section illustrates proposed interventions. Each proposed intervention has strengths and limitations.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Connections between the barriers identified and interventions proposed.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Table 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></table-wrap></p><p id="p0340">Compared to other interventions, the first one, SBCC, requires relatively less technology and expense (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aboud and Singla, 2012</xref>). If appropriately contextualized, SBCC could effectively improve ASF consumption (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Osei et al., 2016</xref>). However, studies have demonstrated that people are often not receptive to interventions aimed at changing dietary behavior (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 2015</xref>). Only a few examples of truly successful, sustainable, and cost-effective SBCC interventions promoting livestock and ASF consumption have been reported (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Briscoe and Aboud, 2012</xref>). Often, structural barriers beyond the control of individuals are more crucial determinants of poor health than local attitudes and behaviors alone (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barnes, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our study suggests an apparent tension between suggestions coming from community participants, and those of national, regional and district stakeholders. While the non-community stakeholders recommended SBCC to encourage ASF consumption, households in FGDs clearly indicated that livestock are needed for income, not for consumption. Thus, SBCC efforts encouraging own-consumption of livestock could produce unintended negative consequences for household incomes and associated health outcomes.</p><p id="p0345">Improved housing and corralling of animals was the second intervention prioritized for reducing anemia through livestock production. Corralling domestic animals may reduce certain infections in people (e.g. <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>), thereby decreasing diarrhea and anemia prevalence (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Marquis et al., 1990</xref>). Contrasting evidence, however, indicates that corralling livestock may produce the opposite effect, and increase <italic>Campylobacter</italic>-related diarrhea in children (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Oberhelman et al., 2006</xref>). Costs associated with improved livestock housing are also a concern. It is expensive to feed and maintain livestock kept partly or permanently in a corral. For example, a 2003 study in Peru showed that a simple poultry corral costs roughly US$ 50 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>), yet households in Ghana's livestock-producing regions earn on average US$ 1.83 per day (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Such households may not easily invest one month's earnings in such a corral. Perhaps increasing poultry flock size could help address housing and feeding costs through more egg sales (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alemayehu et al., 2015</xref>). Another challenge is that animal housing may not be effective if implemented among only some households. Any benefits of corralling livestock from one household might be negated if animals from nearby households ran loose.</p><p id="p0350">Livestock-in-kind credit, the third identified intervention, also has its own strengths and weaknesses. The NGO Heifer International has employed this intervention in many countries, with some documented benefits. If livestock-in-kind credit were to successfully reduce anemia, either through increased ASF consumption or increased income, the benefits accruing to the original recipients could spread more quickly to other vulnerable groups (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayele and Peacock, 2003</xref>). This concept notwithstanding, results are mixed for actual nutritional impacts of livestock-in-kind credit programs. Only few studies have shown that these interventions actually increase ASF consumption and improve nutritional status (e.g., <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rawlins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayele and Peacock, 2003</xref>). Moreover, investment costs are considerable in livestock-in-kind credit programs. For example, a recent study in Rwanda found that it costs&#x0202f;&#x0223c;&#x0202f;US$ 3000 to give one cow to a household (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rawlins et al., 2014</xref>). Further, if farmers must provide their own initial housing and fodder, there is an additional cost of &#x0223c;US$ 300 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kabumbuli and Phelan, 2003</xref>). In the Ghanaian rural contexts of our study, this cost could be prohibitive, and also extends beyond providing just the animals. To be sustainable, this intervention requires expenditures to improve animal feeding systems and training of community-based livestock health workers (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayele and Peacock, 2003</xref>). Previous assessments of such an intervention showed that beneficiary households typically expect on-going support for housing, feeding, and animal disease management, thus putting a continuous strain on the initiating organization (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kabumbuli and Phelan, 2003</xref>). Given these limitations, and without broader investment in extension services, infrastructure, and institutions that support low-income farmers and livestock keepers, livestock-in-kind credit may not always be a feasible, cost-effective, or sustainable option.</p><p id="p0355">Hatchery management, the final intervention identified, also represents an opportunity, but with constraints. Such an intervention could improve the sourcing, care, and management of day-old chicks, while ensuring clean and contamination-free young animals, thus reducing vertical transmission of <italic>Campylobacter</italic> and other pathogens (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Kim, 2010</xref>). While hatchery management should improve chick health and survival, and reduce potential human contamination early in production, this intervention may not represent a comprehensive, long-term solution. It focuses solely on poultry early-life management, while neglecting post-hatchery husbandry practices. Also, it does not improve the broader range of livestock typically kept in Ghana, including goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">FAOSTAT, 2018</xref>). From the results of our study, inefficient hatchery systems are not seen as the most important limitation to reducing anemia or improving ASF consumption in Ghana. Hatchery management would therefore likely need to be integrated with other interventions to effectively reduce anemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>The specific contributions of this study</title><p id="p0360">This study contributes to the growing literature and expanding debate on nutrition-sensitive agriculture, specifically how animal agricultural production and capture could be leveraged to improve nutrition (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Berti and Cossio, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Blackmore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rawlins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ruel et al., 2018</xref>). There are several research gaps in the evidence base of how livestock interventions could improve nutrition outcomes. For example, there is still little research on the characteristics of successful livestock-nutrition programs, or how successful programs could be delivered at scale (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ruel et al., 2018</xref>). As many reviews have shown over the past two decades (e.g. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Blackmore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Leroy and Frongillo, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randolph et al., 2007</xref>), substantial challenges in operationalizing animal agricultural-nutrition linkages need to be overcome to better exploit potential opportunities. The findings from our investigation should enhance understanding of both the importance of animal agriculture for nutrition, and the conditionality of that importance on contextual factors. Specifically, we have shown that the social and economic context of livestock production and management must be thoughtfully considered in programs that seek to promote livestock production to increase ASF consumption. While the scientific literature suggests linkages among increased livestock production, greater income, and improved nutritional status (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Allen, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Randolph et al., 2007</xref>), our study shows that there are complex, practical challenges to promoting these relationships. Any intervention must, therefore, consider the diverse pathways through which changes to animal production may influence anemia, including through changes in ASF consumption and risks of infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0365">Our findings should be interpreted in context, taking into account the sample size and methodology used.

From the Ghanaian experience presented in this study, the first pathway is unlikely, unless efforts are made to purposefully encourage direct consumption of ASFs. The best potential lies in the second pathway; indeed, our results show that when income is generated from livestock, these funds are used to buy ASFs in smaller quantities, and also to pay for healthcare and other expenses that additionally should have direct and indirect impacts on anemia.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0030"><label>2.</label><p id="p0380">From the various interventions proposed by our study participants, the most feasible, sustainable, and relatively cost-effective appears to be an integration of proper livestock housing and SBCC. As indicated in our conceptual framework, nutritional pathways are not the only route through which livestock rearing may influence anemia. Exposure to microbial pathogens leading to subclinical and clinical infections is also an important pathway. Improving livestock housing could potentially help to reduce human infections caused by exposure to livestock and animal feces. These mechanisms are poorly understood in the Ghanaian context, yet have important implications for anemia risk. The integration and implementation of interventions to improve animal housing may directly address this pathway to anemia, but, as discussed above, there are several limitations. Livestock housing is very expensive, but costs could be minimized by using local materials. Furthermore, livestock housing interventions would need to address the hygiene of handling animals, which could be implemented using SBCC. However, not all livestock can be corralled, making SBCC all the more important for educating people on the potential health risks of allowing animals to free-range within household compounds and inside living quarters. If SBCC were to be implemented, it should be community-led as much as possible, with messages conveyed in a more entertaining way using channels relevant to local contexts. With careful and context-specific planning, it is possible for livestock production to make an important contribution to improving nutrition and mitigating anemia in Ghana and other developing country contexts.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aboud</surname><given-names>F.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Singla</surname><given-names>D.R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Challenges to changing health behaviours in developing countries: a critical overview</article-title><source>Soc.
