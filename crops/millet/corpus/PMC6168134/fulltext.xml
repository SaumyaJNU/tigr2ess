Research findings indicate that the crop has great nutritional and agronomic potential, but it remains scientifically neglected. A baseline study was conducted in seven districts in semi-arid regions of rural Zimbabwe to gather knowledge on current production and utilization of bambara groundnut, assess its role in providing sustainable food and nutrition security for rural populations and determine priorities for follow-up research. Results revealed a variety of bambara groundnut processing techniques, which included boiling, soaking, roasting and milling across the surveyed districts. Reported constraints to processing and consumption included long cooking time, difficulties with milling and high firewood and water requirements. Fifty to eighty percent of respondents in all districts consumed bambara groundnut once or twice weekly from August to December. Preferred consumer attributes were taste, the satiating effect, nutritional benefits or a combination of these. Current, culturally acceptable processing techniques need improvement to support sustainable bambara groundnut processing while optimising nutrient bio-accessibility. Ultimately, community resilience to food and nutrition insecurity can be promoted by exchange of bambara groundnut processing knowledge amongst the production areas, involving the different stakeholders in the food supply chains.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Netherlands Fellowship Programmes</institution></funding-source><award-id>CF9152/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9553-5830</contrib-id><name><surname>Mubaiwa</surname><given-names>Juliet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Netherlands Fellowship Programmes (grant award CF9152/2013).

Introduction</title><p>Subsistence farming and &#x02018;cash&#x02019; cropping (i.e. crop cultivation for income generation) are the foundation of sustainable food security for rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Zimbabwe and other sub-Saharan countries, subsistence farming depends on natural rainfall, making agricultural activities extremely sensitive to environmental changes [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. About 90% of the rural areas in Zimbabwe are situated in semi-arid agro-ecological regions (i.e. region III, IV and V) [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are characterised by low rainfall (&#x02264; 800 mm), making these regions unfavourable for intensive cropping of maize, the preferred staple cereal [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In recent years increasing weather variability and successive droughts have resulted in decreased agricultural productivity, thus negatively affecting food security. Meanwhile, agricultural organizations and policymakers have recognized the role and untapped potential of neglected and underutilized crops (NUS) for food and nutrition security, generating income in rural areas, adapting to climate change, and mitigating climatic, agronomic and economic risks [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Researchers recommend promoting the cultivation of indigenous, drought-tolerant crops, such as legumes, and among the proposed legumes is bambara groundnut (<italic>Vigna subterranea</italic> (L.) Verdc.), whose high adaptability makes it suitable for semi-arid regions where other crops fail to thrive [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to Hillocks [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the land area considered suitable for bambara groundnut cultivation is 84% for Zimbabwe, 100% for Swaziland, 98% for Uganda and 95% for Zambia.</p><p>Nutritionally, bambara groundnut represents a cheap protein-rich source that can improve the food and nutrition security status of rural households. Biochemical analysis of the carbohydrate, fat, protein and mineral content reveals that bambara groundnut produces an almost balanced diet. The nut was found to be richer in essential amino acids than groundnut [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with a protein score of 80% as compared to 65% for groundnut, 74% for soya bean and 64% for cowpea [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, like other legumes, bambara groundnut lacks sulphur-containing proteins, thus blending with a staple cereal such as maize, which contains higher levels of sulphur-containing amino acids, results in a complete food [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Bambara groundnut contains micronutrients such as zinc, iron, calcium and potassium. Red-seed varieties have almost twice as much iron as the cream seeds. Thus, they are especially valuable in areas where iron deficiency occurs [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Freshly harvested and dry bambara groundnut are consumed in many ways after processing. Freshly harvested seeds are consumed as snacks after grilling or boiling for approximately an hour [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Dry seeds are boiled or first soaked then boiled to make a snack or porridge [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Dried seeds are difficult to grind due to their hard and tightly fitting seed coat. These seeds are pounded to flour, which is baked to make small flat cakes and bread [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In Eastern Africa, bambara groundnuts are roasted, milled, and the flour is used to make a soup, a relish, and also a substitute for coffee. Additionally, a thin porridge [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and stiff porridge can be made from the flour [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite all these possible uses and the nutritional and agronomic potential, bambara groundnut remains scientifically neglected [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. An important reason for underutilization is the hard-to-cook (HTC) phenomenon in combination with inadequate processing techniques [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. HTC in legumes is characterized by extended cooking time (3&#x02013;4 h) [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] needed to ensure adequate softening during cooking [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the hard seed coat makes dehulling challenging [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HTC in legumes is associated with structural cell modifications (e.g. autolysis of cytoplasmic organelles and lignification of middle lamella) and compositional changes (e.g. formation of insoluble pectate and interactions of proteins and phenolic compounds), which occur in the cotyledons and seed coats [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The HTC problem may not seem serious to people living in developed countries, who have energy resources and state-of-the-art techniques to utilize HTC legumes as well as access to a variety of protein-rich foods. However, due to the ravages of protein deficiencies, this food source is indispensable for people living in subsistence conditions who cannot afford meat [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to Burchi, Fanzo [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], there are four dimensions of food security, namely food availability, food accessibility, food utilization and stability. In terms of production, bambara groundnut is managed in a traditional manner, e.g. by women who use informal seed sources and give it a low priority in land allocation [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, bambara groundnut is frequently available and accessible to rural households but underutilized because of processing bottlenecks [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], causing a lack of diversity in rural diets [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the past decades, processing solutions were developed to improve the quality of local food products as well as their shelf life, but these are often not applicable for resource-limited rural communities [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, sustainable processing approaches that fit the local social-cultural framework in rural Zimbabwe and other sub-Saharan communities are urgently needed [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Processing methods for HTC legumes used in other sub-Saharan countries, such as Ghana and Nigeria, include chemical treatments (<italic>cooking aids</italic>), biological treatments (<italic>germination and fermentation</italic>), and physical treatments (<italic>milling</italic>, <italic>roasting and canning</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This paper examines the factors that affect the role of this crop in the broader context of production, processing, consumption and trade in the Zimbabwean context. The objective of the study was to take stock of the indigenous knowledge on the bambara groundnut value chains to gain insight in the way in which this protein-rich crop contributes to sustainable food and nutrition security in semi-arid regions. This research documented the current land allocation for crops and traditional processing methods for bambara groundnut in Zimbabwe. The study also assessed processing constraints and analysed the preference and consumption frequency of bambara groundnut. Specific research questions guiding the research include: (i) why do people consume bambara groundnut, and why not?, (ii) what do consumers like about this food, and what not?, (iii) what is the perception of processors on bambara groundnut processing techniques, which are the best methods and what are the problems?, (iv) how do use and processing techniques compare between districts and neighbouring countries?, and (v) does cultural background have a role on crop utilization?</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Methodology</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1. Study area</title><p>Data were collected in rural areas in the driest parts of Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g001">Fig 1</xref>), specifically in agro-ecological region III (Uzumba and Binga (Lusulu), IV (Buhera, Mudzi, Pfungwe and Lower Gweru) and V (Bikita), see <xref rid="pone.0204817.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Region III receives 500&#x02013;800 mm annual rainfall and is subject to seasonal droughts and severe mid-season dry spells. Region IV receives 450&#x02013;650 mm annual rainfall and is characterised by frequent seasonal droughts and severe dry spells during the rainy season. Region V receives less than 450 mm annual rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A mixed sampling approach was applied at different stages, starting with a &#x02018;snowball approach&#x02019; through use of network referencing [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] at Mbare farmers&#x02019; market (17&#x000b0; 51&#x02032; S, 31&#x000b0; 2&#x02032; E) in Harare (i.e. the largest informal market for agro-produce in Zimbabwe) to establish current locations of key farming areas and growers/suppliers of bambara groundnut. This was followed by judgement sampling [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] using the expert opinions of <italic>eMKambo</italic> (an organisation that records the movement of agro-produce in informal markets in Zimbabwe) and the Department of Research and Speciality Services (DRSS). DRSS is a government department mandated to provide research-based technologies and technical information for advisory services to support enhanced agricultural productivity.

Field data collection and sampling of respondents</title><p>Surveys to gather data were conducted from May to December 2014. The DRSS and the Department of Agricultural Extension Services (Agritex), both under the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Settlement in Zimbabwe approved the study. Study areas were visited prior to the surveys for familiarization with the communities. Ward councillors, Agritex officers and village headmen were consulted before meeting household representatives to obtain verbal informed consent after explanation of research intentions and protocols. Respondents were notified of the forthcoming study and also their written informed consent was obtained before the interview. For the sampling plan, Boyd, Westfall [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] recommend a sample size of at least 5% of the total population. A sample representing 5% of the total number of households in a ward was randomly drawn from a list of households supplied by Agritex officers. A ward is defined as an administrative municipal in a district that is subdivided into villages [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A household was defined as all members, related or unrelated, who share the same dwelling unit. Data were collected from at least five selected villages in identified wards (ward size average 8&#x02013;11 villages).

The patriarchal factor becomes relevant in legume land allocation as reiterated by the respondents, agreeing with previous researchers, who reported bambara groundnut to be a women&#x02019;s crop [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, Binga and Buhera districts were exceptions; here both men and women were involved in production because bambara groundnut is a cash crop to them. Results reveal that households in different districts esteem legume crops contrarily, such that Bikita, Binga and Buhera prioritize bambara groundnut, Uzumba and Pfungwe prioritize groundnut, and Mudzi and Lower Gweru allocate approximately equally areas for the three legumes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) regarding bambara groundnut land allocation in different agro-ecological regions was not logical to perform because of unbalanced representation of regions. For this reason, analysis of variance in land allocation for crops was performed at district level, which resulted in a significant effect of district on land allocation for all crops including bambara groundnut at p &#x0003c; 0.05 level, e.g. bambara groundnut [F (6, 224) = 21.5, p = 0.000]. Although the sampling method was not completely randomised, it still properly represents land allocation by the populations in the regions and districts visited.</p><p>Land allocation among legumes is not a clear indicator of rainfall patterns in the districts, except for Uzumba in region III, an area considered to be good for groundnut production [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Land allocation for legumes seems to be governed by end use, which could be income generation, consumption or both. Those who grow bambara groundnut as a cash crop, allocate more land to its cultivation (i.e. Binga and Buhera). In contrast, cowpea is mostly grown as a dual crop for exploiting both the leaves as relish eaten with thick maize porridge and the seeds as boiled snack; this was not so for bambara groundnut [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The downside of bambara groundnut production as compared to cowpea was the labour intensity due to the essential &#x02018;earthing up&#x02019; and the harvesting that requires pulling the crop out of the soil. From these findings, land allocation of maize reflects the amount of rainfall received, while land allocation for legumes reflects the significance of end use.</p><p>To produce bambara groundnut, female farmers, who are the custodians of the crop, use seeds from their previous harvest, from relatives or buy seeds in the market place [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Commercially produced seeds are not available [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, sharing and using seeds from the previous crop bring convenience, community self-sustenance and the continuation of local customs that brings value to traditional systems [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Unfortunately, these practices sometimes result in poor germination and reduced yield as reported in some districts, agreeing with De Kock [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This points toward the need to expedite bambara groundnut breeding programs to improve the quality of seed sources.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0204817.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows bambara groundnut seed selection practices in various districts, indicating that some respondents cultivate selected landraces, while others used mixed landraces, contradicting Plahar [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], who reported sole cultivation of mixed landraces in Zimbabwe. Respondents clarified the need for seed selection to be driven by some markets places. This development appears to be beneficial to farmers in terms of production as they are able to assess landrace performance in terms of drought tolerance and yield. If this is pursued over a period of time, breeders will have starting points as part of the preliminary work to develop better varieties would already have been accomplished by farmers [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Most respondents (63.6%) knew about the agronomical benefits of bambara groundnut farming, i.e. improved soil fertility [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and accordingly did not use fertilizers [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Fortunately, bambara groundnut does well even with low input farming and poor soils [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], ensuring a definite harvest and food availability for these already financially constrained farmers [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The distribution of bambara groundnut production is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g002">Fig 2</xref>.

Local trading of bambara groundnut for income generation and exporting to neighbouring countries such as South Africa was previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]According to Plahar, Annan [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the biggest exporter of bambara groundnut in Africa is Zimbabwe with exports estimated between 1,500 and 3,000 tonnes per year. Currently, bambara groundnut is cultivated for home consumption, batter trade (i.e. exchange of goods), as income generator for a household&#x02019;s sustenance or a combination of these factors, concurring with the findings of Quaye and Johnson-Kanda [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] in Ghana. Fifty to eighty-eight percent of the households sold bambara groundnut locally or at farmers&#x02019; markets and/or exported to neighbouring countries either in their capacity or through middle-persons, who link them to informal and formal markets (e.g. supermarkets). Traders in Buhera and Bikita exported to South Africa, whilst Mudzi farmers sold at Nyamapanda (a border post with Mozambique), agreeing with the reports by Plahar, Annan [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This shows the complexity of the bambara groundnut supply chain and the potential to improve the trading network.</p><p>The bambara groundnut trading places visited were Harare (Mbare and Lusaka farmers&#x02019; markets) and Chitungwiza (Chikwanha and Makoni farmers&#x02019; markets). The largest suppliers of bambara groundnut at these market places included farmers from Buhera, Bikita, Wedza, Uzumba, Maramba and Pfungwe districts. The traders at the market places reported all year round availability of dry bambara groundnuts, and that selling price drivers included season and supply, i.e. the seeds become more expensive towards the next planting season [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As previously reported by farmers, bambara groundnut sold was of mixed and individual landraces. Those who bought selected landraces typically used them for seed-fair shows or religious purposes, <italic>viz</italic>. especially the black-seeded landrace. As for market price, 83% of respondents reported a higher price for bambara groundnut than cowpea, whilst mixed reviews on bambara groundnut versus groundnut were given. The average selling price for bambara groundnut was 3.5 to 4 US$ per kg in local supermarkets. The recorded prices of a 20-litre bucket of dried and shelled cowpea, groundnut and bambara groundnut as of December 2015 were 10, 20 and 23 US$, respectively, at Mbare farmers&#x02019; market. The high price for bambara groundnut emphasized its importance for income generation and indicates why this crop should be given more priority.</p><p>No common criteria like a grading system for measuring the quality of bambara groundnut for trading was in place. Quality aspects considered included taste (based on previous experience), colour, size, plumpness, and absence of weevils and rot.

To prove this concept, an association between the firewood accessibility constraints and processing constraints of bambara groundnut was tested. Many respondents (79.2%) with difficulties in firewood access reported constraints in processing (long cooking time), whereas 38.5% of those with easy access reported problems of processing, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1) = 38.352, p &#x0003c; 0.001, N = 231. Firewood accessibility was not a limiting factor for approximately 50% of respondents in Pfungwe and Uzumba as they still had sufficient trees in their forests or had adjusted to the time it takes to boil the legume, whereas respondents in Bikita and Buhera complained of firewood shortages, indicating deforestation in the area. On the other hand, Binga and Pfungwe respondents reported shortages of potable water as a limiting factor since boiling takes a lot of water.

In addition, Buhera respondents (9.7%) were aware of cooking aids such as <italic>kanwa</italic> that is widely applied in West African countries (e.g. Ghana and Nigeria) to reduce cooking time [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], but were against them because of gastrointestinal problems (laxative effect) and altered sensorial attributes [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. <italic>Kanwa</italic> is known as <italic>gowa</italic> in some parts of Zimbabwe, where it is used as a tenderizer in cooking leafy vegetables, common beans, and okra [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], but is rarely used for bambara groundnut. Since taste is the main attribute liked by bambara groundnut consumers in Zimbabwe, processing solutions that address the HTC phenomenon must not negatively impact sensorial properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>3.3.2. Alternative products</title><p>Bambara groundnuts may also be roasted to produce diverse products such as roasted snacks, <italic>rupiza</italic> (dehulled grits), pre-soaked <italic>mutakura</italic> grits and bambara groundnut milk as shown in <xref rid="pone.0204817.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Roasting and soaking are pre-treatments employed prior to further processing of bambara groundnut into different products as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Soaking prior to drying, roasting and milling is employed for easy removal of the seed coats in the preparation of pre-soaked <italic>mutakura</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>Rupiza</italic> is a product mainly of dry-roasted cowpea [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204817.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and occasionally bambara groundnuts made by coarse milling to produce grits, which are boiled and mixed with peanut butter before serving. Generally, 12% of the respondents were aware of bambara groundnut <italic>rupiza</italic>, with a better awareness in Uzumba and Pfungwe. Bambara groundnut <italic>rupiza</italic> takes 45 min to 1 h to boil and this cooking time is comparable to the boiling time of freshly harvested bambara groundnut pods [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Hence <italic>rupiza</italic> production is a solution to the problem of the long cooking time with a 75% reduction in cooking time as compared to cooking with alkaline salts [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the use of traditional milling tools is a tedious time and energy consuming process [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] due to the thick seed coat and strong attachment between the seed coat and cotyledons caused by mucilage and gums at the interface [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Using commercial, locally available grinding machines can facilitate this issue.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows different types of flour produced in surveyed districts. The intensity of dry roasting differentiates between the production of coffee and flour; to produce coffee, dark roasting is performed. Bambara groundnut-based coffee is a substitute for tea for 80% of the respondents in Uzumba. In a study by Nti [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], an improved method of producing flour in Nigeria involves soaking seeds in water for 30 min, boiling for 25 min, and thereafter drying at 60&#x02013;65&#x000b0;C in a hot air dryer for 10 h. Products of moist heat treatment and dehulling enhanced consumer appeal for both traditional and newly formulated bambara groundnut foods. In terms of district application, bambara groundnut and wheat flour blends are used for bread making and fritters as previously reported by De Kock [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], whilst a blend of bambara groundnut and maize flour (including other optional ingredients) is used to make a nutritious porridge. In all districts, no clear distinction for the applications of produced flour were encountered, i.e. whether flours are multipurpose or ideal for specific applications.</p><p>A minor product of roasting and boiling is the production of bambara groundnut milk previously reported by Murevanhema and Jideani [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and Poulter and Caygill [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], whereby bambara groundnut is soaked overnight and thereafter dehulled to remove the seed coats. Dehulled bambara groundnuts are then roasted, mixed with water (ratio 1:5), crushed until the water changes in colour and the seeds have been reduced in size. Afterwards, the milk is filtered (residue removal) and boiled (optionally) to remove odours and then added to tea [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. According to Poulter and Caygill [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], raw and pasteurised bambara groundnut milk contained 2.0 g protein per 100 ml.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>3.4. Legume preference and consumption</title><p>Legume consumption preferences results, i.e., bambara groundnut, cowpea and groundnut, across districts showed that 93.3% of respondents in Lower Gweru highly ranked bambara groundnut followed by 50&#x02013;60% in Bikita, Mudzi, and Buhera, whilst a minority of consumers in Pfungwe and Uzumba (25%) preferred it most. Overall, 42% of respondents prefer bambara groundnut as compared to 31% and 29% who prefer groundnut and cowpea, respectively.</p><p>Consumption frequency of dry bambara groundnut in districts varied as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Respondents (50&#x02013;80%) in all districts consumed bambara groundnut once to twice a week (i.e. especially from August to December). Exceptions were in Binga, where 45% of respondents reportedly consume bambara groundnut every day in summer followed by 33% in Bikita. The preferred attributes of bambara groundnut from a consumer perspective were taste, the satiating effect, its nutritional benefits or a combination of these attributes.</p><fig id="pone.0204817.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204817.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Consumption frequency of bambara groundnut in various districts (as percentage of respondents).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0204817.g004"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204817.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the relationship between consumption frequency and these preferred attributes. Assessment of linkages shows that 43% of respondents who consume bambara groundnut everyday prefer its taste, whilst 38% of everyday consumers also prefer a combination of attributes (nutrition, satiety and taste). Nutrition as an independent attribute scores low, but this is not surprising as some respondents did not have any knowledge about the nutritional importance of bambara groundnut (i.e., as a source of protein). Overall, 39.4% of respondents appreciated a combination of nutrition, satiety and taste of bambara groundnut, thus any alteration in processing that distorts this is undesirable.</p><fig id="pone.0204817.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204817.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Relationship between consumption frequency of bambara groundnut and preferred attributes (as percentage of respondents).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0204817.g005"/></fig><p>The relationship between consumption frequency and bambara groundnut ranking shows that respondents who highly ranked bambara groundnut were frequent consumers (i.e. 59.1% everyday consumers and 50.8% twice-a-week consumers). Nevertheless, even intermittent consumers (i.e. once a week and once a fortnight) ranked bambara groundnut fairly high, namely 45 and 48%, respectively. These frequencies show the contribution of crop to dietary diversity and food security. Unfortunately, some who consume bambara groundnuts complain of stomach pain, flatulence and general discomfort. This mostly concerns bambara groundnut and not cowpea. This could mean that bambara groundnut contains a higher amount of flatus-causing oligosaccharides than cowpea [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], implying the need to address this problem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>4. Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>The findings from the land allocation for crops in semi-arid districts in Zimbabwe show that farmers practise crop diversification and are aware of crops that suit their agro-ecological zones. Land allocation for legumes is governed by end use such as income generation, consumption or both. Lack of commercial seeds is a major problem in bambara groundnut farming, but a positive development of farming selected seed is identified as a step towards preliminary breeding programs to obtain drought tolerance and increased yields. The bambara groundnut value chain is characterised by the absence of stipulated grading systems, which show how relegated the crop is. Development of standard grading systems is highly recommended.</p><p>The survey showed soaking, boiling, dehulling, roasting and milling as important processing techniques for bambara groundnut in Zimbabwe, but there was no clear cultural trend on processing diversity.</p><p>The goal of legume processing is not only to solve HTC phenomena but also to retain the important sensorial and nutritional aspects of the legume-based products. The processing techniques can be evaluated from various angles, such as sustainability of the method, i.e. firewood and water consumption, processing time and aptitude, as well as the sensorial and nutritional aspects of the final product. The high-energy consumption, water and firewood scarcity are important factors limiting bambara groundnut preparation and consumption. Deforestation and excessive water consumption are serious problems reducing the sustainability index of bambara groundnut. These findings necessitate investigating the correlation between processing aptitude of processing techniques and sustainability indicators to optimise current processing methods. Appraisal of nutrient bioaccessibility and product functionality are necessary in evaluating the quality of the food products. As such, protein digestibility and micronutrient bioaccessibility studies are paramount as nutrient deficiency is still a problem that plagues sub-Saharan African communities compounded by the ravages of HIV and AIDS [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The limited information exchange as evidenced by variation in processing activities in various districts demonstrate the need for this exercise, i.e. among local Zimbabwe communities and in the other sub-Saharan region, for improved food security [<xref rid="pone.0204817.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Non-governmental organizations are recommended to carry out awareness and sensitization workshops for information sharing and oversee adoption of new techniques in different areas. The government, through the ministries of agriculture, nutrition and health, is recommended to authorize policy incentives on legume farming and processing. Studies on the food technological and nutritional aspects of bambara groundnut based products are recommended. Ultimately, knowledge sharing, education, building from existing strategies and applied researches are essential interventions for improving food and nutrition security through bambara groundnut.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204817.s001"><label>S1 Questionnaire</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204817.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204817.s002"><label>S1 Survey Data</label><caption><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204817.s002.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The enthusiastic participation of farmers in surveyed districts is greatly appreciated together with the contributions of Patrick Kasasa (Community Technology Development Trust, Zimbabwe), Prince Matova (Department of Research and Specialist Services, Zimbabwe) and Knowledge Transfer Africa (KTA).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0204817.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Matsa</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mukoni</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>Traditional science of seed and crop yield preservation: exploring the contributions of women to indigenous knowledge systems in Zimbabwe</article-title>. <source>Int J Hum Soc Sci</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>234</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>45</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0204817.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shiferaw</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Prasanna</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hellin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>B&#x000e4;nziger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>Crops that feed the world 6.
