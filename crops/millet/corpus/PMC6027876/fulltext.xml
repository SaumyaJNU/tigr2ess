In India, a great deal of public and private sectors&#x02019; investment has focused on developing pearl millet single cross hybrids based on the cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility (CMS) system, while in Africa most pearl millet production relies on open pollinated varieties. Pearl millet lines were phenotyped for both the inbred parents and hybrids stage. Many breeding efforts focus on phenotypic selection of inbred parents to generate improved parental lines and hybrids. This study evaluated two genotyping techniques and four genomic selection schemes in pearl millet. Despite the fact that 6&#x000d7; more sequencing data were generated per sample for RAD-seq than for tGBS, tGBS yielded more than 2&#x000d7; as many informative SNPs (defined as those having MAF &#x0003e; 0.05) than RAD-seq. A genomic prediction scheme utilizing only data from hybrids generated prediction accuracies (median) ranging from 0.73-0.74 (1000-grain weight), 0.87-0.89 (days to flowering time), 0.48-0.51 (grain yield) and 0.72-0.73 (plant height). For traits with little to no heterosis, hybrid only and hybrid/inbred prediction schemes performed almost equivalently. For traits with significant mid-parent heterosis, the direct inclusion of phenotypic data from inbred lines significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) reduced prediction accuracy when all lines were analyzed together. However, when inbreds and hybrid trait values were both scored relative to the mean trait values for the respective populations, the inclusion of inbred phenotypic datasets moderately improved genomic predictions of the hybrid genomic estimated breeding values. Here we show that modern approaches to genotyping by sequencing can enable genomic selection in pearl millet. While historical pearl millet breeding records include a wealth of phenotypic data from inbred lines, we demonstrate that the naive incorporation of this data into a hybrid breeding program can reduce prediction accuracy, while controlling for the effects of heterosis <italic>per se</italic> allowed inbred genotype and trait data to improve the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values for pearl millet hybrids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pearl millet</kwd><kwd>Genomic Selection</kwd><kwd>hybrid breeding</kwd><kwd>genotyping</kwd><kwd>GenPred</kwd><kwd>Shared Data Resources</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="3"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Pearl millet [<italic>Cenchrus americanus</italic> (L.) Morrone; Syn. <italic>Pennisetum glaucum</italic> (L.) R. Br.] is able to grow on infertile and marginal soils under limiting soil moisture conditions and high soil temperatures. It is a climate resilient species, and is one of the most widely grown millets globally <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ramya <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref>. Pearl millet can thrive in arid environments, and successfully set seed at temperatures above 40&#x000b0;, which would kill the pollen/stigmas of many other grain crops <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref>. Pearl millet can also tolerate infertile and marginal soils, limited soil moisture, and high soil temperatures. While most pearl millet production in Africa utilizes open pollinated varieties, Indian pearl millet production now makes extensive use of hybrid seed generated using three line cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility systems (CMS) <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Hanna (1989)</xref>. Three line CMS systems employ female lines which carry male sterile cytoplasm and non-restoring nuclear gene(s) (A-lines), maintainer lines carry an identical nuclear genome to each A-line in a compatible fertile cytoplasm, resulting in male fertile plants (B-lines) and are able to maintain the male sterility of A-line, and pollinator/male lines which carry dominant nuclear restorer of fertility gene(s) (R-lines).</p><p>Plant breeding for hybrid crops requires generating and testing large numbers of hybrids under different field conditions. Performing crosses to generate F1 hybrids is a labor intensive process. Top-crossing between B- and R-lines can reduce the amount of labor required per cross, but only in crossing schemes where many female lines are being crossed to one or a few male lines. Evaluating each new hybrid across field trials with several environments also requires significant time and resources. As a result, methods for selecting parental inbred lines and determining which crosses are likely to yield the best hybrids is a critical part of crop improvement. In pearl millet, a widespread approach has been used to evaluate the phenotypes of new potential inbred parents as a first pass screen of their potential in hybrid breeding programs.</p><p>Traditionally, mid-parental values have been a common way to predict performance of hybrids on the basis of inbred values, combined with estimates of General Combining Ability (GCA) in cases where phenotypes cannot be scored in parental lines or individuals directly <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gowda <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Xing <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;hleisen <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref>. However, for traits where significant heterosis exists, the phenotypes of hybrids can vary significantly from what would be predicted through the use of mid-parent values and estimated GCA. In these cases, it can be necessary to estimate Specific Combining Ability (SCA) values for each potential cross. The incorporation of genetic markers can improve the accuracy with which both GCA and SCA can be predicted by enabling the sharing of data across multiple tested lines carrying common haplotypes <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Schrag <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref>. When applied to sets of genetic markers across the whole genome, this process is referred to as genomic prediction (GP), which can be used to implement breeding programs based on estimated breeding values from genome wide sets of markers, a process know as genomic selection (GS).</p><p>Approximately 90-100 pearl millet hybrids are currently cultivated on about 5 million hectares in India <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Yadav <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>. Both public and private sector organizations, including 30-40 seed companies, perform thousands of test-crosses each year. Resulting hybrids are then evaluated over multiple years and multiple locations to identify small numbers of new hybrids with superior performance which can be marketed/released for cultivation. The high investment of time and resources into initial hybrid evaluation would benefit significantly from the use of GP/GS to exclude many potential test crosses which can be discarded as unlikely to outperform existing hybrids prior to field evaluation, reducing the vast number of crosses which must be performed and evaluated.</p><p>The use of GP/GS to obtain estimated breeding values have been widely evaluated and employed in inbreeding crops such as wheat <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Poland <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>, barley <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref>, rice <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Spindel <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref>. In crops where production is based upon hybrids, genomic prediction for single-cross hybrid performance are only starting to appear in the public sector literature <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Technow <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kadam <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>, although genomic predictions for hybrid performance across populations all crossed to a single common tester are more common <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Windhausen <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref>. Pearl millet presents an intriguing opportunity in that both hybrid and open pollinated production systems are widely employed, and phenotypic data are thus available from both hybrids and inbred R- and B- lines.

The Hisar and Jamnagar sites fall within the A zone of pearl millet cultivation in northwest India, while Dhule and Patancheru are located in the B zone of pearl millet cultivation in southern (peninsular) India <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. While pearl millet is also grown in the A1 zone - highly drought prone areas with less than 400 mm of rainfall per year - the majority of hybrid pearl millet is confined to the A and B agroecological zones. Data were collected from 320 hybrids and 37 inbreds at field trials in four locations in 2015 in India (Dhule: N20.90&#x000b0;,E74.77&#x000b0;; Patancheru: N17.53&#x000b0;,E78.27&#x000b0;; Jamnagar: N22.47&#x000b0;,E70.06&#x000b0; and Hisar: N29.10&#x000b0;,E75.46&#x000b0;). In CMS system, A-lines are sterile and hence will not produce grain when grown in isolation. Therefore, genotyping and phenotyping were conducted on non-sterile B-lines carrying the same nuclear genome as A-lines in a compatible cytoplasm, rendering them male fertile. Lines in plots were grown in an alpha lattice design with two replicates and 28 15-plot blocks in each location. Each block included two common control lines/hybrids (ICMH 356 and 9444) and 13 experimental lines. Hybrid plots were randomly assigned to the first 25 blocks of each replicate, and inbred plots were randomly assigned to the last three blocks of each replicate (Experimental design, plot distribution and recorded phenotypes was provided in FigShare <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/pearl_millet_genomic_selection_field_layout/5969230">https://figshare.com/articles/pearl_millet_genomic_selection_field_layout/5969230</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Phenotype measurement</title><p>Phenotypic traits scored include days to 50% flowering (days), plant height (centimeters), grain yield (kilograms/hectare), and 1000-grain weight (grams). The criteria used to measure each of these four traits were as follows. 1) Plant height (centimeters): Plant height for a given plant was measured from where the main stem meets to soil to the tip of the panicle of the primary tiller at the time of harvest. For each plot, five random plants were randomly selected for height measurements and the mean value of these five measurements was reported; 2) Days to 50% flowering (days): Days to flowering was measured as the time between the planting date and the date at which at least 50% of plants within a given plot exhibited the initiation of stigma emergence on the panicle of their primary tiller; 3) 1000 seed weight (grams): 200 seeds were counted out from the pooled grain collected from a given research plot, weighed, and multiplied by a factor of 5 to determine 1000 seed weight (grams); 4) Grain yield (kilograms/hectare): For each entry, all panicles within a given a plot were harvested at physiological maturity, and these panicles were sun dried for 10 to 15 days and then threshed for grain yield. Planting density and plot size varied across locations, but for each location the total yield was multiplied by the number of plots per hectare to estimate the final yield per hectare.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DNA extraction and library construction</title><p>Thirty to thirty five seeds from each inbred line were sown in a four inch pot in a darkroom at ICRISAT&#x000b0;s Patancheru.

For each trait, the pattern of relative contribution of each of these factors was roughly similar between inbred and hybrid pearl millet populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Plant height was the trait with the greatest proportion of variance explained by purely genetic factors, while flowering time had the great proportion of variance explained by environments. As expected, grain yield had the highest residual value, making this critical trait the most difficult to predict accurately using quantitative genetic models. Broad sense heritability &#x02013; <italic>i.e.</italic>, the proportion of total variance in trait values explained by genetic factors &#x02013; for grain yield, plant height, flowering time and 1000-grain weight were estimated to be 0.60, 0.86, 0.88 and 0.74 respectively for pearl millet hybrids and 0.72, 0.92, 0.88 and 0.74 for inbreds. However, caution should be used in interpreting differences between the inbred and hybrid heritability values, given the large difference in the number of individuals between the two populations. BLUP values were calculated for these four traits (see methods). Each trait exhibited an approximately normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Heterosis can be defined in different ways but the definition employed here is mid-parent heterosis which is the degree to which the measured trait values of hybrids tend to exceed the average of measured values for the same trait in both parents. Mid-parent heterosis was observed for all four traits with median values of 8% (flowering time), 15% (1000-grain weight), 37% (plant height) and 84% (grain yield) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note that the direct of effect for heterosis was reversed for flowering time.

The missing data rates for RAD-seq genotypes exhibited a bimodal distribution while tGBS genotypes exhibited a unimodal distribution skewed toward high missing data rates. RAD-seq genotyping was much less likely to genotype sites as heterozygous, which may reflect a difference in the technologies, or may be explained by the observation that many SNPs identified by RAD-seq had low minor allele frequencies, while tGBS SNPs, tended to have higher minor allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Scheme M1, which used trait trait from inbreds to predict genomic estimated breeding values of hybrids performed the worst of all four approaches for all four phenotypic traits tested. Notably, the rank of traits by mid-parent heterosis had a perfect negative correlation with the rank of the traits by phenotypic prediction accuracy using inbred parent training data. Scheme 2 (M2) produced a significant increase (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in accuracy relative to the scheme 1 (M1) for all four phenotypes, although, consistent with its high residual values when fitting the original BLUP, the accuracy of prediction for yield was the lowest of the four phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Scheme 3A (M3A), which merged phenotypes from both inbred parents and hybrid trials to predict hybrid trials performed equivalently to scheme 2 (M2) for 1000-grain weight (1kwt) and flowering time (D2F), the two traits with the lowest degree of mid-parent heterosis. However, for traits with significant amounts of mid-parent heterosis (grain yield and plant height), adding inbred parent phenotype data to the prediction model either provided no benefit (plant height, <italic>P</italic> = 0.17) or significant <italic>decreases</italic> in prediction accuracy (grain yield, <italic>P</italic> = 0.09e-2) compared to a purely hybrid phenotype data training set.

However, even 64 (2<sup>6</sup>) random SNPs provided significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) predictive ability for all traits and all schemes tested. The relatively small set of inbred parents used to create the set of hybrids tested as part of this analysis may have resulted in inflated apparent prediction accuracies for each trait. When using a hold-two-parents out approach to segregating hybrids with common parentage between the training and testing datasets (see Methods), accuracy was lower and standard deviations of prediction accuracy were higher (Figure S2), indicating that our estimates of prediction accuracy are likely to be optimistic relative to the ability to predictions for hybrids where one or both parents have not previously served as parents for tested hybrids.</p><p>Finally, grain yield and time to flowering were predicted for every possible F1 hybrid between a genotyped A/B-line and a genotyped R-line in the dataset. Within this prediction space, the highest yielding potential hybrids tend to be associated with somewhat longer flowering times defining a production possibility frontier for the trade off between growing season length and yield among the pearl millet hybrids which could be generated using the inbred germplasm genotyped as part of this study (Figure S3).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s15"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we found that the naive integration of trait data collected from inbred lines into genomic prediction for a hybrid breeding program can actually reduce prediction accuracy, particularly for traits exhibiting significant heterosis. However, controlling for the effect of heterosis <italic>per se</italic> by calculating BLUPs separated for inbred and hybrid lines eliminated this negative impact on prediction accuracy and could in fact increase prediction accuracy for some traits relative to predicting using data from hybrid lines alone. In addition we found prediction accuracy was equivalent for SNPs generated through either RAD-seq or tGBS. Given the greater number of high MAF (&#x0003e;0.05) SNPs generated per million reads with tGBS, this methodology is likely to be more cost effective in the context of many genomic selection based breeding programs. In addition, the more rapid turn-around time enabled by Ion Proton sequencing (<inline-formula><mml:math id="me13"><mml:mo>&#x0223c;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>4 hr) relative to Illumina HiSeq 2000 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="me14"><mml:mo>&#x0223c;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>8 days for 2x100 sequencing) increases the feasibility the utilizing genomic prediction to guide real time breeding decisions. However, it should also be noted that there is nothing inherent about either the RAD-seq or tGBS protocol which prevents the adaptation of either protocol to sequencing using either instrument.</p><p>Longer growing seasons will generally &#x02013; in the absence of constraints from temperature, or resources abundance &#x02013; result in more total fixed carbon <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Dohleman and Long (2009)</xref>. Whether this increase in carbon fixation results in an increase in yield depends, among other factors on harvest index, the partitioning of carbon between vegetative and reproductive development. In our data, grain yield displayed only weak correlations with flowering time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Grain yield and plant height show a strong positive correlation with each other which is not what would be expected based on models of carbon partitioning. One potential explanation is that, in small plot trials with substantial height variation among accessions, tall plots can shade shorter plots if the experimental design is not blocked by height. This shading effect produces an apparent yield penalty for short accessions which does not translate to larger scale yield trials or commercial production. However, there may also be significant room to improve the yield and resource use efficiency of pearl millet through selection for improved harvest index. A second explanation is loci responsible for tolerance of heat and or drought stress are segregating in the population, sensitive genotypes are likely to exhibit both stunted growth and low grain yields, as pearl millet is grown in marginal soils and high levels of abiotic stress (high temperatures and water constraint).</p><p>As described above, we found that the naive incorporation of inbred genotype and trait information into training datasets decreased prediction accuacy for high heterosis traits. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we propose a model to explain this finding. When BLUP values for a trait with a high degree of heterosis are calculated in a population containing a mix of inbred and hybrid individuals, most inbreds will be assigned negative BLUP scores and most hybrids postive BLUP scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Distributions of allele frequencies will vary between inbred and hybrid populations. As a result, inbred individuals may be relatively more common among the population of individuals with AA or BB genotypes. Alleles more common in inbred individuals relative to hybrid individuals will tend to be assigned a more negative or less positive effect value by a genomic prediction model trained with a mixed hybrid/inbred population than by a genomic prediction model trained on a purely hybrid or purely inbred population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Calculating BLUPs separately for inbred and hybrid individuals removes this source of bias in the training data by centering the distributions of both inbred and hybrid individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with earlier studies in maize, we found that inbred trait values alone were poor predictors of hybrid performance, particularly for yield e Gama and Hallauer (1977); <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Smith (1986)</xref>, although the prediction values in scheme 1 (M1), trained only on inbred data were at least statistically significantly greater than zero (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Here we found that when using a conventional additive genomic prediction model (RR-BLUP), traits with higher median heterosis (grain yield and plant height) experienced a decrease in prediction accuracy when inbred data were naively incorporated into the training dataset (M3A). Segregating BLUP means for inbreds and hybrids (M3B) statistically significantly moderately enhanced prediction accuracy for grain yield (<italic>P</italic> = 5.03e-9) and flowering time (<italic>P</italic> = 6.00e-4), compared to a scheme which excluded phenotypic data from inbred parents (M2). While statistically significant, the absolute values of the increases in prediction accuracy are moderate: flowering time (M2: 0.87, M3B: 0.87) and grain yield (M2: 0.50, M3B: 0.52). Yield was both the most difficult trait to predict, and the trait where the inclusion of inbred trait data provided the largest increase in prediction accuracy. In this study the number of inbred lines for which genotypic and phenotypic data were available was quite small. Even in scheme 3B, inbred lines made up less than 15% of the training dataset. Given that extensive inbred trait datasets exist for pearl millet, it may be that the incorporation of genotypic and phenotypic data from larger numbers of inbred lines would produce a larger absolute increase in prediction accuracy. As inbred lines must be grown prior to the production of hybrid seed, the collection of trait data from these lines comes at relatively low cost, and may have additional value when integrated into training datasets which also include genotypic and phenotypic data from a sample of hybrid lines.</p><p>Even small numbers of selected SNPs can achieve relatively high prediction accuracy in this pearl millet population. The implementation of a hybrid GS/GP guided pearl millet breeding program has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of breeding efforts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, it must be noted that in our training set the high representation of haplotypes drawn from 33 common parental lines produces close relationships between sub-sampled training and testing populations, and this could also be a reason to explain why a smaller number set of SNPs can reach plateaus in accuracy for genomic prediction of some studied traits. As a result, our estimates of model prediction accuracy are likely inflated relative to predictions on unrelated populations <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Isidro <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref>. To expand the applicability of this genomic prediction model to a wider pearl millet genomic selection assisted breeding program, it will be necessary to incorporate data from a hybrids derived from a broader genetic basis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by an CGIAR-US Universities Linkage Program on Dryland Cereals (404-40-89) to PSS, JCS, SKG and RKS.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Supplemental material available at Figshare: doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5969230">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5969230</ext-link>; doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5566843">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5566843</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Communicating editor: A.
