    "The aim of this study was to compare the quality and physicochemical characteristics of blue-shelled eggs (BE) and conventional eggs (CE). Proximate composition, quality, pH value, shell color, collagen content, fatty acid composition, total cholesterol, α-glucosidase inhibition activity, and antioxidation activity were determined. The proximate composition, general qualities, and pH values of CE and BE showed no significant differences, except in moisture composition, weight, and shell thickness. Moisture content and weight of BE were significantly lower than those of CE. However, shell thickness and weight of BE were higher than those of CE (p<0.05). Lightness of BE was significantly higher than that of CE (85.20 vs. 58.80), while redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) of BE were lower than those of CE (a*: -4.75 vs. 14.20; b*: 10.45 vs. 30.63). The fatty acid [C18:1n7 (cis-vaccenic acid) and C18:3n6 (gamma-linolenic acid)] contents of BE were significantly higher than those of CE. The total cholesterol contents of BE and CE were similar. DPPH radical scavenging activity of BE was significantly higher than that of CE (40.78 vs. 35.35). Interestingly, α-glucosidase inhibition activity of whole egg and egg yolk in BE (19.27 and 36.06) was significantly higher than that of whole egg and egg yolk in CE (13.95 and 32.46). This result indicated that BE could potentially be used as a functional food material. Further studies are required to evaluate the specific compounds that affect functional activity."
