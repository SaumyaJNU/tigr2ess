One potential reason could be the discordance between lay and medical explanatory models of hypertension and its treatment. Understanding community perceptions and practices may contribute to improving hypertension control as they present insights into psychosocial and cultural factors that shape individual behaviour. We explore community perceptions regarding hypertension and its treatment in rural northern Ghana and how they differ from medical understanding.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to collect data, which were analysed using a thematic approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>A multisite study conducted in four rural communities in two regions of northern Ghana.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews and eight focus group discussions with community leaders and members, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three major themes were identified: community perceptions, treatment options and community support for people with hypertension. Community perceptions about hypertension include hypertension perceived as excess blood in the body and associated with spiritual or witchcraft attacks. Traditional medicine is perceived to cure hypertension completely with concurrent use of biomedical and traditional medicines encouraged in rural communities. Community members did not consider themselves at risk of developing hypertension and reported having inadequate information on how to provide social support for hypertensive community members, which they attributed to low literacy and poverty.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is a substantial mismatch between communities&#x02019; perceptions and medical understanding of hypertension and its treatment. These perceptions partly result from structural factors and social norms shaped by collective processes and traditions that shape lay beliefs and influence individual health behaviour. Socioeconomic factors also thwart access to information and contribute to inadequate social support for persons with hypertension. These findings highlight the need for a public health approach to hypertension control targeting families and communities.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension control</kwd><kwd>rural community health beliefs and practices</kwd><kwd>traditional and alternative treatment for hypertension</kwd><kwd>Ghana, Africa</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study represents the first of its kind in Ghana to explore, in&#x000a0;depth, community explanatory models regarding hypertension and its treatment in rural northern Ghana.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study collected data from a limited set of participants in four purposively sampled communities in northern Ghana in two local languages that may not reflect the views of other communities or ethnic groups in northern Ghana.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study did not have an equal representation of male and female community leaders in the semi-structured interviews and as such may not present a comprehensive overview of female community leaders insights on the topic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study focused specifically on community members who had some general and/or in-depth experience with persons with hypertension and thus allowed us to identify community perceptions about hypertension and its treatment options, explore the processes that contribute to shaping these perceptions surrounding hypertension and how they differ from current medical knowledge.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To ensure that the results were representative, we used the semi-structured interviews with community leaders to triangulate and explore in-depth the data that were collected in the&#x000a0;focus group discussions.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and is frequently comorbid with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It rarely causes any symptoms, but it is an indicator for needed behavioural changes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Evidence shows that adherence to HTN treatment improves control and reduces CVD risk.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> However, HTN treatment and control remain a difficult public health problem despite increased HTN prevalence particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 7 8</xref> A possible explanation could be the difference between people&#x02019;s lay beliefs and medical understanding of HTN. Identifying people&#x02019;s lay beliefs surrounding HTN and understanding the underlying factors that shape such beliefs is therefore crucial to understanding the norms and factors that influence individuals&#x02019; actions towards HTN control. This is vital for improving HTN control and preventing HTN-related complications particularly in rural communities and communities with low socioeconomic status. Studies have shown that such communities are more vulnerable to NCDs and are further entrenched into poverty because of the exorbitant costs associated with seeking healthcare for chronic diseases.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p><p>Kleinman in his lay explanatory models (EMs) proposes that there can be different notions of health and diseases by different groups of people. He argues that people&#x02019;s understanding of their illness often differ from biomedical understanding of diseases, and these differences could affect treatment outcomes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Kleinman identifies the definition of the illness, its perceived causes, symptoms, duration, severity, expected consequences, appropriate treatment and anticipated outcomes as the eight key pillars of a comprehensive EM.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Several studies have shown that patient&#x02019;s EMs differ from biomedical EMs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12&#x02013;14</xref> In particular, studies in the USA and UK have stressed that traditional and cultural beliefs and practices have an influence on perceptions regarding HTN among people of African descent. In SSA, a study, conducted in Zambia&#x000a0;among adult rural participants reported a preference for using alternative medicines and herbs for BP treatment,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> while another study in Nigeria found that while social support could contribute to compliance to HTN treatment,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> even among people of the same ethnicity, there could be varied beliefs about HTN. These studies suggest that communities&#x02019; perceptions regarding illness influence how individuals understand and perceive their illness and could subsequently influence health outcomes for HTN and for other chronic diseases. Gaining insights into communities&#x02019; perceptions on HTN and the underlying factors shaping such perceptions could facilitate an understanding of how communities conceptualise and construct meanings for specific illnesses and treatment options, which is important for designing innovative and culturally acceptable health interventions for prevention and control of HTN and other NCDs.</p><p>In Ghana as in most SSA countries, HTN is the second most common cause of outpatient morbidity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Public health campaigns have been the main source of public awareness, but these have generated low awareness even among health workers and resulted in little behaviour change.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 17</xref> A recent study found a 22% age-standardised prevalence of HTN in rural Ghana, and 85% of study participants in rural Ghana with severe HTN were untreated.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Another study in three poor urban communities in Accra showed that, despite a 28.3% prevalence of HTN, only 7.4% were aware of their condition, 4% were on antihypertensive medicines and only 3.5% had their blood pressure (BP) adequately controlled.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This study found limited knowledge of the risk factors, poor access to medicines and healthcare and poor medication adherence as key reasons for the poor control of HTN.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is unclear if these reasons for the poor control in urban Ghana are applicable in rural Ghana and the extent to which community perceptions and practices could explain patient behaviour and practices towards HTN treatment and control.</p><p>Most research studies on HTN have been conducted in urban Ghana among people with HTN and health professionals and have used mainly quantitative tools.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 19&#x02013;22</xref> To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored community perceptions regarding HTN in the rural and lower socioeconomic communities of northern Ghana using a qualitative approach. HTN is regularly among the top five causes of morbidity in northern Ghana with a study reporting a 19.3% high BP prevalence in a rural community in northern Ghana.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Northern Ghana is largely rural has the lowest literacy rates, high levels of poverty, malnutrition, high burden of infectious diseases, limited access to healthcare services and acute shortages of health professionals.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;27</xref> Cultural and traditional activities also affect social determinants of health such as education and household decision-making power with some cultural practices deeply rooted in age-long spiritual beliefs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This blend of structural and cultural factors contribute to shaping community members&#x02019; understanding and conceptualisation of HTN and treatment options and influence health behaviour and practices. Indeed, previous studies conducted in northern Ghana show that community perceptions and practices differ from biomedical explanations for childhood illness<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and childhood mortality<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and for infectious diseases such as malaria<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and filariasis,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x000a0;yet scant evidence exists on if community perceptions and practices for HTN differ from biomedical practices and the factors that contribute to shaping such perceptions and practices towards HTN. Janzen identifies this group of people, that is, family and community members in African societies, as the &#x02018;therapy managing group&#x02019; who take responsibility during illness by playing a &#x02018;brokerage function&#x02019; between the patient and the specialist.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Because community and family members live, work with and serve as the &#x02018;therapy managing group&#x02019;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> for people with HTN, particularly in rural African communities, they play key roles in influencing individual health behaviour and practices towards HTN treatment and control. Using semistructured interviews and focus group discussions&#x000a0;(FGDs) with non-hypertensive community members and leaders, we explored communities&#x02019; casual theories of HTN, its treatment options and social support for people with HTN to understand how they could influence treatment and control of HTN in rural Ghana. We further explored underlying factors shaping communities&#x02019; lay beliefs and identify commonalities and differences between lay perceptions and biomedical models for HTN using Kleinman&#x02019;s concept.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>Northern Ghana is made up of three administrative regions of Ghana (Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions) that are predominantly rural and agrarian with widely dispersed settlements.

We further explored the sociocultural realities and structural factors that influence how communities experience and construct meaning for HTN. The study design, data collection, analysis and reporting were conducted in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research as shown in&#x000a0;online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>. We collected cross-sectional qualitative data from a total of 96 non-hypertensive community members and leaders in four communities using semi-structured interviews and FGDs between March and June 2017. We used FGDs with community members to gain broader insights and understanding of communities&#x02019; social views regarding causes of HTN, treatment options and the role of social support in HTN management. We further explored these themes in depth and explored the generalisability of these perceptions as expressed in the FGDs using semistructured interviews with community leaders. We sought written,&#x000a0;thumbprinted and verbal consent from each participant prior to collecting data in the form of digitally recorded audio files. The research team had no prior contact with study participants.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023451.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p>

</p></supplementary-material><sec id="s2c1"><title>FGDs with community members</title><p>In each of the two regions, we conducted four FGDs with non-hypertensive community members in the regional capital and in a district town where patients access healthcare for HTN. Eight to 11 community members recruited in collaboration with a key informant (usually, the assemblyman) constituted each FGD. FGDs were grouped by sex because previous research suggests that due to the sociocultural context, women may not actively participate in discussions in the presence of men.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Participants were recruited if they had lived within the community for at least 5&#x02009;years, had not been previously diagnosed as hypertensive and knew someone diagnosed with HTN within their social network. Participants were invited by the assembly member in the company of the first author. Participants received both an information sheet and verbal information about the purpose of the research from the first author. Participants met at a community meeting point on a given day at a scheduled time. We invited 12 community members for each FGD with discussions starting with a minimum of six members and others joining in as the discussions progressed. Standard guidelines for conducting FGDs indicate that groups should consist of 6&#x02013;10 participants<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> because groups of more than eight are difficult to control.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Since the first author had personally met and provided study information to invited participants, she identified and engaged late-coming participants to join the discussions. Digital recording was paused when late-coming participants arrived in order to allow for introductions and discussions resumed. Since participants already knew each other, the first author did not observe any difficulties for latecomers joining the discussion. At least one invited community member did not attend the discussions at the scheduled time for unknown reasons. Discussion time ranged between 40 minutes&#x000a0;and 76&#x02009;minutes. Trained research assistants (RAs) with at least 2&#x02009;years&#x02019; experience collecting qualitative data moderated the discussions in the local languages (Dagbani and Gurune) in each region using a topic guide developed by the authors based on HTN and NCD literature in Africa and their research experience. The first author, who understands the local languages, observed all the discussions and participated by probing or following up on responses that required clarification or further explanation and taking notes. The first author, who has extensive experience collecting and analysing qualitative data, politely excused any curious bystanders during the discussions to ensure privacy in line with standard guidelines for conducting FGDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Semi-structured interviews with community leaders</title><p>We identified and invited eight active community leaders in collaboration with senior staff health professionals at the regional and district health centres for semi-structured interviews in each region. Senior health professionals contacted community leaders via phone, and on the agreed dates, the first author together with a senior health professional met each community leader for introductions and to schedule date and time for the interview. Participants received both an information sheet and verbal information about the study, and interviews were conducted at their homes. No identified leader refused to participate in the study. We tried to involve as many female community leaders as possible, but we could only reach two female leaders in the districts we selected in the NR and one female leader in UER because most of the active community leaders were male. Selected community leaders included subchiefs, <italic>magagyas</italic> (female leaders of community women) and assembly members. Trained RAs conducted the interviews in the local languages using a topic guide developed by the authors with interview time ranging from 30&#x000a0;minutes to 65&#x02009;minutes per interview in the presence of the first author. In cases where community leaders could speak English, the first author conducted the interviews personally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted after all interviews had been conducted, transcribed and quality checked. Two RAs who are natives of the regions transcribed the interviews verbatim from the local languages directly into English. The first author reviewed all transcripts. Because majority of study participants could not read and/nor write in English or the local language, transcripts were not returned to participants for cross-checking.</p><p>Using a thematic approach to data analysis, the coding framework generated by the first author involved initial preidentified codes derived from previous literature on HTN, diabetes and chronic disease in Ghana.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13 22 39</xref> Open-ended inductive codes were also generated based on&#x000a0;the practical research experience of the authors and the socioeconomic and cultural contexts of the study area.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25 27</xref> Codes were reviewed with coauthors and active data coding of transcripts began. The first author reviewed, coded and analysed all transcripts in constant comparison in QRS NVivo 11 pro. Emphasis was placed on how sociocultural and structural factors shaped communities&#x02019;&#x000a0;EMs regarding HTN and its treatment and the practicalities of providing social support for persons with HTN. We explored in depth the&#x000a0;patterns and linkages between quotes, codes, themes, existing literature and the conceptual framework to assess content and areas of convergence and divergence between lay and biomedical EMs of HTN and its management. Quotations were grouped under codes and subcodes based on identified themes.

HTN was referred to in the local language as an &#x02018;excess of blood&#x02019; in the body, related to the heart or chest or due to irregularities in the flow of blood to the body. In NR, HTN is referred to as <italic>Zhiduli</italic> or <italic>Ziemdoro</italic> (blood is gone high or blood sickness) or <italic>Nyomugli</italic> (chest problems), while in the UER, HTN is described as <italic>Sunsua ba</italic> (heart or anger sickness), <italic>Zeemzore ba-a</italic> or <italic>Zeemdoyah ba-a</italic> (blood is plenty or blood is high sickness) and <italic>Susu folgre</italic> (heart burns). Community members elaborated that this was how HTN was described to them in the local languages by health professionals. This was confirmed in the interviews with community leaders. Some community members in UER held the view that HTN was communicable though contact with the body fluids such as saliva of a person with HTN. Dizziness, headaches, body pains, blurred vision and body weakness were perceived to be signs of HTN.</p><disp-quote><p>[Z]eemzore ba-a [blood is plenty]&#x02026;that is what they [health workers] say.

IDI-NR-CL-M-06</p></disp-quote><p>In UER especially, persons with HTN were perceived by community members as <italic>sicklers</italic> (people who frequently get sick) or regarded as alcoholics. Some community members also perceived HTN as witchcraft and/or spiritual attacks. This was substantiated by community leaders who explained that these beliefs resulted from persons with HTN suddenly falling sick, always been sick and/or weak and/or arouse from the unexpected deaths of people who developed HTN. Unexpected deaths of persons with HTN were often attributed to them having sought biomedical treatments requiring <italic>injections</italic>. HTN was therefore perceived as &#x02018;<italic>not a hospital disease</italic>&#x02019; (not treatable biomedical).</p><disp-quote><p>Some too say the sunsua ba is not a hospital sickness and if they go and they [health workers] inject them, they will die&#x02026; they are just sicklers or they have sickness in their bodies.

Community leaders attributed the lack of information on HTN to community members&#x02019; inability to read in English or in the local languages that they explained, limits their access to information on HTN. Community members explained that their main sources of information on HTN were through television, radio and information vans. Other sources of information mentioned by community leaders but not by members were occasional free health screening exercises organised by churches and non-governmental organisations.</p><disp-quote><p>We actually don&#x02019;t know much about this disease and what it can do&#x02026; I have heard people died suddenly of too much blood in their body&#x02026; So, the deaths of people and on the radio that I hear information about that too much blood in the body.

They explained that while the use of local spices like <italic>dawadawa</italic> (fermented African locust beans) perceived as healthier had been neglected, foreign spices containing chemicals regarded as unhealthy are mainly used in food preparation nowadays. The use of chemicals in growing and preserving food crops, the consumption of unhealthy food, snuff (a smokeless tobacco) and <italic>kolanuts</italic> (a local caffeine-containing fruit) were all perceived as causing HTN. Excessive alcohol intake especially of the locally brewed alcoholic drinks and products such as <italic>pito</italic> (alcoholic beverage made from fermented millet or sorghum), <italic>Adonko bitters</italic> and <italic>Akpeteshie</italic> (alcoholic beverage and spirits) were perceived by participants as causes of HTN. Chewing kolanuts and sniffing snuff was reportedly commonly consumed and perceived by community members to cause HTN, but this was not mentioned by community leaders.</p><disp-quote><p>[N]ot eating the food we are supposed to be eating and engaging in hard work more than our strength and the heat [weather].&#x000a0;[T]hey also want salty and sugary foods which is the cause of the sickness now&#x02026; nowadays they use magi in cooking and the different types of magi is what is causing the sickness plenty now&#x02026; they don&#x02019;t allow the magi to boil well when cooking.

Community members recounted stories where community members developed HTN due to the unexpected death of a child, friend or relative or from receiving bad news. Poverty, which community members considered&#x000a0;as pervasive in their communities and the experience of traumatic events were explained to cause stress, excessive worrying or overthinking and anguish which led to the development of HTN. This was confirmed by community leaders. Other less commonly perceived causes of HTN reported by community members but not by community leaders included dirt, smoking, excessive hard work and the hot weather. In NR particularly, members added that health workers often attributed HTN with tensions within their polygamous families.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02026;&#x000a0;if you become too frightened that also can lead to Zhiduli&#x02026; something bad happens to you, it can bring about the Zhimdoro&#x02026; we heard one of us passed on [died] and it was that her baby died mysteriously.

Community members recounted that when they were younger (10&#x02013;15&#x02009;years ago), HTN was perceived to be an illness that attacked the rich and affluent but currently, HTN attacks any person regardless of socioeconomic status. Community members attributed the increasing prevalence to changes in diet and overthinking about increasing costs of living, and fewer economic opportunities that caused stress and excessive thinking. They further explained that in the past, they could farm and had fewer needs, but currently due to modernisation and urbanisation, most people had lost their farmlands and jobs and had more needs such as school fees for children and medical bills to pay that caused them be stressed.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; if you look at first [past] and now, people used not to think a lot like now; where any young person would start thinking about how to acquire property, school fees and work and this is what is causing the disease now more than the past&#x02026; it was not like that when we were young. if you look at those days [past], families used to cook with dawadawa, but nowadays they use magi in cooking and the different magi is what is causing the diseases now&#x02026; FGD-UER-CM-M-01</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x02026;&#x000a0;the zeemzore ba is as a result of the numerous problems we have nowadays.

FGD-UER-CM-M-03</p></disp-quote><p>Community members held the view that non-adherence to antihypertensive medication was due to reasons such as poverty and inability to pay for medicines, inability to swallow, the belief that traditional medicine can cure HTN and the perception that taking antihypertensive medicines over a long period can lead to the development of other diseases. Side effects of medication such as sexual and body weakness were also mentioned by community members and leaders in NR as key reasons for male non-adherence to medication. Distrust in antihypertensive medication and the feeling that HTN was controlled were key reasons for none adherence to medication mentioned by community members and leaders in UER.</p><disp-quote><p>[S]ome people take the medicine and when they are better they will stop&#x02026;&#x000a0;some too they will be taking the medicine and when they hear that this or that traditional medicine cures it like they always hear in the radio or at the market, they will stop the hospital medicine and do the traditional treatment&#x02026;&#x000a0;my sister, this sickness is not a hospital diseases so you take the medicine small and stop and do your traditional medicine and the sickness will be finished&#x02026; You cannot be taking medicine till you die&#x02026; I hear if you take it [antihypertensive] too long, you will get another sickness&#x02026; But this sickness too err, why will you be taking medicine like that all the time?

They elaborated that <italic>dawadawa</italic> could be eaten as a cooked meal, grounded and mixed as pomade for the body or mixed with water for drinking or for bathing as part of traditional medicines for curing HTN. Community members explained that the traditional healer identifies and provides the herbs, barks or roots that are then prepared and ground into flour that is mixed with oil and rubbed on the body of the person or mixed with water for bathing. Treatment continues until the herbalist or healer says HTN was cured. Community leaders confirmed this and added that access to and payment for treatment involved the provision of a new calabash and fowls determined by the sex of the patient, that is, three and four fowls for male and female, respectively.

They held the belief that concurrent use could also cure HTN and reported that health professionals did not discourage them from concurrent use. Members elaborated that antihypertensive medicines were effective at providing quick relief from perceived HTN related symptoms, while traditional treatments were perceived as the most effective treatment for completely curing HTN. HTN was particularly completely curable if traditional medicine was used prior to getting <italic>injections</italic> (biomedical treatment) or if HTN&#x000a0;was not &#x02018;severe&#x02019; (had not progressed to stroke or hospitalisation). Chewing kolanuts were also reportedly commonly used in managing HTN when using antihypertensive medication and/or traditional medicine. Community leaders confirmed these perceptions and explained that community members often sought biomedical care first to diagnose HTN prior to seeking traditional medicine for cure.

They also explained that social support was poor because some community and family members get frustrated with the inability of some persons with HTN to comply with behavioural changes such as reducing their consumption of alcohol and/or engaged in surreptitious use of salt. Community members also indicated that the relationships between a person with HTN and other family and community members also determined the level and kind of social support that persons with HTN received. As such, members with HTN who were reportedly active and/or had good relations with community and family received social support in the form of financial donations, social visits and encouragement. Other key barriers to proving social support for persons with HTN that community members mentioned included poverty and working demands of family members, which made it difficult to encourage adherence to dietary recommendations, provide transport costs and assist persons with HTN to attend the health facilities for routine health monitoring and refill of medicines.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02026; one will get up in the morning and instead of cooking good food for the person to reduce the blood, they will just rush to work and may be come back in the evening and now prepare food for the person&#x02026;if the patient is advised not to do certain things like the drink and the person is still does, it becomes very annoying to the people who help him and so they will leave him completely to do what he wants&#x02026; it depends on how the person relates with his friends or the members of the church and the others, that may be prevent them from supporting him.

It explores the broader sociocultural and structural factors that influence patient behaviour and practices particularly in rural areas. While participants had similar EMs, there are differences between community EMs and medical EMs (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). The results suggest that sociocultural norms, economic factors and prevailing healthcare options have a strong influence on how communities&#x02019; conceptualise and construct meanings for HTN. They also show how collective processes and structural factors shape sociocultural norms and unravel how these norms influence communities&#x02019; health-seeking behaviour and influence the choice and utilisation of treatment options for HTN at the community and individual levels. These findings provide key evidence that highlight the need for a public health approach to HTN control in order to make sustained gains in treatment and control. We use the findings presented in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> to guide the discussions in the subheadings, comparison with previous literature and the implications for clinical practice, policy and future research.</p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Community perspectives versus medical perspectives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Explanatory model</td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Main perceptions of community members and leaders</td><td valign="bottom" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical perspective</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Definition</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excess of blood.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">How much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats and/or when the heart is resting between beats.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Causes</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mainly psychological, social and economic.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mainly behavioural and genetic.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Presentation</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Symptomatic (headaches&#x000a0;and dizziness).</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asymptomatic.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Appropriate&#x000a0;treatment</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Traditional medicine.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adherence to antihypertensive medication and behavioural medication.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anticipated outcome of treatment</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cure.</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Management.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Risk of developing hypertension (HTN) if relative is living with HTN</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No recognition of own risk of developing HTN.

Given that many community members cannot read or write in English or in the local languages, access to health information is mainly through&#x000a0;spoken local language via contact with health workers and through radio and television programmes conducted in the local languages. For example, the perception that HTN is &#x02018;excess blood&#x02019; is facilitated partly by how HTN is translated by health professionals to community members into the local languages. Findings from our earlier study in northern Ghana show that health professionals held the opinion that because of translation difficulties, their translation of HTN into the local languages may have contributed to the perception that HTN is &#x02018;excess of blood (Nyaaba, unpublished). Health professionals therefore need to address this translation difficulty and provide succinct public education in the communities to enhance communities understanding of HTN and its causes in order to counter this perception.</p><p>In addition, while biomedical care is sought for diagnosing and providing quick relief from pain and perceived HTN related symptoms, there appears to be a psychosocial inclination towards seeking traditional and alternative treatments that promise a complete cure for HTN. Various studies have suggested that healer shopping is a prevailing response for both communicable and NCDs in southern and northern Ghana<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 43 44</xref> and in other African countries.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 44&#x02013;46</xref> A recent study on healer shopping for diabetes in southern Ghana found that despite a preference for biomedical medication, the psychosocial and socioeconomic impacts of diabetes promote a cure seeking behaviour in patients with diabetes and medical inaction that potentially aggravate complications of diabetes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Another study conducted in Zambia also found a preference for traditional and alternative treatment for HTN among rural community members.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> While perceived symptoms of HTN could potentially discourage adherence to antihypertensive medication based on their absence, non-adherence to antihypertensive medication as explored within our study was reportedly due to reasons such as side effects, denial of condition and limited access to medication, which are similar to findings of other studies on HTN and other chronic diseases conducted among Ghanaians.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 12 22 47</xref> Another barrier to medication adherence and subsequently HTN control is the fear that taking antihypertensive medication for a long period can lead to the development of other diseases. Health interventions therefore need to take these perceptions into consideration in designing innovative health literacy programmes that effectively dispel these beliefs to improve health behavioural practices towards effective HTN control.</p><p>Furthermore, the perception that HTN is not a <italic>hospital disease</italic> differs considerably from the medical EMs of HTN,&#x000a0;which considers HTN as a chronic condition best treated with adherence to antihypertensive medication and behaviour modification. This perception facilitates and is facilitated by the perception that HTN is curable using traditional treatment if traditional treatment is sought prior to biomedical care. These perceptions possibly motivate the concurrent use of traditional medicines and antihypertensive medicines that can potentially lead to uncontrolled HTN and its related complications. It also appears that while there are concerns on interactions arising from concurrent use of antihypertensive medication and traditional medicines, these concerns appear averted by using the different treatments at different times of a day or periods. These perceptions are enabled by the numerous herbal medicines that promise cure for HTN and other chronic conditions advertised via television, radio and information vans, which are the main sources of information in these rural communities.</p><p>It also appears that while there is a common recognition from our study that social support could contribute to improve compliance to dietary regimes and medication adherence, there are socioeconomic and other structural barriers that impede family and community members&#x02019; ability to adequately support people with HTN. Studies have shown that social support contributes significantly to improving health outcomes.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The results show that sociocultural and economic factors hinder social support&#x000a0;and a person&#x02019;s own social relations with family and/or community members determine, to an extent, the social support that he or she receives. Persons with HTN therefore have to manage these sociocultural dynamics within their families and communities to enable them receive social support for their condition. In addition, despite implementing dietary changes such as reduction in salt intake or consumption of fatty foods for a relative with HTN, these are specifically for the hypertensive relative and not for non-hypertensive family members as they did not recognise their own risk of developing HTN. Similar findings were made in a study conducted in southern Ghana where despite individuals&#x02019; awareness of HTN, individuals did not consider themselves at risk of developing HTN.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The situation is worsened by the fact that high levels of illiteracy and poverty hinder community and family members&#x02019; access to information on HTN. Family members could potentially play a big role in HTN control by ensuring adherence to medication and creating a conducive environment for persons with HTN if they empowered with information.</p><p>Lastly, the findings suggest that structural factors such as difficulties in communication, poverty and inadequate access to information are recognised by community members as key factors that hinder their ability to manage HTN. Together with high illiteracy rates recorded in such rural settings, these structural factors hinder communities&#x02019; and patients&#x02019; understanding of the causes of HTN and indeed other chronic conditions&#x000a0;and also hinder effective control efforts as they contribute to perpetuate perceptions regarding treatment and how to manage such chronic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for clinical practice, policy and future research</title><p>The findings have several important implications for HTN control. First, marked differences exist between communities&#x02019; EMs and medical EMs of HTN and its treatment that could influence patients&#x02019; behavioural practices and potentially contribute to the poor control of HTN. It is apparent that these perceptions are influenced and shaped by sociocultural norms, economic factors such as education and literacy and health worker challenges in communication. As these structural and cultural factors influence how communities understand and conceptualise HTN and construct their EMs regarding HTN and its treatment, they present key obstacles to improving HTN treatment and control. For example, while the perception that HTN is excess blood could lead to the avoidance of protein-rich diets in a bid to reduce blood and causing anaemia and malnutrition, the perception that persons with HTN are &#x02018;sicklers&#x02019; or alcoholics could lead to stigma and poor social support for such persons and subsequently affect HTN control. Clinicians and health policy makers, therefore, need to understand and consider how communities develop these perceptions in designing social and culturally acceptable public health campaigns and interventions to provide succinct public education to dispel these perceptions and contribute to HTN control particularly in rural communities.</p><p>The fear that taking antihypertensive medicines for long periods can lead to the development of other diseases deserves attention as it differs from the medical model. If this is not addressed, it could lead to uncontrolled HTN and the development of HTN-related complications because HTN is a risk factor for CVDs. The impacts and consequences of uncontrolled HTN on individuals, communities and the health system would be worsened. Clinicians and policymakers therefore need to design innovative health literacy programmes that effectively counter these beliefs and improve adherence to medication.</p><p>Furthermore, the finding that the use of local stimulants such as the chewing of specific types of kolanuts can manage HTN is significantly important as chewing kolanuts is considered a sign of ageing, woven into the sociocultural fabric of most rural communities in northern Ghana and thus persons with HTN who chew kola may be less adherent to medication because they believe they are already managing their condition by chewing kolanuts. While this has received little attention in current HTN literature, further evidence is needed to explore if patients hold this perception&#x000a0;and practice it and how it contributes to HTN control.</p><p>Importantly, the perception that traditional medicine can completely cure HTN and the herbal medicines that promise cure for HTN deserves attention as it contributes to the poor control of HTN and the growing NCD burden in the country. It epitomises the low focus on NCDs in healthcare systems in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and calls for the significant structural and policy reforms to address the increasing NCD prevalence and poor control particularly for HTN. While the Traditional and Alternative Medicines&#x000a0;(TAM) unit&#x000a0;was established by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to provide herbal medical care and regulate herbal and alternative medicines in Ghana, it appears that the TAM unit needs to put more efforts into identifying and regulating herbal medicine advertisements and use. Such advertisements of herbal medicines promising cures for HTN and related sequelae in the media space and in the market areas need to be carefully monitored and regulated. Effective collaboration with the National Media Commission and its media houses could potentially contribute to regulating these adverts in the media space and contribute to improving community perceptions surrounding HTN and its treatment.</p><p>Moreover, the finding that concurrent use of antihypertensive medication and traditional remedies and medicines is encouraged and could cure HTN deserves attention. While further research is needed to identify the specific implications of concurrent use of these treatments, it could possibly aggravate HTN and its related complications. This, coupled with the perception that HTN can be cured using traditional medicines if sought prior to biomedical care, presents serious obstacles to effective HTN control as they facilitate delays in seeking healthcare for early diagnosis and&#x000a0;could affect adherence to medication and dietary changes. These deserve urgent health policy attention particularly as they have received little attention in current HTN literature.</p><p>In addition, the finding that community members do not recognise their own risk of developing HTN even when a relative is hypertensive warrants attention as it is precisely because a relative has HTN that family members need to be vigilant about risk and adapt major behavioural changes due to shared risk factors. For instance, while it sounds practical that food for a relative with HTN be separated prior to adding salt to the food for other family members, it is important that all family members reduce their intake of salt in order to reduce their risk of HTN. A public health approach to HTN control is therefore needed, which should include empowering communities with health information about HTN including the benefits of implementing dietary and other behavioural changes for the entire family. It should also empower communities on how they can support members with HTN while promoting healthy living. Particularly in rural areas where social and cultural structures are traditionally defined, community members and leaders and family members are major influencers for health-seeking behaviour and adherence and should therefore be involved in the design and implementation of public health campaigns and patient care and self-management interventions.</p><p>Finally, these perceptions could potentially arise from and are fuelled by socioeconomic factors such as poverty, limited access to health healthcare and low literacy that predominate in such rural settings and influence health-seeking behaviour. It is evident that these perceptions regarding causes, treatment and social support for HTN are embedded in structural conditions that, together with poor communication, poverty and inadequate access to health information regarding HTN are key underlying causes of these perceptions. The situation is further compounded by cultural factors that facilitate these perceptions and hinder effective control of HTN in such communities. These findings highlight the critical need for a holistic public health approach to HTN control that addresses the fundamental underlying causes of these perceptions while empowering individuals and communities with the needed information in ways that they can understand and use in order to effectively improve HTN control and promote healthy living.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>With regards to limitations, the study collected data from four communities purposively sampled in northern Ghana, which may not reflect the views of other communities or ethnic groups in northern Ghana. To ensure that the results were representative we conducted the study in the main communities at the health system level where HTN care is provided and also used semistructured interviews with community leaders to triangulate and explore in depth the data that was collected in the FGDs. Second, while it would have been ideal to have an equal representation of male and female community leaders in the semistructured interviews, this was not possible due to the limited number of actively involved female community leaders who met our selection criteria.</p><p>The main strength of this study is that it collected data from community members who had some general and/or in-depth experience with a person with HTN and thus allowed us to identify community perceptions about HTN and its treatment options, explore the processes and factors that shape these perceptions surrounding HTN and how they differ from current medical knowledge. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study that seeks to provide lay community perceptions surrounding HTN and its treatment in rural northern Ghana. This is crucial to informing the design and implementation of health interventions to improve HTN control and prevent related sequelae and&#x000a0;could be applicable to other NCDs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings provide key evidence that underline the need for a public health approach that targets individuals with HTN and health professionals, communities and family members in a bid to improve HTN control and potentially encourage healthy living. Given high levels of poverty and low literacy rates in rural communities in LMICs, there is a need for designing and implementing targeted integrated interventions at various levels (individual, family, community, regional and national levels) with the aim of increasing awareness on HTN and its related complications, promoting healthy living and encouraging social support for people with HTN. Health policy needs to take into consideration these sociocultural and economic peculiarities within differing geographical contexts in adapting and implementing national strategies aimed at reducing the increasing NCD burden and particularly improve HTN control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e215" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-023451.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-023451.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate Program of the European Union supports this work though the Amsterdam Institute of Global Health and Development as part of GNN&#x02019;s PhD candidacy at the Academic Medical Centre/University of Amsterdam.
