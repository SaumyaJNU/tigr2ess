In the United States, the National Council for Behavioral Health coordinates nearly 2000 CBHOs, which serve approximately 6 million adults and children with mental illness and addiction disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The fundamental goal of each CBHO is to improve the health and well-being of its community by delivering effective, accessible mental and behavioral health services. As the interface between primary care and mental health treatment, CBHOs play an essential role in the management and care of patients with mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is complex and challenging to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and behavior, and social withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], schizophrenia affects only about 1% of the US population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but it causes substantial financial burden, especially if not well controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Since schizophrenia influences virtually all aspects of an individual&#x02019;s life, it is important that clinicians and patients take a holistic approach when developing a treatment plan. Successful treatment must not only reduce or eliminate symptoms, but also maximize quality of life and social functioning and promote and maintain recovery. Treatment for schizophrenia typically requires a multidisciplinary approach that provides both psychopharmacology and psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for patients with schizophrenia, but adherence to medication is often poor; this compromises outcomes and increases health care resource utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Newer treatment innovations, such as atypical long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medications, have been effective in addressing poor adherence. By delivering therapeutic concentrations of medication continuously over the course of several days or weeks, LAI therapies eliminate the need for daily medication administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and assure clinicians of patient adherence. Two such LAI antipsychotic therapies (APTs)&#x02014;risperidone LAI (RLAI), an atypical APT administered once every 2&#x000a0;weeks for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and paliperidone palmitate LAI (PP LAI), an atypical LAI APT administered once per month for the acute and maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]&#x02014;have demonstrated improved adherence and efficacy, as well as reduced relapse rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Historically, LAI APTs were reserved for patients with poor adherence and those who had failed other APTs (who typically have a longer history of disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although current clinical guidelines for patients with schizophrenia do not provide clear recommendations for LAI APT use, there is growing support for its use in first-episode psychosis, patients with frequent relapses, and those who prefer injectable over oral medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite the demonstrated therapeutic benefits of LAI APTs, they are prescribed at substantially lower rates in the United States (~8%) than elsewhere in the world (22%&#x02013;36% in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Hong Kong, and Australia, for example) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, and it underscores the need for a better understanding of how patients with schizophrenia in the United States are treated and managed.</p><p id="Par24">Outpatient facilities, such as CBHOs, play a critical role in the care of patients with serious mental illness, but there is a paucity of patient outcomes data from this health care setting. This dearth of information is unfortunate given that prospective observational studies conducted in community settings provide valuable treatment usage and outcomes data. Unlike randomized controlled trials, which have stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria that limit external validity, prospective observational studies follow less restrictive methodological standards, and consequently their results are more generalizable to &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; practice settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To date, prospective observational studies evaluating the real-world treatment of patients with mental illness have been predominantly international studies, with limited data on current LAI APT usage and APT treatment outcomes in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted the Research and Evaluation of Antipsychotic Treatment in Community Behavioral Health Organizations, Outcomes (REACH-OUT) trial, a real-world observational study of patients with mental illness treated at CBHOs across the United States. The main objectives of REACH-OUT were to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics, APT treatment patterns, and health care resource utilization of patients with schizophrenia undergoing medical care as usual. By describing the characteristics of patients receiving APT in CBHOs, REACH-OUT will generate real-world data from naturalistic outpatient settings and provide health care providers, researchers, policy makers, and other stakeholders a holistic picture of schizophrenia treatment practices in the community setting. These data could then be used to evaluate associated outcomes that support clinical decision-making, best practices, and treatment guidelines. This article describes the study design of REACH-OUT and the patient characteristics and outcomes among LAI APT and oral APT cohorts at enrollment and after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par25">The REACH-OUT study was a prospective, noninterventional, observational study of adult patients receiving their usual courses of treatment for schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in CBHO settings in the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number NCT01181960; Clinical Registry number CR017107).

At enrollment, approximately two-thirds of recruited patients were receiving LAI APT and approximately one-third of recruited patients were receiving oral APT. Overall, a number of differences in patient characteristics and outcomes were observed between patients in the LAI APT cohort and the oral APT cohort. It is noteworthy given that patients in the LAI APT cohorts were significantly younger when first diagnosed and first hospitalized compared with those in the oral APT group, suggesting that the LAI APT cohorts had a longer history of disease at enrollment.</p><p id="Par51">In the United States, the use of LAI APT is often reserved for persons with more chronic, long-standing disease and a history of poor efficacy and/or poor adherence to oral APT regimens, despite several recent studies that have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of LAI APT in patients with early illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The acceptability of prescribing LAI APT to patients with first-episode psychosis is currently the subject of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, some European countries use LAI APT in younger, recently diagnosed patients. The reasons underlying regional differences in these prescribing patterns are unknown but may reflect differences in clinical practice or market access to LAI APT.</p><p id="Par52">Real-world, observational studies play an important role in supporting the evidence base for drugs and therapies, prescribing decisions, and patient management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. To date, prospective observational studies evaluating the real-world treatment of patients with mental illness have been predominantly conducted internationally with a focus on RLAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. REACH-OUT is unique in that it was conducted in outpatient settings exclusively in the United States and encompassed several APT treatments. Data from REACH-OUT add to the body of evidence for schizophrenia management by providing outcomes data in patients treated with atypical LAI APTs (RLAI and PP LAI) and various oral APTs. Our observations generally agree with those of another US-based study: Schizophrenia Outcomes&#x02013;Utilization Relapse and Clinical Evaluation (SOURCE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Results of SOURCE&#x02014;a 24-month, multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study in patients with schizophrenia who were initiated on RLAI&#x02014;are generally comparable to our REACH-OUT findings in that LAI APT was associated with improvements in daily functioning and a decrease in hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that outcomes associated with APTs vary according to study design, with observational studies favoring depot over oral medication formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, no intervention was provided, and APT selection was at the discretion of the treating physician. APTs were not randomly assigned, and this could contribute to an imbalance in known and unknown patient characteristics between study cohorts. Second, the types of oral APTs prescribed were not recorded, and all patients prescribed an oral medication were placed in the oral APT group, precluding any analyses based on individual oral APTs. Third, to account for the recent launch of PP LAI in the US market, study enrollment was expanded for PP LAI by including patients who were on continuous PP LAI for any time period prior to enrollment. Fourth, new and continuous user groups were only established in the LAI APT group to enhance enrollment of patients using LAI APT, given the low use of LAI APTs in the US market. All comparisons were made to the oral APT group, who were considered new users by definition. Fifth, the 12-month data include only those patients who completed 12&#x000a0;months of study participation, and improvements measured by mean change from enrollment values might not be generalizable to the entire cohort. Sixth, the true baseline patient characteristics and true baseline values for study outcomes could not be collected for the continuous LAI APT users, who comprised 64.3% of the LAI APT cohort. Consequently, most of the LAI APT users might have reached maintenance treatment at study enrollment, making it challenging to detect further improvement in the outcomes 12&#x000a0;months after enrollment. It should also be noted that the distribution of LAI APT usage (63.5%) versus oral APT usage (29.8%) does not generally represent actual treatment practice or prescription patterns in the United States. Finally, because this study was restricted to patients treated at CBHO sites, the study results may not be generalizable to the entire population of patients with schizophrenia treated at other types of treatment settings (eg, correctional settings, private practices, hospitals, pharmacies). As this is a descriptive analysis, it does not account for the baseline differences that may exist due to the nature of the study design or the use of different antipsychotics used in general clinical practice for schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">The findings from this observational study suggest potential differences in the patient profiles, treatment patterns, and clinical and economic outcomes among patients with schizophrenia treated with LAI APT or oral APT at CBHOs. These results may be useful for generating hypotheses for future studies. Further comparative analysis that adjusts for nonrandom treatment assignment is needed to better evaluate the impact of treatment selection (LAI APT vs oral APT) on these patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
