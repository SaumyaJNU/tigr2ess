    "Aim:The study was conducted to evaluate eight tree leaves based on polyphenolic content and rumen in vitro incubation and gas production technique (RIVIGPT) for their nutritive potentiality. Materials and Methods:Eight selected tree leaves, namely Sesbania grandiflora, Melia dubia, Dillenia spp., Artocarpus heterophyllus, Commiphora caudata, Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala, and Acacia auriculiformis, were selected for proximate composition, forage fiber fractions, total phenolics (TPs), non-tannin phenols (NTPs), total tannins (TTs), condensed tannins (CTs), and hydrolysable tannins (HTs); RIVIGP with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG); and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) (modified in vitro two stage) analysis was conducted. On the basis of RIVIGPT, the in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) and dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated. Results:Crude protein (CP) content of tree leaves ranged from 9.59 to 25.81%, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) 28.16 to 53.33%, acid detergent fiber (ADF) 21.26 to 41.7%, acid detergent lignin (ADL) 3.62 to 21.98%, TP 1.83 to 17.35%, TT 0.40 to 15.47%, and CTs 0.02 to 15.26%. IVDMD (%) was ranged from 64.95 to 88.12. The mean metabolizable energy (ME) (MJ/Kg) of tree leaves estimated with and without PEG was 7.75±0.56 and 8.75±0.39, in vitro gas production at 24 h (IVGP24) (ml) 31.06±4.14 and 37.09±2.64, initial gas production (a) (ml) 0.49±0.63 and 1.33±0.72, potential gas production (D) (ml) 38.74±4.27 and 43.79±2.44, rate of gas production (k) (h-1) 0.11±0.02 and 0.11±0.013, t1/2 (ml) 9.81±2.41 and 7.42±0.80, in vitro gas production at 96 h IVGP96 (ml) 39.50±4.430 and 45.14±2.65, the predicted IVDOM (%) 55.44±4.15 and 61.98±3.03, and DMI (g/Kg W0.75) 103.1±14.76 and 104.3±10.16, respectively. The addition of PEG showed an improvement in IVGP24, IVGP96, ME, predicted IVDOM, and predicted DMI. CP was positively correlated with ME, IVGP24, IVGP96, a+b, k (r=0.749, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI (r=0.838, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with a and t1/2. NDF, ADF, and ADL contents were negatively correlated with ME (r=0.899, p<0.05), IVGP24 (r=-0.867, p<0.05), IVGP96 (r=-0.858, p<0.05), a+b (p<0.05), k (r=-0.828, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=-0.853, p<0.05), and DMI and positively correlated with a and t1/2 . TP, TT, and CT were negatively correlated with ME, IVGP, IVGP96, a+b, k, IVDMD, IVDOM, and DMI and positively correlated with a (r=0.808, p<0.05) and t1/2. ME (MJ/Kg) was positively correlated with IVGP24 (r=0.938, p<0.05), IVGP96 (r=0.875, p<0.05), a+b (r=0.813, p<0.05), k (r=0.731, p<0.05), IVDMD, IVDOM (r=0.985, p<0.05), and DMI (r=0.727, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with a and t1/2. Conclusion:In the present study, the potentiality of tree leaves was assessed based on CP, ADF, ADL, TP, CT, IVGP, ME, IVDMD, predicted IVDOM, and predicted DMI. Based on this, it can be concluded that S. grandiflora, M. dubia, M. Oleifera, and L. leucocephala were graded as best; A. heterophyllus and C. caudata as moderate; and Dillenia spp. and A. auriculiformis as lowest potential ruminant feed."
