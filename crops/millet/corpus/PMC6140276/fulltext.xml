Initially, we isolated 45 LAB strains. One of them showed fast growth pattern with potential probiotic and antifungal activities against<italic> Aspergillus flavus</italic> with a zone of inhibition calculated with 10, 8, 4mm for the 4th, 5th, and 6<sup>th</sup> day, respectively. Therefore, this strain (KCC-42) was chosen for microencapsulation with alginate biopolymer. It showed potential survivability in<italic> in-vitro</italic> simulated gastrointestinal fluid and radish kimchi fermentation medium. The survival rate of this free and encapsulated LAB KCC-42 was 6.85 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> and 7.48&#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, respectively; the viability count was significantly higher than nonencapsulated LAB in simulated gastrointestinal juices (acid, bile, and pancreatin) and under radish kimchi fermentation environment. Kimchi sample added with this encapsulated LAB showed increased production of organic acids compared to nonencapsulated LAB sample. Also, the organic acids such as lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and succinic acid production in fermented kimchi were measured 59mM, 26mM, 14mM, and 0.6mM of g/DW, respectively. The production of metabolites such as lactic acid, acetic acid, and succinic acid and the bacteria population was high in microencapsulated LAB samples compared with free bacteria added kimchi sample. Results of this study indicate that microencapsulated LAB KCC-42 might be a useful strategy to develop products for food and healthcare industries.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive bacteria belonging to order Lactobacillales that produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation. Therefore, LABs have been used for food fermentations because lactic acid can inhibit the growth of spoilage agents. Some LABs have been used as probiotics. Functional and safety profiles of probiotics have been measured by various biochemical parameters such as antibiotic susceptibility, adhesion of intestinal mucosa, digestion and detoxification, production of bioactive metabolites, and the potential survivability of stomach and bile acids [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At present, LAB are considered as the normal populace of the GIT (gastrointestinal tract). Therefore, LAB strains are preferably used as probiotics in human and animal foods. Many potential probiotics strains are being used as new frontiers in medicine for human healthcare and livestock industries. FDA has approved different probiotics products. They are available in commodity and commercial markets as foodstuff and ingredients. Most probiotics strains are LAB and bacteria belonging to the genus<italic> Bifidobacterium</italic>. Among various LABs, those belonging to genus<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> represent major uses in food and agricultural industries. Also, LAB strains can produce antimicrobial compounds such as organic acids, fatty acids, peptides, and bacteriocins in fermented food products [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Microencapsulation is a packaging technology for solid, liquid, and/or gaseous substance using thin polymeric materials to form small particles called microcapsules. These microcapsules might be broken by different external stimuli such as diffusion, heat, and pressure in the digestive tract, thus releasing active ingredients at the active site in the digestive tract [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Different biological materials that are acid liable can be stabilized in gastrointestinal fluids by using coating substances to pass through the acidic condition of the stomach. Therefore, encapsulated bacteria can survive acidic and alkali conditions during intestinal transition [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this work, we isolated a LAB strain from white clover legumes and determined its potential probiotics properties. Also, the isolated strain was microencapsulated with alginate beads, and its survivability in<italic> in-vitro</italic> simulated gastrointestinal fluid was examined. In addition, fermentation quality of radish kimchi added with such microencapsulated LAB strain was determined in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Experimental Study</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Isolation and Identification of Endophytic Lactobacillus Strains</title><p>Isolation and identification of LAB strains followed those described previously by Valan Arasu et al. (2014) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] with minor modifications. Three types of silage samples including hairy vetch, red clover, and white clover were used for the isolation of novel LABs. A 10g of each sample was weighted aseptically condition and 100ml of MRS broth was added. The broth was kept in a shaker 120rpm at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hrs. After that, the serial dilutions were made for each sample and appropriate volume was evenly spread onto the MRS agar plate. Milky white single colonies were grown and selected (based on color, shape, size, and rough or smooth surface) and then purified using streak plate method by same agar medium. The purified strain was numbered KCC-42 and supplemented with 40% (V/V) glycerol stock and stored at -20&#x000b0;C for further studies. Then, the isolated genomic DNA samples were sent to Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) for 16srRNA sequencing and then obtained sequence was manually aligned and compared with previously published sequences of bacterial strains in NCBI BLAST online database system.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Survival Properties of Selected Strains under Different Conditions</title><p>Survival abilities of encapsulated and nonencapsulated LAB were then analyzed under different environments (simulated gastric and intestinal fluid). Previously freeze-dried LAB KCC-42 was subjected to colony counting in MRS agar by pour plate method. Then 0.5 g of microencapsulated LAB strain was dissolved in 4.5 ml of sterile saline and exposed into freshly prepared simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGF) (pH 1.9) containing pepsin in saline water. Aliquots samples were taken at different time intervals (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) to determine the number of colonies by MRS agar plating method. Bile and pancreatin (1g/l and 0.1g/l, respectively) were then added into the SIF and pH value of the sample was adjusted using 0.5 N NaOH followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hrs. Subsequently, simulated gastrointestinal fluid (45 ml) was prepared in 0.1% pancreatin and 3.6% bile in saline solution.

A total of 45 bacterial strains were isolated from these plant sources. Based on their growth profiles in different selective plant juices and their antagonistic activities against pathogenic fungus, one potential isolate named KCC-42 was selected (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref>). It was then subjected to biochemical and molecular identification. For molecular characterization, 16s rRNA of this isolate was partially sequenced. Its sequence similarities with others were analyzed using NCBI BLAST program. Results of BLAST analysis revealed that it shared high sequence identities (99%) with 16srRNA sequence of<italic> Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>.

The isolated LAB strain KCC-42 showed various degrees of inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungal spores, and results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>. It is known that LAB can produce organic acid and bioactive metabolites that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. Hence, inhibitory activities of LAB KCC-42 might be directly associated with its ability to secrete organic acid and bioactive compounds in the medium.</p><p>Probiotic microorganisms are involved in several health protection mechanisms within the digestive system and internal organs. They are concerned production of pathogen inhibitory metabolites, nutritional competition with pathogenic organisms for the epithelial active site, degradation of toxins and their receptors and modulating the immune response and host, etc. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Also, the oral administration of the microencapsulated probiotics formulated yoghurt could suppress the intestinal inflammation and general functioning which leads to increasing host protection against various pathogens. The supplementation of probiotics is effectively controlled inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

Antibiotic Susceptibility of Selected Strain KCC-42</title><p>The<italic> L. plantarum</italic> KCC-42 was sensitive to various antibiotic agents.

It was found to be very sensitive to most commercial antimicrobial agents such as streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. However, it showed moderate resistance against some antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin. Antimicrobial resistance is a challenging issue globally for the healthcare sector, leading to the ineffectiveness of some antibiotics against resistant microorganisms. It has been recognized that antibiotic resistance is due to excessive or inappropriate intake of drugs, leading to less effectiveness and chromosomal resistance of the host. For these reasons, live beneficial bacteria have been used to screen their potential to control harmful pathogenic organisms. Some of them have been found to be more effective in controlling pathogen survival than antibiotics in the host system.<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> strains (POAL: Probiotics Originating from Aloe Leaf) inhibited the growth of many harmful enteropathogens without affecting normal flora in the gut. Moreover, each strain exhibited selective resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. In particular, the overexpression of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene in<italic> L. brevis</italic> could be possible to produce a beneficial neurotransmitter and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in intestinal system reported by Kim et al.

Autoaggregation Activity of LAB Strain KCC-42</title><p>Cell binding properties of the isolated strain KCC-42 were evaluated by autoaggregation assay. This strain showed potential cell binding properties against food borne pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). We also further explored this strain's binding affinities to cell surface and epithelial cells. This<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> strain showed high autoaggregation abilities toward tested pathogens. The adherence ability of LAB has been associated by their surface properties, which consecutively is reflected by the structure, composition, and organization of the cell wall. The cell wall of<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> was made up of a thick peptidoglycan layer, including other surface components such as lipoteichoic acids, polysaccharides, covalently bound proteins, and S-layer proteins. It was previously reported that these components are likely to contribute to the surface properties of a microbial consortium [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In the past two decades, bio-organic derived foods are attracting a lot of attention in food and agricultural industries due to their health benefits for human and the environment. Nonpathogenic LABs have been used in the fermentation process naturally. They are strongly resistant to artificial gastric, bile, and intestinal juices. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the novel<italic> L. plantarum </italic>KCC-42 to survive different acid and salt conditions, especially for fermentation of native Korean radish kimchi. Our results revealed that the microencapsulated LAB strain KCC-42 was more stable (having higher number of colonies) than nonencapsulated strain KCC-42. In addition, this<italic> Lactobacillus </italic>strain KCC-42 was able to inhibit the growth of selected pathogens under<italic> in-vitro</italic> condition. It is known that plant-derived LABs have stronger resistance to low pH than animal-derived LAB because their outer membranes are thicker and more solid than their animal-derived counterparts. Therefore, they can adapt to harsh environment conditions more easily. Gao et al. (2012) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have reported that one of the important criteria of a probiotic strain is that it has antagonistic activity against harmful pathogens. Probiotics strains might produce some inhibitory substances such as organic acid, bacteriocin, and peptides.

Encapsulated bacteria were found to have higher survival rate than nonencapsulated KCC-42 after exposure to simulated gastric juice (SGJ) (pH 1.9) for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). The number of survived nonencapsulated bacteria was gradually decreased after 30 min of SGJ exposure. After SGJ treatment, both cells were directly transferred to SIJ (pH 6.5) and exposed for 60 min. Encapsulated cells showed higher viability rate 7.48&#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml and tolerance to high acidic/pancreatin medium compared to nonencapsulated cells 6.50&#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml. This indicated that encapsulated cells could survive the stomach and remain active in the intestine. However, nonencapsulated cells were less resistant to simulated gastrointestinal fluid exposure compared to encapsulated cells of KCC-42. Hence, encapsulated probiotic strain KCC-42 might be useful in kimchi fermentation due to its tolerance to acidic and alkali medium. LAB growth was increased in the acidic environment of<italic> koozh</italic> (pH 4.5) which is made of finger millet and rice that consider as a good substrate for a probiotic carrier molecule.

Thus, microencapsulation has been a promising technique for a good and reliable protection of the bacteria in different conditions. Microencapsulation can be protected against cell injury or loss by retaining cells within the encapsulating membrane. Many ways are used to enforce probiotics such as spray-drying, emulsion, extrusion, and other technologies in combination with a suitable coating material such as alginate, chitosan, and combination of other biopolymers [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7.

Quantification of Organic Acid Produced in Fermented Radish Kimchi Samples</title><p>Encapsulated LAB KCC-42 tolerated the acidic nature of fermented kimchi samples. Reduction in pH was noticed in both kimchi samples inoculated with encapsulated or nonencapsulated LAB cells, eventually producing organic acid in fermented kimchi samples. Results of quantification of organic acid produced in kimchi samples inoculated with encapsulated or nonencapsulated LAB cells are shown in <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S3</xref> (A-E). The lactic acid was high amount. 55.6mM g/DW was produced in encapsulated LAN inoculated radish kimchi sample. It was 3-fold higher than nonencapsulated cells added kimchi. Kimchi is a traditional Korean cuisine mainly made of fermented vegetables with a mixture of salt and other side dishes such as pepper, chilli powder, ginger, garlic, and fruits to enhance its flavor and improve the fermentation process which usually takes a few weeks. LAB could naturally enhance functional properties, flavor, and safety of fermented vegetable products. Kailasapathy et al. (2006) [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have studied yoghurt added with free or encapsulated LAB strains and found that encapsulated strains show lower pH survivability than free strains during the fermentation period. Similarly, Aymerich et al. (2006) [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have reported that LAB strain is resistant to acid produced condition during fermentation of sausage. After 7 or 14 days of ripening period, the pH was steadily decreased from 5.89 to 5.42 or from 6.16 to 5.50, respectively. Similarly, Cha et al. (2008) [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have reported natural probiotic flora typically processes kimchi fermentation. They found that LABs isolated from Dongchimi (radish kimchi) have potent tolerance to aciduric and alkali conditions.</p><p>Also, kimchi is a famous Korean tradition fermented food using vegetables, it contains various native LAB strains, including<italic> Bacillus sp</italic>.,<italic> Lactococcus </italic>sp.<italic>, Lactobacillus </italic>sp.,<italic> and Weissella </italic>sp. The LAB strains that are involved during kimchi fermentation and different nutritional substance are believed to have possible health benefits for human. Among the several species, the<italic> Lb. plantarum</italic> are present in fermented vegetables due to their potent resistance to survive in high saline and acidity content of fermented vegetables, such as cabbage, cucumber, sauerkraut, and olive [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Naturally occurred probiotic organisms in kimchi samples have been found to possess potent anticancer and antioxidant activities. The viability of strain KCC-42 in kimchi sample added with nonencapsulated cells was strongly affected by the reduction in pH. It has been reported that wild microbes such as<italic> Lactobacillus</italic> and<italic> Leuconostoc</italic> bacterial genera play key roles in kimchi fermentation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The LAB utilizing the sugar in anaerobic conditions resulted in producing acids and reducing pH in the fermented samples. The fermented products contain different primary and secondary metabolites which are effectively identified by various analytical techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), LC-MS, and GC-MS. GC-MS is commonly used for metabolic analysis of fermented food samples. Nevertheless, the HPLC has an inferior chromatographic resolution. But it is more convenient technique and measures a wider range of analytes with higher sensitivity [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, the number of total LAB or<italic> L. rhamnosus</italic> in fermentative sample did not show significant differences between control and treated groups after 49 days of the manufacturing process (ripening and storage). Based on RAPD-PCR analysis, bacterial counts of<italic> L. rhamnosus</italic> were found to be increased from 7 log CFU/g to 8.8 log CFU/g during the first seven days of ripening. This level was maintained until the end of the ripening time (day 14, 8.3 log CFU/g) [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the alginate microencapsulated and free form<italic> Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> ssp. was added to part-skim Mozzarella cheese product. The storage at refrigerated condition showed no changes in the free and encapsulated bacterial samples; however, both kinds of cheese bacterial count were decreased significantly during storage period. So, the encapsulation did not increase the survival rate in SGJ containing HCl. On the other hand, it was unexpected that alginate encapsulated cheese product increased the survival rate of<italic> L. paracasei</italic> in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> SGJ [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Quick drop in pH of kimchi samples might inhibit the growth of spoilage bacteria. We found that the amount of lactic acid produced in kimchi sample inoculated with encapsulated LAB strain KCC-42 pH (pH 3.65) was lower than that in kimchi sample added with nonencapsulated bacteria (pH 4.62). In addition, amounts of acetic acid and succinic acid were slightly different between kimchi samples inoculated with encapsulated bacterial and those inoculated with nonencapsulated bacteria. Fermentation of sugars to provide organic acids such as lactic acid, acetic acid, and butyric acid has been found to be associated with the pH decrease of fermentation medium. Chookietwattana et al. (2014) [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have reported that organic acid production amount is high when sample pH is more than 6. However, acid production is slow when sample pH is reduced to 5 due to the nature of LAB growth under acidic condition and slowly decreased number of viable counts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>A wide range of beneficial bacteria are present in plant sources, particularly forage crops. They might have potent applications for food, agricultural, and livestock industries. Among 45 isolated bacteria, we selected a potent LAB strain KCC-42 based on its probiotic properties such as fast growth pattern, antagonistic performance, and antibiotic susceptibility. Microencapsulated LAB strain KCC-42 was found to be able to significantly improve kimchi fermentation quality more than nonencapsulated bacteria cells. Kimchi sample inoculated with encapsulated LAB strain KCC-42 also showed higher increase in the production of organic acids with increasing fermentation time compared to kimchi sample inoculated with nonencapsulated cells. In addition, fermented radish kimchi sample contained other major metabolized products such as lactic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and succinic acid secreted by this LAB strain. Therefore, microencapsulated LAB could be useful for food and beverage industries as an alternative of chemical preservative during food processing process.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-1"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><caption><p> Table S1 shows the antibiotic susceptibility of isolated LAB KCC-42.
