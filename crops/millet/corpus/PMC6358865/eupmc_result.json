    "Pollen is the male gametophyte of higher plants. Its major function is to deliver sperm cells to the ovule to ensure successful fertilization. During this process, many interactions occur among pollen tubes and pistil cells and tissues, and calcium ion (Ca2+) dynamics mediate these interactions among cells to ensure that pollen reaches the embryo sac. Although the precise functions of Ca2+ dynamics in the cells are unknown, we can speculate about its roles on the basis of its spatial and temporal characteristics during these interactions. The results of many studies indicate that calcium is a critical element that is strongly related to pollen germination and pollen tube growth."
