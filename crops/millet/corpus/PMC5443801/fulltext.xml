Lake Baikal&#x02019;s western shore has a rich Holocene archaeological record that tracks these processes. The Early Bronze Age here is evidenced by numerous forager burials. The Early Iron Age (EIA) is thought to mark the arrival of pastoralists, but archaeological remains from this period have received little analysis. New radiocarbon dates for EIA human remains from 23 cemeteries indicate that no burials were created along this shore for ~900 years. This period, from ~3670 to 2760&#x02009;cal. BP, spans from the end of the Early Bronze Age to the advent of the EIA. The burial gap may mark disruption of local foraging populations through incursions by non-local pastoralists. Radiocarbon dates on faunal remains indicate that domestic herd animals first appear around 3275&#x02009;cal. BP, just prior to the first EIA human burials. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human remains and zooarchaeological data indicate that domestic fauna were minor dietary components for EIA people. Like preceding foragers, the EIA groups relied extensively on Baikal&#x02019;s aquatic food sources, indicating that the scale of pastoralism during this period was relatively limited.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pastoralism was critical to many major social and economic transitions in the prehistory of Eurasia, particularly in its steppe zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

</p><p>Hundreds of sets of Middle Holocene human skeletal remains from graves in Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e, the Angara River Valley, and the Upper Lena have been repeatedly radiocarbon dated, and their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Radiocarbon dating of stratigraphically-associated deer and Baikal seal remains from habitation sites along the Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e shoreline, in conjunction with paired human and terrestrial faunal bone from individual graves in various regions west of the lake, have all demonstrated major locally-specific freshwater reservoir effects (FRE) in the region&#x02019;s aquatic food webs, rendering the radiocarbon ages of some human graves as much as 600 years too old<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Bayesian modeling of the radiocarbon dates for the region&#x02019;s Middle Holocene cemeteries, including local corrections for the FREs, indicate that foragers began regularly burying their dead in these areas around 8300&#x02009;cal. BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A gap occurs in this burial record between 7000 and 5600&#x02009;cal. BP, which is followed by two sequential phases of forager interment, the latter persisting until ~3700&#x02009;cal. BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The latter phase of forager burials is termed the Early Bronze Age (EBA). Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data indicate that foragers in all of these regions and time periods had diets of mixed aquatic and terrestrial food types, with lake fish and Baikal seal being significant staples for some individuals buried in Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e and on the lake&#x02019;s southwest shore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Areas along the western shore of Lake Baikal also contain a rich Late Holocene archaeological record. Much of this derives from Early Iron Age pastoralists, including graves and other ritual features typologically assigned to several mortuary traditions or cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The best known is the Slab Grave (Plitochnaia) tradition, which is thought to mark the earliest settlement of the region by pastoralists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Slab graves are widespread across southern Trans-Baikal and much of eastern and northern Mongolia; this culture is almost exclusively known through its mortuary sites, as habitation sites of this period are rare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. On the western shore of Baikal, graves assigned to the Slab Grave and other Early Iron Age mortuary traditions (Butuheiskoe, Elginskoe) sometimes hold iron weaponry and other metal items such as horse bits, as well as skeletal remains of domestic animals (horse, cattle, sheep, goat)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>Despite the importance of the Early Iron Age in the region&#x02019;s prehistory, little research has been dedicated to understanding the timing of its appearance, including how this relates to the chronology of local forager mortuary traditions, and how diets and subsistence practices of these two groups and periods compare. One limiting factor has been the lack of stable isotope data for the region&#x02019;s Early Iron Age human remains, which would allow their radiocarbon dates to be corrected for the FREs and dietary patterns to be better understood. No systematic radiocarbon dating of these human remains has been made prior to this study. Equally important, two Late Holocene habitation sites along the western Baikal shoreline with extensively dated faunal assemblages are now available, providing additional data on local subsistence and dietary patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>This paper provides the first analyses of stable isotope values and AMS radiocarbon dates for human remains from the western shore of Lake Baikal post-dating the Early Bronze Age. We also integrate zooarchaeological data from two habitation sites, which provide additional insight on the relative importance of domestic ungulates and wild fauna in the diet and subsistence practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For this study, 47 AMS radiocarbon dates on adult human remains from graves typologically assigned to the Early Iron Age are available, including 11 from North Baikal, 34 from Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e, and one each from the Kuda Valley and South Baikal; all have &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values and come from a total of 23 cemeteries (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; see Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Six radiocarbon dates on domestic ungulate remains recovered from some of these cemeteries also are available (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). These appear to be remains of sacrifices conducted around the time of human mortuary rites that were subsequently interred near or in the grave. The uncalibrated ages of the human burials range from ~2850 to 1985 BP (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In comparison, the Early Bronze Age forager burials in this region have uncalibrated ages ranging from ~4410 to 3410 BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The dates on domestic animal remains from the Early Iron Age cemeteries have uncalibrated ages ranging between ~2585 to 2360 BP, provisionally post-dating the earliest Early Iron Age burials by a few centuries (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p><p>Stable isotope analysis show that the Early Iron Age human remains have a mean &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C value of &#x02212;18.5&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of 13.6&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.39) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Remains from domestic fauna recovered from the Early Iron Age cemeteries, including 19 total horse, cattle, and caprine specimens, have &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values ranging from &#x02212;21.3 to &#x02212;18.9&#x02030;, and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values from 3.6 to 7.9&#x02030;, with an overall average &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C value of &#x02212;20.3&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of 5.7&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.4) (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The previously reported &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N mean value for wild ungulates from this same region is 5.1&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0), and average &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C value is &#x02212;19.6&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8), both similar to those of the domestic fauna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Stable isotope values for Early Bronze Age (EBA) and Early Iron Age (EIA) human bone collagen, and for EIA domestic fauna.

</p><p>Bone collagen &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values provide an indication of trophic level, with an expected enrichment of 3&#x02013;6&#x02030; along the food chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of the EIA human remains is 7.9&#x02030; higher than the mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of the domestic ungulates (13.6&#x02030; versus 5.7&#x02030;, respectively), and 8.5&#x02030; higher than that of the wild ungulates (5.1&#x02030;). The &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of the EIA humans range from 11.0 to 15.9&#x02030; (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.), meaning that the individual with the lowest &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values is 5.3&#x02030;, or about one trophic level, above the average for the domestic fauna. Even using the highest trophic level fractionation value of 6&#x02030;, these comparisons indicate that most EIA individuals were consuming protein from sources other than just domestic or wild ungulates. Previously reported mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values for Lake Baikal fish and seal are 11.5&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.7) and 13.7&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Both have mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values at least one full trophic level above those of local terrestrial ungulates, and consumption of these aquatic resources could easily account for the elevated &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of the EIA humans observed in this study. Further to this point, the mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value for the EIA humans (13.6&#x02030;) is almost identical to that of the Baikal seal, which feeds exclusively on lake fish.</p><p>The &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values of human remains from the Baikal region are far less straightforward to interpret in regard to consumption of aquatic foods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Fish from the lake have highly variable &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values, with bone collagen values ranging from &#x02212;28.6 to &#x02212;9.6&#x02030;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Such variability occurs because of the extremes in basic productivity within the lake, which range from very negative &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values among the phytoplankton in its deeper sections, to far more positive values among the blue-green algae in its shallower sections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Fish can feed in sections of the lake dominated by both of these extremes over their lives, or feed largely in just one of them, resulting in highly variably &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values even within individual species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Further, the higher &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values for fish from Lake Baikal overlap with those of C4 plants, adding yet more complication to interpretation of &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values. Millet, a C4 plant, has not been documented in the study area during the periods of interest here, but was identified at the Iron Age Ivolgin site near Ulan-Ude, ~100 east of Lake Baikal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and thus was potentially consumed by the EIA individuals studied here. The other major aquatic food source, the Baikal seal, has a far narrower range of &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values than the fish, from &#x02212;23.2 to &#x02212;21.0&#x02030; (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;22.1&#x02030;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, reflecting its preferential diet of a subset of the lake&#x02019;s deeper water fish. The &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values for the EIA humans are quite variable, ranging from &#x02212;19.9 to &#x02212;14.4&#x02030;, with a mean of 18.5&#x02030;. This range of variation is likely indicative of variable reliance on terrestrial fauna, Baikal seals, shallow or deep water feeding fish, and even C4 plants such as millet.</p><p>Perhaps most informative, the average Early Iron Age human isotope values are statistically indistinguishable from those of the EBA hunter-gatherer burials (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;90) in Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) (&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C: t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.573, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.568; &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N: t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.367, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.714)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The isotope values of these hunter-gatherers have been interpreted as indicating diets of variable amounts of terrestrial mammals, fish, and Baikal seals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; consumption of C4 plants such as millet has not been invoked in interpretations of these individuals&#x02019; diets. Further, the Early Iron Age humans have higher average &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values than EBA hunter-gatherers from both the Angara (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13; &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;11.4&#x02030;, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9) and Upper Lena rivers (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14; &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.3&#x02030;, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These forager groups are said to have had protein diets consisting mostly of freshwater fish and terrestrial mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Together these comparisons provide additional indication that the Early Iron Age individuals analyzed here consumed a diet consisting of a mix of terrestrial and aquatic fauna.</p><p>Additional indications that the Late Holocene groups inhabiting the western shore of Baikal consumed terrestrial fauna and the lake&#x02019;s seals and fish are the faunal remains recovered from two habitation sites, Bugul&#x02019;deika 2 and Sagan-Zaba 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both are on the open shoreline of Baikal in Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e and appear to have been occupied from late winter through early summer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The faunal remains from these habitation sites most likely provide a better overall picture of the relative dietary importance of types of animals in the diet (during the seasons of site occupation) than faunal remains from mortuary contexts, the latter being created through sacrifice and feasting associated with human mortuary rites, not daily practices.</p><p>Bugul&#x02019;deika 2 has four components with remains of domestic ungulates, which represent intermittent site use from ~3100&#x02009;cal. BP to the modern period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The earliest component (II-3) produced a single domestic animal specimen, a horse bone, directly dated to ~2920 to 2780&#x02009;cal. BP. Baikal seal remains constitute 97.1% of the faunal assemblage from component II-3, indicating a clear focus on sealing at the site during this period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). One cattle specimen from component II-2 was directly dated to 2680 to 2350&#x02009;cal. BP, and this layer also produced remains of horse and caprines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

</p><p>Sagan-Zaba 2, which was consistently sieved during excavation, has two components with remains of domestic ungulates, representing intermittent occupation of the site area from ~1970 and 940&#x02009;cal. BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In the earlier of the two components (IIIA), domesticate remains account for only 16.0% of the total faunal assemblage, and wild ungulates just 5.1%, while fish and Baikal seal constitute a total of 78.9% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The faunal assemblage from the latest component (II-I) shows an increase in the relative importance of domestic ungulates, which form 38.4% of the total remains, however fish and seal still make up 47.9% of the component, and wild ungulates 13.8%. The earliest directly dated domestic ungulate remains at Sagan-Zaba 2 are from a horse in component IIIA, which dates to 1880 to 1730&#x02009;cal. BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Given the stable isotope and zooarchaeological indications of human consumption of both terrestrial and aquatic fauna during the Late Holocene, the Early Iron Age human radiocarbon dates should be just as biased by the region&#x02019;s freshwater reservoir effects as are those of its previous forager inhabitants, who had similarly structured diets. For this study, the Early Iron Age human dates were corrected using the same methods developed for the earlier forager burials (see Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The corrections to the uncalibrated dates ranged from 110 to 500 years (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The 47 Early Iron Age dates, and 91 recently published dates for Early Bronze Age burials from this same region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> were then modeled to estimate the start and end dates for the two phases of burial, and the amount of time that elapsed between the end of the Early Bronze Age burials and the advent of those assigned to the Early Iron Age (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, see Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>. The trapezium distribution model indicates that the Early Iron Age burials first appeared between 2760 to 2485&#x02009;cal. BP. The uniform distribution model estimates a similar age range for the advent of these burials, at 2775 to 2515 BP. Both models indicate a clear temporal gap in human burials in this region of over 900 years, with the estimated end of the EBA burials occurring by ~3630 BP.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Modeled radiocarbon ages for human remains and domestic faunal remains.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="2">Trapezium Model</th><th colspan="2">Uniform Distribution Model</th></tr><tr><th>Modeled Cal BP age (95.4%)</th><th>Modeled BC/AD age (95.4%)</th><th>Modeled Cal BP age (95.4%)</th><th>Modeled BC/AD age (95.4%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">Human remains</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Early Bronze Age end</td><td>3800 to 3670 BP</td><td>1850 to 1720 BC</td><td>3760 to 3630 BP</td><td>1815 to 1680 BC</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Early Iron Age start</td><td>2760 to 2485 BP</td><td>810 to 535 BC</td><td>2775 to 2515 BP</td><td>825 to 565 BC</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Early Iron Age end</td><td>2080 to 1710 BP</td><td>130 BC to 245 AD</td><td>1905 to 1690 BP</td><td>50 to 260 AD</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Span EBA end to EIA start</td><td>960 to 1270 years</td><td>960 to 1270 years</td><td>na</td><td>na</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Faunal remains</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Domestic fauna start</td><td>3275 to 2605 BP</td><td>1325 to 655 BC</td><td>3180 to 2780 BP</td><td>1230 to 830 BC</td></tr><tr><td>&#x000a0;Domestic fauna end</td><td>2220 to 1440 BP</td><td>275 BC to 510 AD</td><td>1890 to 1475 BP</td><td>60 to 475 AD</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Date ranges are given at 95% confidence levels.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
</p><p>The radiocarbon dates on domestic fauna remains from the Early Iron Age cemeteries and habitation site components (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) were also modeled as a single phase, using both trapezium and uniform distribution models (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). The mean &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value for these samples is 5.8&#x02030; (s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3), indicating these animals were not consuming aquatic fauna and that their radiocarbon dates are not biased by the region&#x02019;s FREs. The modeled starting age ranges for these dates predate and somewhat overlap with the modeled starting date ranges for the Early Iron Age human burials, but in neither model do they overlap in age with the Early Bronze Age dates. In other words, domestic herd animals were present in the region slightly before Early Iron Age burials first appear. Caution is warranted, as the total number of dated domestic fauna is quite small in comparison to the number of dated human remains.</p><p>Finally, to assess if there were chronological trends in the Early Iron Age stable isotope data, the human burials&#x02019; mean modeled radiocarbon ages were plotted against their &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N and &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). These analyses showed no significant correlation in either isotope ratio by age, indicating no statistically significant trends in the diets of these individuals through time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The multi-century temporal gap in human burials between the end of the Early Bronze Age and start of Early Iron Age was entirely unrecognized prior to this study. This gap is unlikely to be a product of sampling or research effort. First, the region&#x02019;s burials have been extensively excavated and radiocarbon dated, with hundreds of dates on human remains and the faunal bone artifacts associated with them now available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This includes radiocarbon dating of Early Bronze Age graves from all three sub-regions west of Lake Baikal (Angara-Southwest Baikal, Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e, Upper Lena), with none of these dating to the gap period. Second, while Okladnikov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> originally identified several Bronze Age mortuary traditions in this region based on grave typology, subsequent radiocarbon dating of graves matching his types along the western Baikal shore has shown that all date within the Early Bronze Age period as it is now defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The Late Bronze Age is currently unrepresented in the region&#x02019;s mortuary remains. Third, the western shore of Lake Baikal has been repeatedly surveyed for archaeological sites since the 1940s, and the Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e region in particular has experienced significant development for tourism over the last two decades or so, resulting in numerous surveys and test excavations. In other words, it seems unlikely that the gap in burials can be attributed to lack of effort to locate sites.</p><p>It is presently unclear why this temporal gap in burials occurs, but it may relate to broader regional environmental and cultural changes. We are unaware of any significant correlation between environmental change and the end of the Early Bronze Age burials in this region. One remaining possibility is that groups from neighboring areas disrupted the foragers living along Baikal&#x02019;s west shore through brief incursions, resulting in population dispersal or even abandonment of some areas. Conceivably, such groups could have been pastoralists from areas such as Trans-Baikal to the east or Mongolia to the south. Similar shifts or differences in demography (related in part to environmental changes) have been linked to the lack of interments in this region in previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and may also explain the lack of burials dating to the gap period identified here. However, there is currently no evidence the end of the Early Bronze Age was due to permanent settlement of western shore of Baikal by pastoral groups. Specifically, even the earliest date on domestic ungulates from the western shore of the lake (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) post-dates the end of the Early Bronze Age by centuries, and the modeled date range for the domestic fauna is at least 400 years after the modeled end range of these earlier burials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The directly dated domestic animals described here, however, have a modeled age range mostly predating the Early Iron burials. This suggests animal keeping may have begun in this region a few centuries before the first Iron Age graves appear. Notably, the number of well dated habitation sites from this period and region is very low (there are only two), as is the number of dates on domestic fauna. Clearly, confirmation of this pattern with additional data is warranted.</p><p>The advent of Early Iron Age burials along the western shore appears to correlate with an episode of marked local environmental change. Analysis of pollen from a lake core in the Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e region indicates that this area experienced a very high rate of vegetation turnover from 2750 to 2480&#x02009;cal. BP, marking the onset of drier continental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Such conditions may have been more suitable for animal-keeping groups, but this hypothesis requires additional research. Conversely, steppe biomes were clearly present in this region prior to this period of abrupt change during the Middle Holocene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that environments potentially suitable for maintaining herd animals were available here long before such animals are present in the archaeological record. Regardless, the advent of Early Iron Age burials along the western shore of Baikal likely represents the initiation of permanent settlement of the region by groups keeping herd animals. The radiocarbon dates indicate that Iron Age graves were constructed along parts of the western shore for many centuries, and remains of domestic animals were present a few centuries earlier. Genetic studies and additional radiocarbon dating (and assessment for local FREs) of Iron Age graves in adjacent regions, such as Trans-Baikal, are needed to determine if this represents colonization of the region by outside groups, the adoption of animal-keeping by local people, or some combination of both processes.</p><p>The average extent of reliance on domestic herd animals as food sources appears to have been relatively minor among the Early Iron Age individuals studied here. The stable isotope and zooarchaeological data both indicate substantial reliance on the region&#x02019;s aquatic fauna, including lake fish and Baikal seal. The stable isotope data provide no indication that this pattern in food consumption changed over the course of the Early Iron Age. The zooarchaeological record suggests a slow increase in the relative abundance of domestic animals over the entire Late Holocene, not an abrupt transition to heavily reliance on these animals during the Early Iron Age. The low level of pastoralism along the western shore is also supported by local pollen and spore records, which provide no evidence for extensive herding in the region until well into the AD 1800s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p>Overall, while the Early Iron Age groups of the western Baikal shore clearly kept domestic herd animals, they had diets reminiscent of the region&#x02019;s earlier Bronze Age foraging populations. Animal-keeping during this period was small-scale, and was carried out in conjunction with a significant amount of both hunting and fishing, as is seen in this region today<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The mixed pastoral-foraging practices indicated by our data are in many ways not surprising, as ancient groups in many areas of Central Asia clearly had diets consisting of a mix of wild and domestic animals, which in some areas included aquatic fauna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In other words, these groups often had broader diets than the term &#x02018;pastoral&#x02019; implies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>&#x02014;people were keeping herd animals, but were often not wholly reliant upon them as dietary items.</p><p>Movements of animal-keeping populations into the boreal forest region of Siberia likely were major transformative processes. For example, such northward migrations of pastoral societies have long have been linked to a number of important developments, ranging from the origins of reindeer husbandry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, to the arrival of Turkic-speaking groups and their horses in the Arctic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, to the emergence of highly stratified settled societies along the Pacific Coast of the Russian Far East<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Clearly these episodes of dispersal and cultural change affecting vast areas of North Asia are worthy of additional intensive study, including more detailed analyses of the interactions between resident groups and newcomers. Reliable chronologies are fundamental for such studies, and in many cases refining these will require adjustments in radiocarbon dates for old carbon effects, whether they are due to the use of marine or freshwater foods. We hope this study offers inspiration for such research in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Stable Isotope Analysis</title><p>Standard &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N extraction and preparation procedures for bone collagen were followed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

This equation is preferred because it allows all burial dates to be adjusted in the same way, and leaves open the possibility that the individuals inhabited several of the areas west of Lake Baikal, incorporating carbon from all of them into their skeletal remains. This method is the preferred one, and was used in calculating the modeled calibrated age ranges presented in the text. The second method employed local equations where possible (e.g., the Priol&#x02019;khon&#x02019;e and South Baikal/Angara regression equations for burials from those respective regions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and used the general equation when local equations were lacking (e.g., for North Baikal burials and the individual from the Kuda Valley) (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).
