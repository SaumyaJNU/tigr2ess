One of the major components of the green revolution was new varieties of major grain crops produced through conventional phenotypic selection with higher yield potentially. Since the green revolution, the need for food has continued to increase, and a great deal of effort in the public and private sectors is devoted to developing crop varieties with higher yield potential. However, as the low-hanging fruit for increased yield vanish, each new increase in yield requires more time and resources. Recent studies have demonstrated that yield increases may have slowed or stopped for some major grain crops in large regions of the world [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. New approaches to plant breeding must be developed if crop production continues to grow to meet the needs of an increasing population around the world.</p><p>The major bottleneck in modern plant breeding is phenotyping. Phenotyping can be used in 2 ways. First, by phenotyping a large set of lines, a plant breeder can identify those lines with the highest yield potential and/or greatest stress tolerance in a given environment. Second, sufficiently detailed phenotyping measurements from enough different plants can be combined with genotypic data to identify regions of the genome of a particular plant species that carry beneficial or deleterious alleles. The breeder can then develop new crop varieties that incorporate as many beneficial alleles and exclude as many deleterious alleles as possible. Phenotyping tends to be expensive and low throughput, yet as breeders seek to identify larger numbers of alleles, each with individually smaller effects, the amount of phenotyping required to achieve a given increase in yield potential is growing. High-throughput computer vision&#x02013;based approaches to plant phenotyping have the potential to ameliorate this bottleneck. These tools can be used to precisely quantify even subtle traits in plants and will tend to decrease in unit cost with scale, while conventional phenotyping, which remains a human labor&#x02013;intensive process, does not.</p><p>Several recent pilot studies have applied a range of image processing techniques to extract phenotypic measurements from crop plants. RGB (R: Red channel; G: Green channel; B: Blue channel) camera technology, widely used in the consumer sector, has also been the most widely used tool in these initial efforts at computer vision&#x02013;based plant phenotyping [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>]. Other types of cameras including fluoresence [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and near-infrared (NIR) [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have also been employed in high-throughput plant phenotyping efforts, primarily in studies of the response of plants to different abiotic stresses.</p><p>However, the utility of current studies is limited in 2 ways. First, current analysis tools can extract only a small number of different phenotypic measurements from images of crop plants. Approximately 150 tools for analyzing plant image data are listed in a field-specific database; however, the majority of these either are developed specifically for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which is a model plant, or are designed specifically to analyze images of roots [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Second, a great deal of image data is generated in controlled environments; however, there have been comparatively few attempts to link phenotypic measurements in the greenhouse to performance in the field. However, one recent report in maize suggested that more than 50% of the total variation in yield under field conditions could be predicted using traits measured under controlled environments [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Advances in computational tools for extracting phenotypic measurements of plants from image data and statistical models for predicting yield under different field conditions from such measurements require suitable training datasets. Here, we generate and validate such a dataset consisting of high-throughput phenotyping data from 32 distinct maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) accessions, drawn primarily from recently off-patent lines developed by major plant breeding companies. These accessions were selected specifically because paired data from the same lines exist for a wide range of plant phenotypes collected in 54 distinct field trials at locations spanning 13 North American states or provinces over 2&#x000a0;years [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This extremely broad set of field sites captures much of the environmental variation among areas in which maize is cultivated, with total rainfall during the growing season ranging from 133.604&#x000a0;mm to 960.628&#x000a0;mm (excluding sites with supplemental irrigation) and peak temperatures during the growing season ranging from 23.5&#x000b0;C to 34.9&#x000b0;C. In addition, the same lines have been genotyped for approximately 200 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using genotype by sequencing (GBS) [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Toward these existing data, we added RGB, thermal infrared, fluorescent and hyperspectral images collected once per day per plant, as well as detailed water use information (single-day, single-plant resolution). At the end of the experiment, 12 different types of ground truth phenotypes were measured for individual plants, including destructive measurements. A second experiment focused on interactions between genotype and environmental stress, collecting the same types of data described above from 2 maize genotypes under well&#x02013;watered and water-stressed conditions [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We are releasing this curated dataset of high-throughput plant phenotyping images from accessions where data on both genotypic variation and agronomic performance under field conditions are already available. All data were generated using a Lemnatec-designed high-throughput greenhouse-based phenotyping system constructed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This system is distinguished from existing public sector phenotyping systems in North America by both the ability to grow plants to a height of 2.5 meters and the incorporation of a hyperspectral camera [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the unique properties described above, this comprehensive dataset should lower the barriers to the development of new computer vision approaches or statistical methodologies by independent researchers who do not have the funding or infrastructure to generate the wide range of different types of data needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-2-1"><title>Greenhouse management</title><p>All imaged plants were grown in the greenhouse facility of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln&#x02019;s Greenhouse Innovation Center (Latitude: 40.83, Longitude: &#x02212;96.69) between 2 October 2015 to 10 November 2015.

Sequential pairs of 2 rows consisted of a complete replicate with either 31 genotypes and 1 empty control pot or 32 genotypes.

The 4 types of cameras were thermal infrared, fluorescence, conventional RGB, and hyperspectral [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Images were collected in the order that the camera types are listed in the previous sentence. On each day, plants were imaged sequentially by row, starting with row 1 column 1 and concluding with row 10, column 16 (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>).</p><p>Plants were imaged from the side at 2 angles offset 90 degrees from each other, as well as a top down view. On the first day of imaging or when plants reached the 2-leaf stage of development, the pot was rotated so that the major axis of leaf phylotaxy was parallel to the camera in the PA0 orientation and perpendicular to the camera in the PA90 orientation. This orientation is consistent for all cameras and was not adjusted again for the remainder of the experiment. The fluorescence camera captured images with a resolution of 1038&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1390 pixels and measured emission intensity at wavelengths between 500&#x02013;750&#x000a0;nm based on excitation, with light at 400&#x02013;500&#x000a0;nm. Plants were imaged using the same 3 perspectives employed for the thermal infrared camera. The RGB camera captured images with a resolution of 2454&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2056 pixels. Initially the zoom of the RGB camera in side views was set such that each pixel corresponded to 0.746&#x000a0;mm at the distance of the pot from the camera. Between 5 November 2015 and 10 November 2015, the zoom level of the RGB camera was reduced to keep the entire plant in the frame of the image. As a result of a system error, this same decreased zoom level was also applied to all RGB images taken on 20 October 2015. At this reduced zoom level, each pixel corresponds to 1.507&#x000a0;mm at the distance of the pot from the camera, an approximate &#x000d7;2 change. Plants were also imaged using the same 3 perspectives employed for the thermal infrared camera. The hyperspectral camera captured images with a resolution of 320 horizontal pixels. As a result of the scanning technology employed, vertical resolution ranged from 494 to 499 pixels. Hyperspectral imaging was conducted using illumination from halogen bulbs (Manufacturer Sylvania, model # ES50 HM UK 240V 35W 25&#x000b0; GU10). A total of 243 separate intensity values were captured for each pixel spanning a range of light wavelengths between 546&#x000a0;nm&#x02013;1700&#x000a0;nm. Data from each wavelength was stored as a separate grayscale image.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2-4"><title>Ground truth measurement</title><p>Ground truth measurements were collected at the termination of data collection on 11-12 November 2015.

After these measurements, total above-ground fresh weight biomass was measured for 4 out of 5 replicates, resulting in the destruction of the plants.

This method produced some false-positive plant pixels within the reflective metal columns at the edge of the image. To reduce the impact of false positives, these areas were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, when plant leaves cross the reflective metal frame, some true plant pixels were excluded.

Second, based on the difference in reflectance between stem and leaves at wavelengths of 1056&#x000a0;nm and 1151&#x000a0;nm, the stem was segmented from other parts of the plant by selecting pixels where (<italic>R</italic><sub>1056<italic>nm</italic></sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>1151<italic>nm</italic></sub>) produced a value greater than 1.2. Leaf pixels were defined as pixels identified as plant pixels based on NDVI but not classified as stem pixels. In addition to the biological variation between individual plants, overall intensity variation existed both between different plants imaged on the same day and the same plant on different days as a result of changes in the performance of the lighting used in the hyperspectral imaging chamber. To calibrate each individual image and make the results comparable, a python script (hosted on Github; see the Code availability section) was used to normalize the intensity values of each plant pixel using data from the nonplant pixels in the same image.</p><p>In order to visualize variation across 243 separate wavelength measurements across multiple plant images, we used a principal component analysis (PCA)&#x02013;based approach. After the normalization described above, PCA analysis of intensity values for individual pixels was conducted. PCA values of each individual plant pixel per analyzed plant were translated to intensity values using the formula [x-min(x)]/[max(x)-min(x)]. False color RGB images were constructed with the values for the first principal component stored in the red channel, the second principal component in the green channel, and the third principal component in the blue channel.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2-8"><title>Fluorescence image processing</title><p>A consistent area of interest was defined for each zoom level to exclude the pot and nonuniform areas of the imaging chamber backdrop.

To validate the dataset and ensure that plants had been properly tracked through both the automated imaging system and ground truth measurements, a simple script was written to segment images into plant and not-plant pixels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>).

Plant area was scored as the total number of plant pixels observed in both side view images after correcting for the area of each pixel at each zoom employed (see the Methods). Similar approaches to estimate plant biomass have been widely employed across a range of grain crop species including rice [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], wheat [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], barley [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], maize [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], sorghum [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and seteria [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Calculated values were compared with manual measurements of plant height and plant fresh biomass, which were quantified using destructive methods on the last day of the experiment. In both cases, manual measurements and image-derived estimates were highly correlated, although the correlation between manual and estimated height was greater than the correlation between manually measured and estimated biomass (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>A, B). Using the PlantCV software package [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], equivalent correlations between estimated and ground truth biomass were obtained (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91). Estimates of biomass using both software packages were more correlated with each other (<italic>r</italic> = 0.96) than either was with ground truth measurements. This suggests that a significant fraction of the remaining error is the result of the expected imperfect correlation between plant size and plant mass, rather than inaccuracies in estimating plant size using individual software packages. Recent reports have suggested that estimates of biomass incorporating multiple traits extracted from image data can increase accuracy [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We tested the accuracy of biomass prediction of 4 multivariate estimation techniques on this dataset (see the Methods). The correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic> values) of the estimated biomass measures with ground truth data were 0.949, 0.958, 0.925, and 0.951 for multivariate linear model, MARS, Random Forest, and SVM, respectively.</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p>Correlation between image-based and manual measurements of individual plants.

Using data from the multiple replicates of each individual accession, the proportion of error that is controlled by genetic factors rather than random error can be ascertained. We determined that 58% of the total error in biomass estimate was controlled by genetic variation between different maize lines. As such, this error is systematic rather than random and thus more likely to produce misleading downstream results when used in quantitative genetic analysis. As mentioned above, biomass and plant size are imperfectly correlated, as different plants can exhibit different densities, for example, as a result of different leaf-to-stem ratios. Recent reports have suggested that estimates of biomass incorporating multiple traits extracted from image data can increase accuracy [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The correlations of the estimated biomass measures with ground truth data were 0.949, 0.958, 0.925, and 0.951 for multivariate linear model, MARS, Random Forest, and SVM, respectively. However, even when employing the most accurate of these 4 methods (MARS), 63% of the error in biomass estimation could be explained by genetic factors. This source of error, with the biomass of some lines systematically underestimated and the biomass of other lines systematically overestimated, presents a significant challenge to downstream quantitative genetic analysis, given the prevalence of plant pixel counts as a proxy for biomass [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3-2"><title>Patterns of change over time</title><p>One of the desirable aspects of image-based plant phenotyping is that, unlike destructively measured phenotypes, the same plant can be imaged repeatedly. Instead of providing a snapshot in time, this allows researchers to quantify rates of change in phenotypic values over time, providing an additional set of derived trait values. Given the issues with biomass quantification presented above, measurements of plant height were selected to validate patterns of change in phenotypic values over time. As expected, height increases over time, and the patterns of increase tended to cluster together by genotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>A). Increases in height followed by declines, as observed for ZL26, were determined to be caused by a change in the angle of the main stalk. While the accuracy of height estimates was assessed by comparison with physical ground truth measurements only on the last day, the heights of 3 randomly selected plants (Plant 007-26, Plant 002-7, and Plant 041-29) were manually measured from image data and compared with software-based height estimates, and no significant differences were observed between the manual and automated measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). To perform a similar test of the accuracy of biomass estimation at different stages in the maize life cycle, a set of existing ground truth measurements for 2 genotypes under 2 stress treatments [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were combined with additional later grow stage data (Supplementary Table 2). The correlation between total plant pixels observed in the 2 side views and plant biomass was actually substantially higher in this dataset (<italic>r</italic> = 0.97) than the primary dataset, likely as a result of the smaller amount of genetic variability among these plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup10">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3:</label><caption><p>(A) Plant growth curves of each of 5 replicates of 8 selected genotypes.

Broad-sense heritability can be estimated without the need to first link specific genes to variation in specific traits [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Variation in a trait that is not controlled by genotype can result from environmental effects, interactions between genotype and environment, random variance, and measurement error. Controlling for estimated row effects on different phenotypic measurements significantly increased overall broad sense heritability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>A,B). This result suggests that even within controlled environments such as greenhouses, significant micro-environmental variation exists, and that proper statistically based experimental design remains critically important in even controlled environment phenotyping efforts.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4:</label><caption><p>(A) The time course broad sense heritability of PH90.

This trend was indeed observed across 6 different phenotypic measurements (three traits calculated from each of 2 viewing angles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>B). Plant height also exhibited significantly greater heritability than plant area or plant width and greater heritability when calculated solely from the 90-degree side angle photo than when calculated solely from the 0-degree angle photo.</p><p>In previous studies, fluorescence intensity has been treated as an indicator for plant abiotic stress status [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref>] or chlorophyll content level [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Using the fluorescence images collected as part of this experiment, the mean fluorescence intensity value for each plant image was calculated (see the Methods). We found that this trait exhibited moderate heritability, with the proportion of variation controlled by genetic factors increasing over time and reaching approximately 60% by the last day of the experiment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3-4"><title>Hyperspectral image validation</title><p>Hyperspectral imaging of crop plants has been employed previously in field settings using airborne cameras [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref>]. As a result of the architecture of grain crops such as maize, aerial imagery will largely capture leaf tissue during vegetative growth, and either tassels (maize) or seed heads (sorghum, millet, rice, oats, etc.) during reproductive growth. The dataset described here includes hyperspectral imagery taken from the side of individual plants, enabling quantification of the reflectance properties of plant stems in addition to leaf tissue.</p><p>Many uses of hyperspectral data reduce the data from a whole plant or whole plot of genetically identical plants to a single aggregate measurement. While these approaches can increase the precision of intensity measurements for individual wavelengths, these approaches also sacrifice spatial resolution and can in some cases produce apparent changes in reflectivity between plants that result from variation in the ratios of the sizes of different organs with different reflective properties. To assess the extent of variation in the reflectance properties of individual plants, a principal component analysis of variation in intensity values for individual pixels was conducted. After nonplant pixels were removed from the hyperspectral data cube (Methods), (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>A), false color images were generated encoding the intensity values of the first 3 principal components of variation as the intensity of the red, green, and blue channels, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>B, C, and D). The second principal component (green channel) marked boundary pixels where intensity values likely represent a mixture of reflectance data from the plant and from the background. The first principal component (red channel) appeared to indicate distinctions between pixels within the stem of the plant and pixels within the leaves.</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5:</label><caption><p>Segmentation and visualization of variation in hyperspectral signatures of representative maize plant images.

(D) Equivalent visualization for Plant 008-19 (ZL19).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gix117fig5"/></fig><p>Based on this observation, an index was defined that accurately separated plant pixels into leaf and stem (see the Methods). Stem pixels were segmented from the rest of the plant using an index value derived from the difference in intensity values observed in the 1056-nm and 1151-nm hyperspectral bands. This methodology was previously described [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The reflectance pattern of individual plant stems is quite dissimilar from the data observed from leaves and exhibits significantly different reflective properties in some areas of the near-infrared (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Characteristics of the stem are important breeding targets for both agronomic traits (lodging resistance, yield for biomass crops) and value-added traits (biofuel conversion potential for bioenergy crops, yield for sugarcane and sweet sorghum). Hyperspectral imaging of the stem has the potential to provide nondestructive measurements of these traits. The calculated patterns of leaf reflectance for the data presented here are comparable with those observed in field-based hyperspectral studies [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>], both providing external validation and suggesting that the data presented here may be of use in developing new indices for use under field conditions.</p><fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6:</label><caption><p>Reflectance values for 3 plants: Plant 090-6 (ZL06), Plant 002-7 (ZL07), and Plant 145-16 (ZL16) on 3&#x000a0;days across development.

Software packages already exist to measure a range of plant architectural traits such as leaf length, angle, and curvature from RGB images [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Tools are also being developed to extract phenotypic information on abiotic stress response patterns from fluorescence imaging [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The analysis of plant traits from hyperspectral image data, while commonplace in the remote sensing realm, where an entire field may represent a single data point, is just beginning for single-plant imaging. Recent work has highlighted the potential of hyperspectral imaging to quantify changes in plant composition and nutrient content throughout development [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While these techniques have great potential to accelerate efforts to link genotype to phenotype through ameliorating the current bottleneck of plant phenotypic data collection, it will be important to balance the development of new image analysis tools with the awareness of the potential for systematic error resulting from genetic variation between different lines of the same crop species.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Availability of source code and requirements</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Project name: Maize Phenotype Map</p></list-item><list-item><p>Project home page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/shanwai1234/Maize_Phenotype_Map">https://github.com/shanwai1234/Maize_Phenotype_Map</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Operating system(s): Linux</p></list-item><list-item><p>Programming language: Python 2.7</p></list-item><list-item><p>Other requirements: OpenCV module 2.4.8, Numpy &#x0003e;1.5, CMake&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2.6, GCC&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;4.4.x, Scipy 0.13</p></list-item><list-item><p>License: BSD 3-Clause License</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Availability of supporting data and materials</title><p>The image data sets from 4 types of cameras, pot weight records per day, and ground truth measurements with corresponding documentation for 32 maize inbreds and same types of image data for 2 maize inbreds under 2 stress treatments were deposited in the CyVerse data commons under a CC0 license [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
