The sheer volume of agricultural biological data being produced today makes excellent data management essential. Governmental agencies, publishers and science funders require data management plans for publicly funded research. Furthermore, the value of data increases exponentially when they are properly stored, described, integrated and shared, so that they can be easily utilized in future analyses. AgBioData (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agbiodata.org">https://www.agbiodata.org</ext-link>) is a consortium of people working at agricultural biological databases, data archives and knowledgbases who strive to identify common issues in database development, curation and management, with the goal of creating database products that are more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. We strive to promote authentic, detailed, accurate and explicit communication between all parties involved in scientific data. As a step toward this goal, we present the current state of biocuration, ontologies, metadata and persistence, database platforms, programmatic (machine) access to data, communication and sustainability with regard to data curation. Each section describes challenges and opportunities for these topics, along with recommendations and best practices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">U.S. Department of Agriculture</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000199</named-content></funding-source><award-id>5030-21000-068-00D</award-id><award-id>2030-21000-021-00D</award-id><award-id>3625-21000-062-00D</award-id><award-id>5030-21000-061-00D</award-id><award-id>2014-2014-07898</award-id><award-id>2014-51181-22376</award-id><award-id>2015-70016-23028</award-id><award-id>2016-67015-24767</award-id><award-id>8062-21000-041-00D</award-id><award-id>AFRI-005515</award-id><award-id>NRSP-10</award-id><award-id>NRSP-8</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>1443040</award-id><award-id>0735191</award-id><award-id>1265383</award-id><award-id>1444806</award-id><award-id>1127112</award-id><award-id>1340112</award-id><award-id>1444573</award-id><award-id>1564366</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>5R01HG004483</award-id><award-id>5R01GM080203</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">U.S. Department of Energy</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000015</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000865</named-content></funding-source><award-id>OP1052983</award-id><award-id>OPP1048542</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">University of Montpellier</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100008222</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-BINF- 0002</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Agence Nationale de la Recherche</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001665</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fondazione Edmund Mach</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">International Center for Tropical Agriculture</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100005346</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Research and Innovation Center</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">The Northern Pulse Growers</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">US Dry Pea and Lentil Council</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">The US Land Grant Universities</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Washington Tree Fruit Research</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="32"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We are in an exciting time in Biology. Genomic discovery on a large scale is cheaper, easier and faster than ever. Picture a world where every piece of biological data is available to researchers from easy-to-find and well-organized resources; the data are accurately described and available in an accessible and standard formats; the experimental procedures, samples and time points are all completely documented; and researchers can find answers to any question about the data that they have. Imagine that, with just a few mouse-clicks, you could determine the expression level of any gene under every condition and developmental stage that has ever been tested. You could explore genetic diversity in any gene to find mutations with consequences. Imagine seamless and valid comparisons between experiments from different groups. Picture a research environment where complete documentation of every experimental process is available, and data (with complete metadata) are always submitted to permanent public repositories, where they can be easily found and examined. We &#x02018;can&#x02019; imagine that world, and feel strongly that all outcomes of publicly funded research can and should contribute to such a system. It is simply too wasteful to &#x02018;not&#x02019; achieve this goal.</p><p>Proper data management is a critical aspect of research and publication. Scientists working on federally funded research projects are expected to make research findings publicly available. Data are the lifeblood of research, and their value often do not end with the original study, as they can be reused for further investigation if properly handled. Data become much more valuable when integrated with other data and information (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For example, traits, images, seed/sample sources, sequencing data and high-throughput phenotyping results become much more informative when integrated with germplasm accessions and pedigree data. Access to low-cost, high-throughput sequencing, large-scale phenotyping and advanced computational algorithms, combined with significant funding by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) for cyberinfrastructure and agricultural-related research have fueled the growth of databases to manage, store, integrate, analyse and serve these data and tools to scientists and other stakeholders.</p><p>To describe agricultural-related databases, we use the term &#x02018;GGB (genomic, genetic and breeding) database&#x02019;. GGB databases include any online resource that holds genomic, genetic, phenotypic and/or breeding-related information and that is organized via a database schema, and contained within a database management system (or DBMS, which is a computer application that manages and provides access to one or more types of database systems, including relational, Resource Description Framework (RDF), or nonrelational (noSQL) storage systems). GGB databases play a central role in the communities they serve by curating and distributing published data, by facilitating collaborations between scientists and by promoting awareness of what research is being done and by whom in the community. GGB databases prevent duplicated research efforts and foster communication and collaboration between laboratories (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As more and more organisms are sequenced, cross-species investigations become increasingly informative, requiring researchers to use multiple GGB databases and requiring that GGB databases share data and use compatible software tools. Use of common data standards, vocabularies, ontologies and tools will make curation more effective, promote data sharing and facilitate comparative studies (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>The AgBioData consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agbiodata.org">https://www.agbiodata.org</ext-link>) was formed in 2015 in response to the need for GGB personnel to work together to come up with better, more efficient database solutions. The mission of the consortium, comprised of members responsible for over 25 GGB databases and allied resources, is to work together to identify ways to consolidate and standardize common GGB database operations to create database products with more interoperability. Member databases and resources are listed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agbiodata.org/databases">https://www.agbiodata.org/databases</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fairsharing.org/collection/AgBioData">https://fairsharing.org/collection/AgBioData</ext-link>. The AgBioData consortium joins the larger scientific community in embracing the Findable, Accessible Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, established by stakeholders from the scientific, publishing and library communities (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). FAIR principles have rapidly become standard guidelines for proper data management, as they outline a roadmap to maximize data reuse across repositories. However, more specific guidelines on how to implement FAIR principles for agricultural GGB data are needed to assist and streamline implementation across GGB databases.</p><p>Members of the AgBioData consortium convened in Salt Lake City, UT on 18&#x000a0;&#x00026;&#x000a0;19&#x000a0;April 2017 to describe challenges and recommendations for seven topics relevant to GGB databases&#x02014;<bold>Biocuration, Ontologies, Metadata and persistence, GGB database platforms, Programmatic (Machine) access to data, Communication</bold> and <bold>Sustainability</bold>. Preceding this workshop, a survey was sent out to all AgBioData members regarding the seven topics, in order to identify concerns and challenges of AgBioData members. The results were used to focus and foster the workshop discussions. Here we present the current challenges facing GGBs in each of these seven areas and recommendations for best practices, incorporating discussions from the Salt Lake City meeting and results of the survey.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is 3-fold: first, to document the current challenges and opportunities of GGB databases and online resources regarding the collection, integration and provision of data in a standardized way; second, to outline a set of standards and best practices for GGB databases and their curators; and third, to inform policy and decision makers in the federal government, funding agencies, scientific publishers and academic institutions about the growing importance of scientific data curation and management to the research community. The paper is organized by the seven topics discussed at the Salt Lake City workshop. For each topic, we provide an overview, challenges and opportunities and recommendations. The acronym &#x02018;API&#x02019; (Application Programming Interface) appears frequently in this paper, referring to the means by which software components communicate with each other: i.e. a set of instructions and data transfer protocols.</p><p>We envision this paper will be helpful to scientists in the GGB database community, publishers, funders and policy makers and agricultural scientists who want to broaden their understanding of FAIR data practices.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Biocuration</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>Biocurators strive to present an accessible, accurate and comprehensive representation of biological knowledge (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Biocuration is the process of selecting and integrating biological knowledge, data and metadata within a structured database so that it can be accessible, understandable and reusable by the research community. Data and metadata are taken from peer-reviewed publications and other sources and integrated with other data to deliver a value-added product to the public for further research. Biocuration is a multidisciplinary effort that involves subject area experts, software developers, bioinformaticians and researchers. The curation process usually includes a mixture of manual, semi-automated and fully automated workflows.</p><p>Manual biocuration is the process of an expert reading one or several related publications, assessing and/or validating the quality of the data and entering data manually into a database using curation tools, or by providing spreadsheets to the database manager. It also encompasses the curation of facts or knowledge, in addition to raw data; for example, the role a gene plays in a particular pathway. These data include information on genes, proteins, DNA or RNA sequences, pathways, mutant and non-mutant phenotypes, mutant interactions, qualitative and quantitative traits, genetic variation, diversity and population data, genetic stocks, genetic maps, chromosomal information, genetic markers and any other information from the publication that the curator deems valuable to the database consumers. Manual curation includes determining and attaching appropriate ontology and metadata annotations to data. This sometimes requires interaction with authors to ensure data is represented correctly and completely, and indeed to ask where the data resides if they are not linked to a publication. In well-funded large GGB databases, manually curated data may be reviewed by one, two or even three additional curators.</p><p>Manual biocuration is perhaps the best way to curate data, but no GGB database has enough resources to curate all data manually. Moreover, the number of papers produced by each research community continues to grow rapidly. Thus, semi-automated and fully automated workflows are also used by most databases. For example, a species-specific database may want to retrieve all Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for genes and proteins for their species from a multi-species database like UniProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">http://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). In this case, a script might be written and used to retrieve that data &#x02018;en masse&#x02019;. Prediction of gene homologs, orthologs and function can also be automated. Some of these standard automated processes require intervention at defined points from expert scientist to choose appropriate references, cut off values, perform verifications and do quality checks. All biocuration aims to add value to data. Harvesting biological data from published literature, linking it to existing data and adding it to a database enables researchers to access the integrated data and use it to advance scientific knowledge.</p><p>The manual biocuration of genes, proteins and pathways in one or more species often leads to the development of algorithms and software tools that have wider applications and contribute to automated curation processes. For example, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org">https://www.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>) has been manually adding GO annotations to thousands of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes from the literature since 1999. This manual GO annotation is now the gold standard reference set for all other plant GO annotations and is used for inferring gene function of related sequences in all other plant species (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Another example is the manually curated metabolic pathways in Ecocyc, MetaCyc and PlantCyc, which have been used to predict genome-scale metabolic networks for several species based on gene sequence similarity (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The recently developed Plant Reactome database has further streamlined the process of orthology-based projections of plant pathways by creating simultaneous projections for 74 species. These projections are routinely updated along with the curated pathways from the Reactome reference species <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Without manual biocuration of experimental data from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice and other model organisms, the plant community would not have the powerful gene function prediction workflows we have today, nor would the development of the wide array of existing genomic resources and automated protocols have been possible. Biocurators continue to provide feedback to improve automated pipelines for prediction workflows (e.g. genome annotation, mapping etc.) and help to streamline data sets for their communities and/or add a value to the primary data. All biocuration is time consuming and requires assistance from expert biologists. Current efforts in machine learning and automated text mining to pull data or to rank journal articles for curation more effectively work to some extent, but so far these approaches are not able to synthesize a clear narrative and thus cannot yet replace biocurators. The manual curation of literature, genes, proteins, pathways etc. by expert biologists remains the gold standard used for developing and testing text mining tools and other automated workflows. We expect that although text-mining tools will help biocurators achieve higher efficiency, biocurators will remain indispensable to ensure accuracy and relevance of biological data.</p><p>Well-curated GGB databases play an important role in the data lifecycle by facilitating dissemination and reuse. GGB databases can increase researchers&#x02019; efficiency, increase the return on research funding investment by maximizing reuse and provide use metrics for those who desire to quantify research impact. We anticipate that the demand for biocurators will increase as the tsunami of &#x02018;big data&#x02019; continues. Despite the fact that the actual cost of data curation is estimated to be less than 0.1% of the cost of the research that generated primary data (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), data curation remains underfunded (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><sec id="sec4a"><title>Biocuration is not keeping pace with research and the generation of data</title><p>Databases are focused on serving the varied needs of their stakeholders. Because of this, different GGB databases may curate different data types or curate similar data types to varying depths, and are likely to be duplicating efforts to streamline curation. In addition, limited resources for most GGB databases often prevent timely curation of the rapidly growing data in publications.</p></sec><sec id="sec4aa"><title>Researchers use many different databases in their work</title><p>We recognize there is a clear need for databases that are tailored for the communities that they serve. For example, SoyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.soybase.org">https://www.soybase.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) primarily focuses on resources and tools for soybean breeding, while TAIR (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) focuses on gene function for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> research community. However, as more organism genomes are sequenced, comparisons between and among species become more biologically informative. Multi-organism databases like Gramene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gramene.org">www.gramene.org</ext-link>) and Phytozome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov">https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov</ext-link>), Planteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.planteome.org">www.planteome.org</ext-link>) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)&#x02019;s gene Expression Atlas (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) etc. provide resources for comparative genomics studies and link data types from various public databases including species-specific databases. This means that researchers now increasingly have access to several different databases and benefit from their cross-referencing to compare data across species. Use of common data standards, vocabularies, ontologies and tools will not only make curation and data sharing more effective, but will also make databases easier to use.</p></sec><sec id="sec4b"><title>Training of data generators in data management skills is poor</title><p>Since data management has not traditionally been a part of scientific training, the awareness of the importance of data management is not widespread and the training resources are scarce. As a result, data management by data generators is often insufficient and can result in loss of crucial data as well as the associated metadata. With proper training, and a well-crafted data management plan, researchers can increase the value and reproducibility of their research and ultimately increase the importance of their contribution to science.</p></sec><sec id="sec4ba"><title>Community curation is still in its infancy</title><p>Meeting the increased need for biocuration will require engagement by the scientific community, however, to date, community curation has not been widely embraced by data generators. Data entry tools where they exist, may be difficult to learn, and graduate students and postdocs may have little motivation or time to curate. To increase community curation at this time, biocurators will need to educate researchers, funders and publishers of the need for publicly sharing accurate research data in reusable forms (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Crowdsourcing shows promise, but is still new (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4bc"><title>Training for biocurators</title><p>We anticipate that the demand for biocurators will increase as the tsunami of &#x02018;big data&#x02019; continues. Biocurators need a certain set of skills in both computational methods and biological expertise in their chosen area. The University of Cambridge has just launched a new program leading to a Postgraduate Certificate in Biocuration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/course/postgraduate-certificate-biocuration">https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/course/postgraduate-certificate-biocuration</ext-link>), but there are no graduate programs in biocuration that we are aware of.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Recommendations</title><sec id="sec5a"><title>Developing AgBioData standards of curation</title><p>One reason for establishing the AgBioData group was to provide a forum to share curation methods from different GGB databases in order to improve and streamline the process. Although the demand for data curation accelerates while resources for biocuration remain limited, by working together, we reduce redundancy and continually improve our curation methods. Each GGB database is responsible for selecting data and providing consistent curation based on the needs of its users. However, the use of curation standards will increase consistency across databases and promote efficiency and interoperability. To move toward more standard biocuration methods, we recommend the following practices:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold>Continue regular communication between biocurators of different databases</bold>. AgBioData holds monthly conference calls that frequently include discussions on curation issues or reports on biocuration projects from within the AgBioData group and from outside groups. AgBioData also encourages member participation and interaction with the broader (non-agricultural) biocuration community, such as with the International Society for Biocuration.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Adopt existing or contribute to developing new Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations recommendations for each curated data type.</bold> As minimal data and metadata recommendations are established, AgBioData will provide this information to researchers, funders and publishers through publications and seminars, and will strongly encourage their consistent use. These recommendations will also be provided via appropriate online resources such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://AgBioData.org">AgBioData.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://FAIRsharing.org">FAIRsharing.org</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Share data curation templates.</bold> Many biocurators develop and use template spreadsheets for data collection from literature. At MaizeGDB (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), for example, templates have been used to ensure consistency between curators and to ease loading of curated data. Database biocurators who have expertise in curation of certain data types are encouraged to share their data templates and curation guidelines through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://AgBioData.org">AgBioData.org</ext-link>. These expert templates and guidelines can be adopted for use by other GGB databases as needed. Sharing templates will also support communities in the process of establishing a new database, as they will not have to reinvent curation best practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Recommend that funding agencies require data and metadata submission to public resources as a requirement for funding.</bold> Funding agencies should hold grantees accountable by requiring proof of proper data submissions to a public resource. GGB databases can help by including funding sources and grant IDs in the metadata.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Recommend that publishers require data and metadata submission to public resource as a requirement for publication</bold>. Publishers should require authors to submit to archival resources and require proof of proper data submission to public resources before publication. This was very successful in the early stages of establishing the submission of germplasm to the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center or requiring GenBank IDs for any sequence. GGB databases can help by providing best practices and support for ingestion of these data sets.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Databases should encourage and facilitate use of persistent digital identifiers by data generators.</bold> Consistent use of unique Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) or Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) will reduce errors in referring to data sets within and across different GGB databases.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Report errors and omissions of data to authors, editors, databases and publishers.</bold> A reporting system that curators can use to notify the authors and journal editors when a paper with missing data or metadata is discovered will help ensure proper data dissemination. Encouraging researchers to provide feedback to GGB databases when they find errors or omissions is important as well.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Work toward increasing the visibility of biocurators and what they contribute to the research community.</bold> Many scientists do not know the amount of work, and manual curation, that is needed to maintain a community database. Educating the users of community GGB databases, and the people behind them, could go a long way to encourage proper data submission.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Provide training for researchers on responsible data management.</bold> Tutorials covering all aspects of data management, including file formats, the collection and publishing of high value metadata along with data, interacting with GGB databases, how to attach a license to your data, how to ensure your data stays with your publication and more will be useful training tools. This information can be presented as short online videos or FAQs and as live presentations to researchers. Encouraging collaborations between biocurators and educators to integrate data management and stewardship strategies into graduate and undergraduate course materials allows for the training of the next generation of scientists in responsible data management practices. Course work of this type can be developed in collaboration with institutional librarians who have a similar mission to provide training in data stewardship.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Provide post-graduate training in biocuration.</bold> Biocurators need both computation skills and biological expertise. We strongly encourage development of programs for biocurators and the training of graduate students in biocuration.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ontologies</title><sec id="sec7"><title>Overview</title><p>The size and the complexity of biological data resulting from recent technological advances require the data to be stored in computable or standardized form for efficient integration and retrieval. Use of ontologies to annotate data is important for integrating disparate data sets. Ontologies are structured, controlled vocabularies (CVs) that represent specific knowledge domains (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Examples include the GO (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) for attributes of gene products such as subcellular localization, molecular function or biological role, and Plant Ontology (PO) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref>) for plant attributes such as developmental stages or anatomical parts. When data are associated with appropriate ontology terms, data interoperability, retrieval and transfer are more effective. In this section, we review the challenges and opportunities in the use of ontologies and provide a set of recommendations for data curation with ontologies.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>To identify current status and challenges in ontology use, an online survey was offered to AgBioData members.

In addition, with a few exceptions, these terms are assigned through computation instead of through rigorous manual annotation.

The curation work could be somewhat eased by tools for the curation and validation of annotations and by standardized data formats for ontology annotation data exchange. Significant work has been done in these areas. The curation tools for GO annotation include TAIR&#x02019;s in-house curation tool PubSearch (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and TAIR&#x02019;s community portal the Online Annotation Submission Tool (TOAST) (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), PomBase&#x02019;s Canto (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), the GO consortium&#x02019;s Noctua (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://noctua.berkeleybop.org/">http://noctua.berkeleybop.org</ext-link>) and Table Editor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/table-editor">http://bit.ly/table-editor</ext-link>) (<xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To facilitate sharing annotations among resources, there are some existing and emergent standards for ontology annotation data exchange. The GO Annotation File (GAF) format is the standard for GO annotation data exchange (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-format-20">http://geneontology.org/page/go-annotation-file-format-20</ext-link>) and Phenopackets (Phenotype Exchange Format or PFX; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-format/wiki/Overview-of-Phenotype-Exchange-Format">https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-format/wiki/Overview-of-Phenotype-Exchange-Format</ext-link>) is an extensible data model and data exchange format for phenotype data from any species (<xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

When using in-house ontologies, it is necessary to map their terms to reference ontologies to facilitate ontology development and/or data transfer among other databases. In addition, it is often necessary to use species-specific ontologies. For example, analogous organs across plant species often do not have the same name. To ease this difficulty, the CO and Planteome projects work together to link terms in plant species-specific ontologies to more general terms in references ontologies like GO and PO. In case of incomplete ontologies, there is a need for a tool or system where researchers and biocurators can add terms, which are timely reviewed for inclusion in the ontologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Based on the challenges we identified, we provide the following recommendations.</p><sec id="sec9a"><title>Use ontologies in data curation</title><p>The core recommended set of ontologies to use for agricultural is GO for gene function annotation, Sequence Ontology (SO) to define sequence types and trait ontologies for Quantitative trait locus (QTL), heritable phenotypic markers, gene models, transcripts, germplasm, molecular markers and trait descriptors for breeding and/or diversity projects.</p><p>PO and TO are recommended for describing plant anatomy, developmental stages of plants and plant traits.

For describing traits, the Vertebrate Trait Ontology (VT) provides trait descriptors analogous to TO for plants. The Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA) is a Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO)-based ontology that provides traits in a completely species-neutral way, and integrates with VT and TO. The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology describes abnormal effects of gene mutations and other phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="sec10a"><title>Make methods transparent to researchers when computational annotation is done instead of manual curation</title><p>Manual and rigorous ontology annotation is recommended. When manual curation is not practical due to lack of curation time, we recommend computational approaches for automatic association of GO or PO terms using the rigorously curated ontology associations from &#x02018;Model&#x02019; species based on previously established gene orthology relationships. The Ensembl project (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) produces orthology relationships among a number of plant species in Ensembl-plant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plants.ensembl.org">http://plants.ensembl.org</ext-link>) as does the InParanoid project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se">http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se</ext-link>). Gene family groupings can also be used to infer orthology. A number of gene families have been produced by various groups such as Panther (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org">pantherdb.org</ext-link>) and Pfam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org">http://pfam.xfam.org</ext-link>). Once gene families are developed for a species vis-&#x000e0;-vis an appropriate model organism, these families, along with GAFs could be used to transfer GO as well as TO annotations between GGB databases with modest curatorial resources by simple identifier matching algorithms. As is common practice, sequence similarity to gene models from model organisms can also be used in GO annotation. It is important, however, to check the computational method and make it transparent to the users.</p></sec><sec id="sec10ab"><title>Make an effort to create a network of ontologies as a community</title><p>In order to provide unified access to different types of agricultural data and enable large-scale analysis, it is crucial to have a network of domain ontologies. Each ontology focuses on its own domain, but often several ontologies are needed to fully describe the data. The OBO Foundry initiative (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) provides a variety of tools including an ontology import feature. As an example of the creation of an ontology network, TO defines phenotypic traits in plants as Entity&#x02013;Quality (EQ) statements. The quality (Q) terms come from the PATO whereas the entity (E) terms come from PO, GO or ChEBI, depending on the entity. These efforts can reduce the curation time in individual databases since once the data is curated with one ontology such as TO, it can be further associated with other component ontologies. There are also tools to make relationships among reference ontologies. One example is Intelligent Concept Assistant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/INCATools/intelligent-concept-assistant">https://github.com/INCATools/intelligent-concept-assistant</ext-link>), a National Institute of Health (NIH) Big Data 2 Knowledge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k">https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k</ext-link>)-funded project to develop an environment for helping scientists to collaboratively create, extend and apply their knowledge to describe and interpret biomedical data sets.</p></sec><sec id="sec10ac"><title>Facilitate ontology annotation by data generators</title><p>We encourage the use of ontologies by implementing rules and procedures where available/applicable, and improving ontologies by enlisting community helps in adding new terms, correcting existing terms as needed and in general, modifying ontologies to be broadly adaptive. A good example of this process occurs in AnimalQTLdb, where ontologies were developed in parallel with improvements to AnimalQTLdb (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>One way to encourage researchers to use ontologies is to provide a system that requires collection of accepted ontology terms as part of the data and/or publication submission process. Some databases, such as TAIR, TreeGenes (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and GDR work with journals to require that authors submit their data to the appropriate GGB database prior to manuscript submission (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). There are multiple approaches to this. GDR has downloadable data templates that researchers fill in and submit. TreeGenes has a web form for submitting association genetics and population genomics studies. TreeGene&#x02019;s web form is currently being converted to a Tripal module (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), with the aim of fully adopting Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) to include the full spectrum of data generation, including design, sampling, sequencing and informatic analysis. The TreeGene system simplifies the submission process through the use of guided prompts to query researcher for the location of the experiment (i.e. latitude, longitude, altitude), the type of experiment (e.g. common garden, reciprocal transplant) and environmental conditions (e.g. average temperature), and to determine which ontologies are necessary. TAIR&#x02019;s TOAST (18; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://toast.arabidopsis.org">https://toast.arabidopsis.org</ext-link>/) allows authors to submit GO and PO annotations for their own or for others&#x02019; published works.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Metadata and persistence</title><sec id="sec11"><title>Overview</title><p>Public data is valuable for additional research and for reproducibility analyses. But data cannot be reused unless they are sufficiently described, including attribution, analysis methods, procedures, data formats and a description of the subjects and treatments. Data cannot be reused if they cannot be found via search engines or persistent identifiers.</p><p>Take the data resulting from a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) as an example. The accompanying metadata should include the species and specific individuals that were sampled; the study participants and publication; the genotypes and phenotypes and how they are obtained; the name, versions and parameters of software used; any scripts developed; parameters used to define significance; and data formats. Not only does this enable researchers to reuse data that may have been produced at considerable expense, but also enables researchers to reproduce results (a particular matter of concern in recent years, given the need for improving trust in the scientific process). Furthermore, having a persistent identifier attached to this data set, and having it deposited in a permanent repository, ensures that it can be found, retrieved and reused by multiple researchers for years to come.</p><p>Metadata is descriptive information about an object or resource whether it be physical or electronic. The underlying concepts behind metadata have been in use for as long as collections of information have been organized. Library card catalogs represent a well-established type of metadata that have served as collection management and resource discovery tools for decades.</p><p>A metadata standard can be either a set of core descriptors that will apply in all instances and extended as needed or a comprehensive standard consisting of both required and optional data fields. The advantage of a core set is that its simplicity can greatly aid its adoption. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) is an example of a core standard. For description of data sets, a more comprehensive standard would be <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/">https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/</ext-link>. For scientific research data, a &#x02018;core standard&#x02019; will not be adequate to describe how the data was generated and analysed. Extensions to a &#x02018;core standard&#x02019; are by definition, not standardized and so, extended fields likely cannot be compared. A &#x02018;comprehensive standard&#x02019;, on the other hand, may provide sufficient descriptive fields to enable reuse of research data, but its complexity may create a significant barrier to adoption. Another dimension of a metadata standard is the use of CVs. To compare metadata for multiple data sets, there must be a means of directly comparing the contents of each field. CVs, especially in the form of a hierarchical ontology that contains information about the relatedness of values, are essential to metadata.</p><p>Metadata is critical to enabling each of the four FAIR principles.

The sequence data itself is maintained elsewhere, typically in an INSDC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec12"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>For all the importance of metadata, there are several explanations for why it is often neglected.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Development of metadata standards is very difficult, requiring consensus and agreement across multiple groups, and requires a governing body to drive the process, manage the standards and encourage or enforce adoption.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Collection and curation of adequate metadata is also difficult and time consuming for both data curators and researchers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Researchers often cannot see the value of thorough metadata and therefore are unwilling to take the time to provide it, or assume the paper &#x02018;is&#x02019; the metadata.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Understaffed repositories may make metadata collection a low priority due to its effort and perceived lack of value.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, even if a standard exists and a researcher or repository is willing to provide metadata, the appropriate standards can be difficult to find and are often unwieldy; many of the data fields are likely to be irrelevant to a particular data set, repository or study type. Often custom metadata is used, which, although better than no metadata, make it difficult or impossible to search across or compare data sets.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Another challenge is how to permanently attach metadata to data sets to make them discoverable. Too often the meaning of files is implicit in a directory structure, e.g. version number, which is typically lost when files are shared. README files can go missing, file names are changed or provenance is mentioned in a long ago deleted e-mail. This implies that not only is data persistence important but its metadata must also be persistent and permanently attached. Examples of persistent identifiers attached to metadata are GenBank's BioProject and BioSample records that describe genomic, genotypic and expression data deposited at GenBank (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Also, DOIs (see https://www.doi.org/index.html) and ARKs (see http://n2t.net/e/ark_ids.html) are associated with defined metadata (<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). A recent paper (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and related blog post (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2017/07/06/bad-identifiers-potholes-of-information-superhighway">http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2017/07/06/bad-identifiers-potholes-of-information-superhighway/</ext-link>) emphasize the importance of choosing unique identifiers for data sets and for objects within data sets.</p></sec><sec id="sec13"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Our main concerns for metadata are the following: use of persistent identifiers; encouraging and enforcing the use of standard and effective metadata; proliferation and duplication of standards development, including frequent use of custom metadata that can't be compared outside a specific GGB database or data set; the difficulty of choosing among large numbers of recommendations and creating profiles to meet specific needs; and the difficulty of filling in extensive metadata forms. To address these concerns, we recommend that researchers and GGB database curators:</p><sec><title>Work with librarians</title><p>at local institutions for training and to help develop data management plans that include collection of appropriate metadata.</p></sec><sec><title>Curate data and metadata</title><p>Manual curation is vital for GGB databases. Without curation, data sets cannot be integrated or interoperable, and valuable knowledge would remain in free-text form in the literature. Curation is multi-faceted and includes applying appropriate metadata, mapping to standard identifiers and extracting structured knowledge from the literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Use what already exists, collaborate with existing groups</title><p>The current metadata landscape is complex and varied as many groups attempt to solve the problem anew.

It will be difficult or impossible to find and collaborate with everyone working on metadata, but a network will help to encourage collaboration and to raise visibility of the metadata issue. This network will help newcomers understand who is doing what. The situation now is bewildering to someone trying to use metadata correctly. FAIRSharing, COPO and CyVerse are expected to be good partners in the task of disentangling overlapping standards, protocols and tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Improve database compliance</title><p>Each GGB database should require metadata for data sets they host.

This need was identified early on with the advent of whole-genome sequencing. Several tools and database schemas were developed to meet the needs of GGB databases, including AceDB in 1989 for the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome (<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), which was adopted by and modified for other projects; NCBI Entrez (<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) released as an online resource in 1993; Ensembl (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) in 1999; the UCSC genome browser (<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) in 2000; Gadfly for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) in 2003; AtDB/Illustra in 2003, followed by TAIR (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; and the Genomics Unified Schema, released in 2005 for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). For germplasm, the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN)-Global platform was initiated in 2009 (<xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and has since been adopted internationally for other genebanks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.grin-global.org/">www.grin-global.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>With low-cost next-generation sequencing technologies, generating genome assemblies is now possible for organisms with smaller research communities and fewer resources. In addition, technologies enabling high-throughput phenotyping can generate large data sets that would benefit from being linked to genomic and genetic data for the same individuals and species. In light of these technological advances, genome-centric databases tailored toward smaller communities, and across multiple taxa, have proliferated (<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), and several models for storing and accessing data have become adopted.</p><p>Here, we focus on platforms for community databases centered around GGB information. We define a &#x02018;platform&#x02019; as the database schema and software that serves biological information to researchers. GGB information is usually stored in a database schema, contained within a DBMS (e.g. a relational DBMS like MySQL, a triplestore system like RDF or other noSQL DBMS such as HDF5 and Neo4j) and accessible for outside use via an application that interfaces with the DBMS.</p><sec id="sec16"><title>Review of available platforms</title><p>There are multiple platforms currently available for building GGB databases. Here we review several platforms: three that are well established and three newer platforms that show promise. The criteria for selecting these platforms are the following:

<bold>Well-established platforms: Tripal plus Chado</bold>
</p><p>Tripal (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) is a freely available, open-source platform for building community-focused, biological data web portals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tripal.info">http://tripal.info</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tripal/tripal">https://github.com/tripal/tripal</ext-link>; GNU General Public License v2+), and is currently in use by many plant and animal genome databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tripal.info/sites_using_tripal">http://tripal.info/sites_using_tripal</ext-link>). Tripal extends Drupal, a popular content management system, to provide a robust, modular platform with a powerful administrative user interface, extensive developer APIs and advanced website functionality. Biological data is stored in the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) Chado database schema (<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) that provides flexible, ontology-driven storage for most biologically relevant data types. Paired with PostgreSQL, Tripal and Chado provide high data integrity while the Drupal Storage API provides the flexibility to use alternative storage solutions when necessary. Rather than providing a data warehouse, Tripal focuses on building full community web portals with integrated biological data storage.</p><p>Installation of Drupal and Tripal is extremely well documented and includes an automated portion guiding the administrator through the initial setup and basic configuration. This makes the basic setup of a Tripal site extremely easy. The process does, however, become more complicated once data loading and configuration of extensions begin due to the large number of options available. Another area that can be overwhelming is the extensive combined Drupal/Tripal Developer API that allows site developers to customize every aspect of a Tripal site. This API is a huge advantage insofar as it ensures that anyone can customize a given aspect or add a given feature; however, its size and complexity can overwhelm developers new to the platforms. Luckily, it is well documented with many tutorials, and Tripal has an active, helpful developer community (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tripal.info/support">http://tripal.info/support</ext-link>). However, it is important to keep in mind there will be a learning curve for even an experienced PHP developer.</p><p>The GMOD Chado schema is another area of complexity. In order to achieve flexibility, Chado is a normalized schema divided into modules by data type. Each module typically has one or more base tables with minimal fields, extendable by property tables, and a set of linker tables to tie data objects together. This allows Chado to support data types that did not exist during the design phase, but also results in the need for many table joins to extract the data for dissemination. Since queries with a large number of joins can be a performance issue, custom indexes and materialized views are often used; however, this results in data duplication and increases database size. Overall, Tripal&#x02019;s many features, extensions and customizations paired with its active developer community make the investment to evaluate this platform well worth it.</p><p>
<bold>Well-established platforms: InterMine</bold>
</p><p>InterMine is an open-source data warehousing system that was originally developed for FlyMine (<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), and now has become widely used for other model organism databases (<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71&#x02013;77</xref>). The InterMOD consortium, a collaboration that includes the development teams for InterMine and five model organism databases, has worked to provide a platform for cross-species analyses through FlyMine, MouseMine, RatMine, ZebrafishMine, YeastMine and WormMine (<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). InterMine is increasingly being used for organisms important to agriculture, e.g. MedicMine (<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) for Medicago truncatula, HymenopteraMine (<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), BovineMine (<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) and others.</p><p>Advantages of InterMine are the following: (i) it enables the integration and fast mining of large complex data sets; (ii) the database schema is customizable; (iii) data can be accessed via the InterMine web application and custom applications; (iv) the InterMine system includes a collection of parsers (28 parsers as of 2013) (<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) to load data from typical data sources; and (v) InterMine includes an identifier resolver system to address issues that emerge due to changing identifiers for updated gene models. InterMine is not designed for incremental data entry or for data curation. Furthermore, the schema denormalization that enables high query performance can be a disadvantage for storing primary genome and annotation data because data integrity cannot be enforced when the database is denormalized. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a model organism database to employ both InterMine for data mining and a different schema, such as Chado, for storing primary genome and annotation data sets.</p><p>In deciding whether to use InterMine, one should consider the diversity of data available for a species and whether users would benefit from integrating the genome assembly and primary annotation with other data types. It may not be worthwhile to set up InterMine for a newly sequenced organism, unless a more established model organism can be leveraged via orthology. InterMine is suitable for integrating gene sets of non-model organisms with orthologs in model organisms and the additional information connected to the model organism genes, such as pathways and gene interactions.</p><p>The core of the InterMine platform is an object/relational mapping system, the ObjectStore, which is optimized for read-only database performance. It accepts queries from a client and generates SQL statements, which are optimized by a Query Optimizer and executed in the underlying database. The Query Optimizer enables high performance by automatic denormalization, i.e. the generation of pre-computed tables of connected data after all data is loaded. Data can be accessed through Representational State Transfer (RESTful) web services and the InterMine web application. Client library support is provided in Python, Perl, Java, Javascript and Ruby. InterMine relies on the SO as its core biological model.</p><p>The InterMine platform is well documented with tutorials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest">http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest</ext-link>) for configuring and setting up an instance. The InterMine Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://registry.intermine.org">http://registry.intermine.org</ext-link>) improves visibility of existing instances of InterMine while the InterMine Blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://intermineorg.wordpress.com">https://intermineorg.wordpress.com</ext-link>) updates the community on its development roadmap and future releases. Researchers can contact developers and the community at large via the GMOD InterMine mailing list or via Discord. The codebase for InterMine is available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/intermine/intermine">https://github.com/intermine/intermine</ext-link>), which also has an issue tracker for requesting features, raising issues and development-related discussions.</p><p>
<bold>Well-established platforms: Germinate</bold>
</p><p>Germinate is an open-source platform (BSD 2-Clause License) designed for storage and access of data related to genetic resource collections (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/">https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/</ext-link>; 79, 83). The Germinate platform supports data types relevant to genetic resource management, including phenotypic, genetic, geographic, pedigree, field trial and &#x02018;passport&#x02019; metadata. There are various methods for data display available, and the platform was designed to be extensible. The latest version is implemented in the Java-based Google Web Toolkit and MySQL. The platform is well documented (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/svn/germinate3/trunk/documentation/germinate-documentation.pdf">http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/svn/germinate3/trunk/documentation/germinate-documentation.pdf</ext-link>), with a Docker image available. The project does not have a public issue tracker, but comments and queries can be submitted to <email xlink:href="mailto:germinate@hutton.ac.uk">germinate@hutton.ac.uk</email>.</p><p>The Germinate platform is tailored toward breeding collections, and therefore is not a good fit for a database that is more sequence-centric (e.g. genomes and their annotations). However, for breeding and genetic resource data, the platform is well documented with fairly fast performance for a variety of project sizes, and nice visualizations of a variety of data types. The platform is compliant with the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors standard developed by the Food and Agriculture organization. If new data types that are not covered by the current schema implementation need to be stored, it should be possible to add new subschemata.</p><p>
<bold>Promising platforms: GenomeHubs from Ensembl</bold>
</p><p>Ensembl is a well-established system to analyse, store and access genomic data sets (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Ensembl websites provide a consistent user interface to access genomic data. Examples include Gramene (<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) and Ensembl Plants (<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>) for plants across taxonomic clades and Ensembl (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) for vertebrates. However, the challenge of installing the Ensembl system and loading data into the database has discouraged many GGB databases from adopting the Ensembl database schema and/or codebase. GenomeHubs was developed to ease adoption of Ensembl (<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). GenomeHubs is open source, provides a containerized setup of the Ensembl database schema and webserver and offers scripts to load genomic data into the database. GenomeHubs provides detailed documentation on its website, and user support is available via GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs/issues">https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs/issues</ext-link>). While fairly new, GenomeHubs already represents a promising path to democratize access to the Ensembl system for most genome projects. Because the Ensembl schema is primarily sequence-centric, this platform may not be a good fit for breeding data.</p><p>
<bold>Promising platforms: Sol Genomics Network</bold>
</p><p>The Sol Genomics Network (SGN, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://solgenomics.net">https://solgenomics.net</ext-link>) is a web portal for sequence and phenotype data, as well as a variety of analysis tools (<xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). This open-source platform (MIT license) is currently tailored toward plants in the family Solanaceae, and has been expanded to a comprehensive breeding management system emphasizing next-generation breeding technologies, such as genomic selection. GGB databases that use this platform include Cassava (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cassavabase.org">https://cassavabase.org</ext-link>), yam (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yambase.org">https://yambase.org</ext-link>), sweet potato (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sweetpotatobase.org">https://sweetpotatobase.org</ext-link>) and banana (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://musabase.org">https://musabase.org</ext-link>). Another implementation of the SGN platform is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://citrusgreening.org">https://citrusgreening.org</ext-link>, which focuses on interactions of host, vector and pathogen. SGN is recommended especially for communities that produce both sequence and phenotypic data for breeding programs. A standalone installation is available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/solgenomics/solbase">https://github.com/solgenomics/solbase</ext-link>). SGN staff is happy to provide technical support for prospective adopters.</p><p>
<bold>Promising platforms: T3</bold>
</p><p>T3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://triticeaetoolbox.org">https://triticeaetoolbox.org</ext-link>) is a database and website designed to enable plant breeders and researchers to combine, visualize and query phenotype and genotype data across contributing plant breeding programs (<xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Data is loaded using Microsoft Excel or text file data templates. There are data templates for importing germplasm lines, trial means, plot-level results, field layout and canopy spectral reflectance. Analysis tools integrated into the website include GWAS, Genomic Prediction, Selection Index and statistical reports. T3 enables users to define data sets for download in formats compatible with external tools such as TASSEL, Flapjack and R. T3 is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TriticeaeToolbox/T3">https://github.com/TriticeaeToolbox/T3</ext-link>, and installation instructions are posted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat/docs/INSTALL.html">https://triticeaetoolbox.org/wheat/docs/INSTALL.html</ext-link>. A typical installation includes a sandbox server used for testing imports and a production server that is used for public access.</p><p>
<bold>Promising platforms: Reactome</bold>
</p><p>Reactome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reactome.org">https://reactome.org</ext-link>) is an open-source, open access, intuitive platform for the visualization, interpretation and analysis of pathways (<xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Reactome supports manual curation of reactions and pathways, using appropriate ontologies, and cross-references to other public resources, including NCBI, Ensembl, UniProt, ChEBI and PubMed. The Reactome platform was initially developed for human pathways and was later extended to pathways for several other organisms, including cattle (<italic>Bos taurus)</italic>, chicken <italic>(Gallus gallus),</italic> dog <italic>(Canis familiaris)</italic> and swine <italic>(Sus scrofa).</italic> Software and instructions for installation of the Reactome database, website and data entry tools are available for independent pathway curation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/reactome">https://github.com/reactome</ext-link>). Recent developments at Reactome have led to adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) and a new ContentService (REST API) to build the query system (<xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). The Gramene database adopted the Reactome data model and platform to create the Plant Reactome portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plants.reactome.org">http://plants.reactome.org</ext-link>), which currently hosts a collection of plant pathways from 75 species (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec17"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>
<bold>Platform choice.</bold> Often, GGB databases are focused on information pertaining to a single species or a single clade. While general-purpose databases and repositories do exist and should be used, in particular for sequence data, community databases fulfill needs specific to non-model organisms, often with a unique set of data types. These needs can include non-genetic or genomic data types (e.g. phenotypic data); expert or community curation of gene models; pathway databases; metadata and ontologies tailored toward a particular community or research focus; detailed queries of the data; community interactions regarding the data; and means for finding all data within a taxonomic group. Since GGB databases are built to meet specific needs of their community, the requirements for infrastructure and software can vary widely, even though multiple communities would benefit from shared platforms. Not only do the requirements for infrastructure and software vary among GGB databases, GGB databases also need to continuously update their platforms to accommodate new types of data generated from new technologies.</p><p>
<bold>Platform sustainability.</bold> It is common that GGB databases need to be built in a short time, with no prospect of continued funding. Building and maintaining a platform for GGB databases is a challenging task due to the complexity and the volume of the data, requiring extensive collaboration between experienced programmers, database/system administrators and researchers, especially when the GGB database is built from scratch. Sustaining a GGB platform over time is therefore a challenge.</p><p>
<bold>Platform interoperability.</bold> GGB databases use a diversity of database schemas, many employing existing platforms, custom-built solutions or a combination of both. The diversity of platforms used can pose challenges for data exchange and interoperability among databases.</p></sec><sec id="sec18"><title>Recommendations</title><sec id="sec19"><title>Recommendations for platform choice</title><p>
<bold>Things to consider before choosing a platform.</bold>
</p><p>First, the developers need to have a good understanding of the data that will be stored in their community resources, and have a plan for how the data will be discovered and transferred. This includes understanding the data types and their associated metadata, as well as the relationship between different types of data. The developers also need to know whether the data are standardized by the producers and what additional standards will need to be applied to maintain full data integrity. This should encompass versioning, naming, metadata standards and ontologies. (Recommendations for all of these are covered in significant depth elsewhere in this document.) Additionally, the developers will need to plan ahead for appropriate data capacity, considering both the total size of the target data set to start and how fast the data is expected to grow. This can be difficult to accurately predict&#x02014;the existing data in flat files may expand significantly when moved into a relational database, and advances in instrumentation that lead to huge increases in data production are common. We recommend looking at past trends, talking to leading minds in the field and running tests of storage solutions to make these decisions, then leaving significant extra capacity on top of the best predictions.</p><p>Beyond the data, it is critical to develop a clear picture of researchers and their needs. Researchers may have a variety of roles, each of which must be considered separately. In each of these roles, researchers may have different needs for downloading, visualizing, searching, editing, analyzing or otherwise interacting with each data type. Further, these roles may span different expertise levels, from new users and students to power users who run complex and sophisticated analyses. To develop a clear understanding of the researchers and the tools needed, use cases are a powerful tool and are highly recommended.</p><p>Next, the local resources and the development environment need to be considered. How much development capacity is available? The number of available developers, including local IT professionals, their expertise, along with the timeframe for development, informs the scope of what can be successfully delivered. If funding is short term, a long-term plan for maintenance and sustainability may need to be developed. In this case, an open source solution may be particularly attractive, to enable later development and maintenance by different developers.</p><p>Hosting services vs. hardware administration and backups, while outside the scope of this document, are also critical considerations. Further, a thorough understanding of local policies is critical for initial decision making. The local institution, the funding agency and the data itself may have licences, ownership and other conditions that need to be thoroughly understood.</p><p>
<bold>Systematically choose from available platforms.</bold>
<xref rid="TB5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> represents a guide to selecting from the available platforms listed above. This table objectively compares the data support for these platforms. The intent of this table is to allow readers to prioritize the platforms that have at least schema support for specific data types.</p><p>Consider the following example: a research community has decided to fund a community resource to house a recent genome assembly, including annotation, as well as a collection of genotypic and phenotypic data for a core set of germplasm. Their highest priority is a platform that will handle genome assemblies, gene annotation and genotypic and phenotypic data. The genotypic and phenotypic data includes a number of bi-parental crosses and, as such, it is likely that the community will also want to store genetic maps and QTL data in the future. According to <xref rid="TB5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, both Tripal and InterMine support these data types, making these platforms worth considering further.</p><p>In addition to supporting different data types, platforms come with different built-in feature. <xref rid="TB6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> compares features provided by the reviewed platforms. Rather than considering all the features and choosing the most feature-rich platform, it is recommended to focus on the features important to the platform&#x02019;s intended users. Considering the previous example, this may have the following prioritized feature list: (i) community-building tools; (ii) easy search functionality; (iii) genome browser and BLAST; (iv) GWAS visualizations such as Manhattan plots; and (v) advanced querying for a subset of users. <xref rid="TB6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> shows that both Tripal and InterMine provide easy search functionality, genome browser and BLAST integration. However, Tripal excels at community-building tools, whereas InterMine excels at advanced querying. This example highlights that the best solution might be a collection of platforms depending on how diverse the users&#x02019; needs are. Finally, consider the last feature, GWAS visualizations, which is not included in <xref rid="TB6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Remember that if a given platform does not include an important feature, it is always worth contacting the developer. They are often happy to receive feedback and may even be in the process of implementing new features of interest. Furthermore, keep in mind that it will require less development to add a feature to an existing platform than it will be to develop a new platform.
<table-wrap id="TB6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Feature sets supported by each GGB platform.

<bold>Use open-source tools if possible</bold> (<xref rid="ref91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). If open source tools do not perfectly meet the need, we recommend reaching out to and collaborating with tool developers to see how database needs can be integrated with existing efforts. Federal funding agencies such as the NSF and USDA have encouraged developers to build on each other&#x02019;s work and thus multiply the scope and impact of their efforts through shared code. If you develop your own tools, publish your code and documentation in a public hosting service such as GitHub, BitBucket or SourceForge.</p><p>
<bold>Have a plan for long-term management.</bold> Things to consider are how the resource will be maintained when no funding is available, what open-source tools would make it easier for long-term maintenance with little funding and what hardware resources are needed in the future. For long-term maintenance, databases built on shared platforms could be (more) easily integrated and potentially maintained at a lower cost.</p></sec><sec id="sec21"><title>Recommendations for platform interoperability</title><p>
<bold>Employ ontologies and CVs and use them to annotate as much data as possible.</bold> Where community-derived CVs are not available, we recommend reaching out to others before creating custom vocabularies. When custom vocabularies are needed, it is best to design them with the intent to either submit them for inclusion in an existing vocabulary or make them publicly available.</p><p>
<bold>Plan for web services.</bold> We recommend using web service APIs that are already widely adopted, for example the Breeding API (BrAPI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brapi.org">http://www.brapi.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/plantbreeding/API">https://github.com/plantbreeding/API</ext-link>), and to work with other groups who may want to consume data from the site being built.</p><p>
<bold>Make your database discoverable by indexing and providing a search engine.</bold> This will expose your data through a standard interface and allows creation of a federated database system.

APIs and other mechanisms for providing machine-readable (i.e. programmatically accessible) data allow researchers to discover data, facilitate the movement of data among different databases and analysis platforms and when coupled with good practices in curation, ontologies and metadata are fundamental to building a web of interconnected data covering the full scope of agricultural research. Without programmatic access to data, the goals laid out in the introduction to this paper cannot be reached because it is simply not possible to store all data in one place, nor is it feasible to work across a distributed environment without computerized support. After a brief description of the current state of data access technology across GGB databases and other online resources, we more fully describe the need for programmatic data access (also referred to as &#x02018;machine access&#x02019;) under Challenges and Opportunities and end with recommendations for best practices.</p><p>Sharing among AgBioData databases is already widespread, either through programmatic access or other means. The results of the AgBioData survey of its members indicate that GGB databases and resources vary in how they acquire and serve their data, particularly to other databases. All but 3 out of 32 GGB databases share data with other databases, and all but two have imported data from other database. Some make use of platforms, such as InterMine (<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), Ensembl (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>) and Tripal (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), to provide programmatic access to data that is standard within, but not across the different options. Other databases develop their own programmatic access or use methods such as file transfer protocol (FTP: a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files on a computer network). Finally, some databases provide no programmatic access to data. A number of infrastructure projects already exist that support AgBioData data access needs, most of which have been adopted to some degree by different GGB platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material 5</xref>).</p><p>A more recent approach to facilitate data search, access and exchange is to define a common API that is supported by multiple database platforms. An example of this is BrAPI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brapi.org">https://brapi.org</ext-link>), which defines querying methods and data exchange formats without requiring any specific database implementation. Each database is free to choose an existing implementation (if compatible) or to develop its own. However, BrAPI&#x02019;s utility is restricted to specific types of data. Alternatively, the Agave API (<xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>) provides a set of services that can be used to access, analyse and manage any type of data from registered systems, but is not customized to work with GGB databases.</p></sec><sec id="sec24"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>Aside from primary repositories like GenBank, model organism and specialty databases remain the primary means of serving data to researchers, particularly for curated or otherwise processed data. These databases represent different community interests, funding sources and data types. They have grown in an <italic>ad hoc</italic> fashion and distribute data in multiple formats, which are often unique to each database and are may be without programmatic access. Below, we lay out some of the challenges and opportunities in programmatic data access faced by GGB researchers using the current landscape of databases. Exploration of these use cases yielded a set of common data access requirements under five different themes, summarized in <xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="TB7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Requirements for programmatic access to data in the genetics, genomics and breeding community</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Theme</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discovery</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<bold>Comparative genomics across species requires access to distributed data.</bold> Large comparative genomic portals exist (e.g. Phytozome, Ensembl, PLAZA) but have limitations in their utility for specialized communities, such as not incorporating data from minor crop species or crop wild relatives or rarely handling multiple genomes for the same species. Distributed and independent genome projects produce assemblies and annotations that can be beneficial to research on related species, if researchers can discover them. However, even a multi-species database that manages gene families may not contain all gene data of interest to the communities it serves. Services that assign new data, supplied by researchers or by other sites, to gene family memberships can help with discovery across databases by putting new sequence data into an evolutionary context, but then the data must be discoverable broadly.</p><p>
<bold>Different genome assembly versions exist.</bold> In GWAS studies, a scientist may be looking for candidate genes near SNPs with significant association to a trait of interest, but find that annotation data in a multi-species database comes from a different assembly version than was used in the study. Possible solutions include (i) the database provides access to annotations on the assembly version used in the study, (ii) the scientist uses a batch coordinate conversion (e.g. LiftOver; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver">https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver</ext-link>) to convert coordinates to the new assembly or (iii) the scientist repeats variant calling and association analysis using the new assembly. The first approach requires the database to offer programmatic access in the form of web services to many versions of assemblies and annotations. The second and third approaches require access to significant compute power, thus requiring databases to invest in computational resources (for solution 2) or to provide access to cloud compute resources with some level of authentication and scalable data transfer (for solution 3).</p><p>
<bold>Integrating data and computational analysis.</bold> Applications that can operate where the data exists, to support comparative access for pre-publication and privately maintained genomes, can reduce the need to move large data sets among locations. For example, a group might generate a draft assembly of an accession with a novel phenotype that they have mapped to a certain genomic region. They may then wish to compare the scaffolds that contain the region of interest to a reference assembly for a different accession or for a related species, to find candidate genes that may be novel to their accession. Existing services such as CyVerse (<xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>) can be used to analyse data from many sources. Being able to do the comparison where the different genomes are located would save moving and duplicating large genome files, but requires considerable investment in distributed computation.</p><p>Another solution is for GGB databases to host a local Galaxy (<xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>) instance connected to a Tripal database (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) with public and private data sets. This is effective if a researcher with phenotypic, genotypic and environmental data (e.g. for GWAS analysis) needs a place to house the data both before and after publication, but is not an expert in genomic analyses or data management. Analysis pipelines tailored to the needs of a particular community, hosted through that community&#x02019;s database, allow researchers to upload, search and visualize private data and public data, select these data and parameterize an association mapping workflow and execute that workflow locally. In order to execute the analysis remotely, data will need to move efficiently from the database to a remote analysis platform.</p><p>
<bold>Data Discovery across platforms.</bold> Scientists often want to discover all that they can about a particular entity (gene, gene model, phenotype, species), but the data are distributed across multiple resources, many of which may be unfamiliar. Each data element on its own is not large, but the total space to be searched is. A hypothetical workflow is as follows: a researcher who works on one species comes to a participating database with a sequence of interest, wanting to find out what biological functions their sequence might be involved in. The researcher identifies homologous sequences in the new database by running BLAST. The database converts the BLAST results to an exchangeable token and queries other databases for information about orthologs. The product of these requests could be as simple as a gene name/symbol and a URL to point the user to the data display at the external database, or could also include provenance and database information for attribution, sequence, publications and many other types of information. For data discovery to work, databases with relevant data and compatible APIs must be discoverable and well documented, and a method should be in place to track usage across different services.</p></sec><sec id="sec25"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Below we present a specific list of recommendations for programmatic data. Numbers in parentheses after each recommendation correspond to the needs outlined in <xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Although the examples discussed above focus on large and/or complex data sets accessed via APIs, some improvements can also apply to databases that are accessed primarily through a web interface.</p><p>
<bold>Move to a federated model of data exchange.</bold> Many of the current challenges with data discovery and exchange could be addressed with a &#x02018;federated&#x02019; model whereby a group of databases has voluntarily agreed to open their data for programmatic access to each other through an API. While the federation does not have the power to compel participation, it does give data providers another source of traffic to their sites and data. At a time when database usage metrics are used by agencies for consideration of continued funding, this is an attractive inducement. Federation also addresses the API standardization problem. Also, the federation can then serve as a common point of advertisement for each participant&#x02019;s services, which in turn could encourage other providers to participate in the federation. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 18)</p><p>
<bold>Use standard transfer protocols, but use modern, efficient ones.</bold> If transfers must occur via the web, databases should use https instead of http. Many databases serve their data primarily as complete files via FTP, which means these files are accessible, but not findable or interoperable. While FTP sites can be accessed programmatically, we recommend that databases move toward federated data exchange. Furthermore, FTP is not the most efficient transfer method and may not work well for larger data sets (e.g. annotated genomes). In contrast, http(s) and other methods such as The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://irods.org">https://irods.org</ext-link>/) allow for a variety of optimizations such as byte-range requests to facilitate indexed access. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 1, 3 and 10)</p><p>
<bold>Provide a direct connection to data.</bold> It is often not feasible for researchers to download data to their own workstations or institution servers for analysis. High-throughput data (genomics and phenomics), because of their size, need a direct connection to analytical resources. CyVerse (<xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>) and Tripal/Galaxy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.drupal.org/project/tripal_galaxy">https://www.drupal.org/project/tripal_galaxy</ext-link>) are two web-based solutions for transfer and analysis of large data sets. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 16, 17 and 18)</p><p>
<bold>Minimize authentication hurdles to data access.</bold> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to log in to a database and insuring that the user is authorized to do so. While authentication is useful to databases because it allows usage tracking, it severely limits programmatic access to data. Therefore, for public data we recommend Genetic and Genomic Database (GDBs) do not require authentication. If a database does require authentication to access data, GGB databases should move toward a single authentication service (or a small suite of authentication services), and the community should pick one or a few (e.g. OAuth or systems that use OAuth such as CyVerse, Github, ORCiD, Google). API specs must accept authentication details and be well documented. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 3, 8 and 9)</p><p>
<bold>Store data in a manner that is consistent with community standards and adopt appropriate ontologies to allow cross-query and integration across platforms.</bold> A specific focus on applying and maintaining appropriate metadata is critical. As experimental methods change, the information associated with raw data also changes. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 4, 5, 6, 7, 13 and 15)</p><p>
<bold>Select one or more database schemas and APIs that are well supported by the development community.</bold> Community-supported generic relational schemas (e.g. Chado) should be used where possible to reduce duplication of effort. Such schemas capture the majority of use cases related to common genetic and genomic data types. They also shorten the time necessary to optimize data storage and exchange. Current efforts in the community are focused on APIs that support the best data storage mechanism for the data (optimized relational schemas, NoSQL solutions and/or data warehousing) to facilitate access. In these cases, web services are developed to expose and share this data. (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 4, 5, 6 and 7)</p><p>
<bold>Provide explicit licensing information that specify download and reuse policies.</bold> No license is legally the same as applying the most restrictive license possible. Therefore, individuals and databases that want to make data available for reuse should formally apply the least restrictive license that makes sense for their data. The most frequently used licenses for data come from the Open Data Commons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendatacommons.org/">https://opendatacommons.org/</ext-link>) and the Creative Common (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/</ext-link>). GGB databases should have practices and policies that encompass the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Exporting license and conditions (metadata) with the data,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Requiring data submitters to agree to licensing and reuse policies,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recommending open access licenses or placing data in the public domain,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ensuring that curators identify licenses for data sets that they gather,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Helping data submitters communicate with their institution about whether they can offer specific licenses given intellectual property rules (<xref rid="TB7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; requirements 6, 13 and 14).</p></list-item></list></p><p>
<bold>Work with your IT department to access high speed Internet.</bold> This often involves moving your database outside a firewall. If appropriate, collaborate with other databases to create transfer links on Advanced Layer 2 Service (AL2S) to speed transfer. AL2S, as part of Internet 2, provides research and education organizations with access to effective and efficient wide area 100 gigabit Ethernet technology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/advanced-networking/layer-2-services/#service-overview">https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/advanced-networking/layer-2-services/#service-overview</ext-link>). (Not specific to any individual requirement, but necessary for success of most of them.)</p><p>
<bold>Capture usage metrics, including requests through APIs.</bold> Some methods for tracking site usage (e.g. Google analytics) are driven primarily by mechanisms involving webpage loads and require additional tooling to be able to handle tracking of web services calls, so development of both useful metrics and methods of capturing them are needed.</p><p>
<bold>Ensure that continuous updates and efforts toward integrating with existing web services and ontologies are followed.</bold> This requires continuous development and interaction with the community of developers working on these APIs. (Not specific to any individual requirement, but necessary for success of most of them.)</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec26"><title>Communication</title><sec id="sec27"><title>Overview</title><p>Improved communication between people working at GGB database is critical to successfully implementing the recommendations made in this paper. In addition, improved communication with people in the research community, funding agencies and journals is critical to the maintenance and reuse of research data.</p><p>There are <bold>four main types of communication</bold> that personnel at GGB databases should consider: (i) communication across GGB databases, (ii) communication with experimental data generators and researchers, (iii) communication with funding agencies and (iv) communication with journals. Here, we consider challenges and recommendations for each communication type in turn.</p></sec><sec id="sec28"><title>Challenges and opportunities</title><p>
<bold>Communication with other GGB databases.</bold> Similarity in the challenges that each GGB database faces (described in the previous sections of this document) means that we have to view each other as collaborators rather than competitors. However, until now there have been few mechanisms and incentives to foster such collaboration.</p><p>
<bold>Communication with researchers.</bold> Communication with researchers must occur in both directions. GGB databases need to effectively communicate their scope and requirements to users. For example, many researchers, however well intentioned, simply do not know best practices for data management and/or how to find long-term storage for their data. GGB databases need to be more proactive in communicating with researchers to learn the researchers&#x02019; needs and to prepare for emerging research. GGB databases can also participate in communication between researchers and data librarians to help researcher craft realistic Data Management Plans. It may not be clear to the researcher how to reach out to the GGB database staff to provide feedback or that such feedback is welcome. Many GGB databases often do not have the funds to accomplish all of this on their own.</p><p>
<bold>Communication with federal funding agencies.</bold> Federal funding agencies supporting GGB databases include USDA-ARS, USDA, NSF and NIH. While it is clear that these agencies value the role of GGB databases, there are several areas where increased communication with funding agencies would better enable our mission of facilitating scientific discovery and application in agriculture. Challenges occur on two levels: (i) how should proper data submission at GGB databases be encouraged and measured; and (ii) how can GGB databases communicate their challenges and the importance of their work to the funding agencies, in order to be considered for competitive grants.</p><p>
<bold>Communication with publishers.</bold> Publishers clearly have an important role to play in making data publicly available and some journals have formed a joint data archiving policy (<xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Most publishers have DNA (genome or gene) data submission policies. In contrast, some forms of research data such as maps, QTL and markers cannot be submitted to primary repositories (such as the INSDC or NCBI), and few peer-reviewed journals require submission of this data to community databases ahead of publication. Even though journals have data submission policies, the majority only &#x02018;strongly encourage&#x02019; data submission. Furthermore, some managing editors do not enforce the journals data policies. Additionally, many reviewers do not verify that the data has been submitted to the database if indicated in the manuscript. Furthermore, metadata required in primary repositories is often insufficient for appropriate reuse within custom databases.</p></sec><sec id="sec29"><title>Recommendations</title><sec id="sec30"><title>Recommendations for communication among GGB databases</title><p>Frequent communication among GGB databases is the primary way to ensure successful collaboration (<xref rid="ref98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). We recommend the following guidelines to improve communication among GGB databases:</p><p>
<bold>Join AgBioData.</bold> Individuals working at GGB Databases can join here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.agbiodata.org">https://www.agbiodata.org</ext-link>. Members of the email list will receive monthly newsletters about upcoming AgBioData conference calls, meetings or events and interesting publications. Also, each member GGB database is listed on the website.</p><p>
<bold>Attend the monthly AgBioData calls.</bold> Each member GGB should have at least one representative on the calls. Each database can actively participate in the selection of topics and speakers. In addition to providing talks relevant to GGB databases, the calls also provide a good forum for discussion. Presentations are recorded and posted at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://AgBioData.org">AgBioData.org</ext-link> and YouTube, however, members are encouraged attend the conference calls to participate in discussions.</p><p>
<bold>Share information and collaborate.</bold> This includes, but is not limited to the following: best practices; data standards and standard operation protocols; data (to reduce redundancy); code and code development; and strategic plans.</p><p>
<bold>Create an AgBioData Advisory Board</bold> to represent the databases at a higher level. Include federal, competitive programs, industry and researchers and have the AgBioData Steering Committee formally report through yearly reports on activities and progress toward improved communication, collaboration and funding acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="sec31"><title>Recommendations for communication with researchers</title><p>
<bold>Mechanisms for outreach.</bold> There are several mechanisms for outreach to researchers. The most common form of outreach is meeting and conference attendance. With a large number of researchers at meeting and conferences GGB databases can use these opportunities for workshops, presentations or a database booth. GGB database brochures can be handed out during the meeting and conferences. However, there are a number of researchers that are unable to attend meeting and conferences so it is important that GGB database also use other forms of outreach. These include newsletters, mailing lists, blog posts and social media (i.e. Facebook and Twitter) to inform researchers about new tools or data, webinars, workshops and videos. These forms of outreach can be used together to reach a broader audience. Using social media during conferences and meetings with the appropriate hashtag can send information about new tools and data to researchers who cannot attend the conference. A prime example of this is the Plant and Animal Genome Conference, which has a strong social media presence.</p><p>
<bold>Make it obvious who is doing the work.</bold> Many online resources and databases do not mention the people on their teams and only provide an anonymous contact form. Individuals working on a resources or database should be named on the website. Being anonymous creates a barrier to communication, and if contact/feedback forms don't generate a response, there is no further recourse for the researcher to get help. Providing individual staff contact information and even photographs makes it easier for researchers to target questions to the appropriate person. Photos can enable researchers to find curators at meetings, and in general encourage communication by putting, literally, a human face on the GGB resources. Building in dedicated time at workshops for a &#x02018;meet the team&#x02019; event, well advertized in advance to the research community, is also recommended to increase engagement opportunities.</p><p>
<bold>Respond quickly to feedback</bold>. Every GGB database should have a feedback form. The feedback should be replied to within a reasonable period of time, say 24 hours during business days, even if you simply acknowledge the receipt of the feedback and provide a date by which the issue can be resolved. Everyone wants to be heard too!</p><p>
<bold>Provide tutorials</bold>. Many GGB databases provide tutorials and FAQs. We propose having a central Tutorial Section at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://AgBioData.org">AgBioData.org</ext-link>, where tutorials relevant to all GGB Databases are available. This could include tutorials on file formats, or the best repositories for specific data types.</p><p>
<bold>Communicate on data management.</bold> GGB databases should work with librarians to develop data management training courses. In addition, online data management modules can be developed to be used in graduate education, perhaps offering some type of certification for successful completion, including long-term assessment of training effectiveness.</p><p>
<bold>Set up an advisory panel.</bold> Implementing advisory panels comprised of active, elected representatives of the stakeholder community, with clear mechanisms for reporting activities and plans of work can allow for direct, constructive feedback from database stakeholders.</p></sec><sec id="sec32"><title>Recommendations for communication with funding agencies</title><p>
<bold>Form an interagency GGB Database Advisory Board.</bold> The board will meet regularly to discuss and document challenges and opportunities for GGB databases, data submission, data availability, data curation, data sharing and sustainability.</p><p>
<bold>Collaborate on data management guidelines.</bold> GGB databases and funding agencies should discuss ways to develop more comprehensive and rigorous data management plans and methods to verify proper data submission to representative databases.</p><p>
<bold>Engage in joint social media activities</bold> to deliver effective impact statements to stakeholders, industry and lawmakers.</p><p>
<bold>Identify or create funding opportunities to support GGB database activities</bold>. Develop a clear understanding of the needs that both data providers and GGB databases face for effective data management and reuse, and highlight or implement funding mechanisms to support these needs.</p></sec><sec id="sec33"><title>Recommendations for communication with publishers</title><p>
<bold>Enforcement and adherence of data policies.</bold> Data policies are only as good as the enforcement and adherence of those policies. The GGB database community and others in the research community need to remind publishers, managing editors and authors of the importance of public data. For publishers that do not have clear data availability policies, AgBioData and cohorts can strongly encourage the publishers to establish clear data availability policies. For the journals that do have data availability policies, the managing editors and reviewers must help enforce the data availability policies. If an author fails to follow the journals data availability policies the reviewer is within his/her right to reject the manuscript. Data curators who encounter a paper lacking publicly accessible data without obvious reason (e.g. proprietary funding) should notify the journal editors. In addition, as a collective, AgBioData will negotiate with the publishers to change public data submission from &#x02018;strongly encouraged&#x02019; to &#x02018;required&#x02019;.</p><p>
<bold>Inter-agency sponsored workshop for journal publishers and editors.</bold> Overcoming the challenge of reliable data submission will require communication among representatives from the appropriate journals, GGB databases and funding agencies to establish guidelines and an easy-to-submit and police system for researchers and the journals/funding agencies and databases. This would likely be best initiated through an inter-agency sponsored workshop, followed up by regular meetings and assessment of effectiveness. Such a workshop could also develop ways to ensure journal publishers and editors are aware of all relevant GGB databases so they can direct authors of each accepted paper to the proper repository, nomenclature clearing house etc. Providing access to centralized cyberinfrastructure where databases, journals and funding agencies could sign off on successful data submission for projects would help make this process easier for all parties and ensure accountability.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec34"><title>Sustainability</title><sec id="sec35"><title>Overview</title><p>The GGB databases that currently comprise the AgBioData Consortium were created to serve the needs of researchers for access to curated and integrated data and analysis/visualization tools to aid scientific discovery, translation and application. The funding for these databases, however, is limited and not stable. Maintaining these resources in the longer term so that invaluable data are kept up-to-date and do not get lost is a major issue facing almost all AgBioData databases, their researcher communities and funding agencies.</p></sec><sec id="sec36"><title>Challenges</title><p>AgBioData databases are supported through a variety of sources. Generally these fall into one of four categories: (i) primarily supported through line-item government funding, such as the USDA-ARS databases MaizeGDB, SoyBase, GrainGenes, Legume Information System and GRIN; (ii) primarily supported through competitive federal grants, such as TreeGenes, Hardwood Genomics, Gramene, Planteome, Solanaceae Genomics Network and Araport; (iii) supported through a combination of competitive federal grants, commissions and industry, such as the Genome Database for Rosaceae, AgBase, PeanutBase, AnimalQTLdb and CottonGen; and (iv) supported primarily through a user subscription model, such as TAIR.</p><p>With long-term government funding, the USDA-ARS databases enjoy the most stable financial support of the AgBioData databases. They typically represent high-value commodity crops serving a large research and industry community. While the level of support provided by USDA-ARS generally allows for continuation of base activities and curation, it typically does not provide resources for technical innovation or more resource-efficient systems to be implemented. For these, funding through competitive grants is increasingly necessary, as in the case of the NSF-funded Legume Federation award. At the other extreme lies TAIR, which after a phased withdrawal of support by NSF, successfully implemented a subscription-type funding model under a not-for-profit organizational structure (<xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). As the model plant for functional genomics, TAIR also has a large user community making this funding option more feasible to implement than for the databases represented in categories 2 and 3.</p><p>Many of the AgBioData databases have reported willingness of the scientific stakeholders to budget some funds in their grants to support data deposit and access to their community databases, similar in how they budget for peer-reviewed, open access publications costs. Unfortunately, most of the databases do not have organizational structures or processes that would allow them to accept these funds.</p></sec><sec id="sec37"><title>Recommendations</title><p>While the purpose of this white paper is not to specifically recommend solutions to increase or stabilize funding of AgBioData databases, it should serve to start a meaningful and informed dialog with funding sources and research communities on sustainability of these resources.</p><p>
<bold>All the AgBioData databases should develop sustainability plans</bold> through detailed strategic planning that actively includes stakeholders and funding agencies. These plans should detail and communicate the value proposition of their resource, construct budgets that plan for both subsistence-type operational costs and growth-type activities and even include exit plan strategies for the databases, should funding cease. The release of the &#x02018;Process Guide for Data Repository Sustainability&#x02019; document by the Ecological Society of America following the NSF-sponsored Data Repository Sustainability Workshop held January 2018 should serve as a useful resource to develop these sustainability plans.</p><p>
<bold>Federal funding should be provided to support an overall review of AgBioData databases sustainability options</bold>. This could be done by an organization that has already successfully gone through this process, such as Phoenix Bioinformatics for TAIR. One option might be to form a new not-for-profit organization, possibly through a partnership with Phoenix Bioinformatics, to create a process where researchers who budget support for data deposit and/or data access in their successful proposals can easily transfer these funds to their community databases through the not-for-profit. This would remove some of the current obstacles to accepting support from scientists that the databases face and provide a steady flow of funds once it become standard practice by scientists to include these in grants.</p><p>
<bold>Funding agencies should require a sustainability plan in proposals for new biological online resources.</bold> Whatever series of options/solutions are developed to address sustainability of funds, it is clear that implementing these as a consortium is much more powerful and impactful. Funding more AgBioData workshops to further this dialogue will be critical to deriving solutions to the GGB database sustainability challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec38"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To enable all GGB databases to help their stakeholders utilize the increasingly complex biological data within and across the databases, we need to work together to adopt a common set of metadata, ontologies and communication practices; make it easy to share data; share curation practices; use common software platforms and components where reasonable; and provide solutions for long-term funding. The AgBioData consortium believes that the recommendations laid out in this white paper and continued communication between the people that power the many different GGB databases will allow us all to move forward in the right direction. Regular communication and transparency is the key for all these endeavors. While recognizing that it may be difficult for databases to comply with all of the recommendations outlined in this paper, a slow and steady push toward meeting the recommendations should be encouraged. This will not only make the work of biocurators more productive, it will improve the experience for researchers.</p><p>For all agriculturally relevant GGB database personnel, we recommend joining the AgBioData consortium, attending the monthly conference call seminars, joining a working group and working with your counterparts in other databases listed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://agbiodata.org">agbiodata.org</ext-link>. A little time invested now in working together and applying common standards can save a lot of time later and prevent duplicated efforts in the development of tools and resources.</p><p>While the next step for AgBioData members is to work toward compliance with the recommendations outlined in this paper, we also realize that working closely with researchers, journals and funders is critical. Just as no one author of this paper was aware of all the resources mentioned herein, the situation can be even more confusing for scientists who primarily work at the bench or in the field, especially those not working in genomics. Training of both data and bench scientists and streamlining data management practices will get us closer to the goal of easy access to all data. We are all on the same page; the struggle is how to write that page!</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="bay088_supp.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge with thanks The National Science Foundation Plant Genome Research Program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1444573">Award # 1444573</ext-link> for funding the AgBioData Workshop and development and hosting of the AgBioData website.
