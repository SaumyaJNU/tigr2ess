Sixty rats were divided into the sham operation (n=20), the model (n=20) and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group (n=20) using the random table method. The treatment group received administration of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills. The model and the sham operation group were given the same amount of normal saline. Within 24 h after the last administration, the rats were sacrificed. The myocardia were used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and histological examination. In the sham operation group, cardiomyocytes were stained evenly and arranged neatly and densely with clear structures. In the model group, the cell morphology was fuzzy, the myocytes were hypertrophied, the nuclear pyknosis was fragmented, the arrangement was disordered, the intercellular space was narrowed, and the cytoplasm was missing. The apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes in the model and Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were significantly higher than that in the sham operation group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The myocardial infarction areas in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were larger than that in the sham operation group (P&#x0003c;0.05). The expression levels of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (Smad2), Smad3, and caspase-3 messenger ribonucleic acids and proteins in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were higher than those in the sham operation group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Qishen Yiqi dropping pills have an obvious myocardial protective effect on CHF rats, which may enhance the degree of myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smads pathway and improve cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the caspase-3 signaling pathway, thus protecting the myocardium.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic heart failure</kwd><kwd>Qishen Yiqi dropping pills</kwd><kwd>myocardial fibrosis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the manifestations and the main causes of death of various cardiovascular diseases in the terminal stage (<xref rid="b1-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Prevention and treatment for CHF in coronary heart disease are one of the impotant research issues world-wide. The pathogenesis of CHF is very complicated, and it is considered that the cardiac overload, mainly characterized by pathological remodeling of the left ventricle, involving various factors and primarily manifested as neuroendocrinology, is the main cause of CHF (<xref rid="b2-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Traditional Chinese medicine has certain advantages in the treatment of CHF, such as minor side effects, improvement of symptoms, whole recuperative medical care and improvement of the patient's quality of life. The main components of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills are Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), Huangqi (radix astragali), Sanqi (radix notoginseng) and Jiangxiang oil (Lignum Dalbergiae Odoriferae Oil), and the pills have effects of activating blood circulation, relieving pain, and promoting circulation of <italic>qi</italic>. Qishen Yiqi dropping pills have been proved to have certain curative effects in the treatment of CHF with few adverse reactions (<xref rid="b3-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, there is still no report on the exact mechanism of CHF treatment with Qishen Yiqi dropping pills. This study aims to analyze the protective effect of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills on the myocardium of rats by establishing the rat model of CHF with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Experimental animals and grouping</title><p>A total of 60 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) SD male rats weighing 250&#x02013;360 g, with an average weight of 280&#x000b1;15 g were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Center Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The rats were fed to acclimate for 1 week. They were kept in cages in the dark at 25&#x000b0;C with enough millet and cold boiled water.

Hydrated chloral mixture was intraperitoneally injected to anaesthetize the potruncus of rats for skin preparation, rats were connected to small animal ventilator. &#x003a4;he skin at the pulsating cardiac apex was cut to expose the heart, and the anterior descending coronary artery was cut with a 0-gauge suture. The myocardial ischemic changes for 30 min displayed in an electrocardiogram indicated a successful surgery. After the model was successfully established, the heart was quickly laid back, and the chest wall was sutured. Intramuscular injection of penicillin was conducted to prevent infection for 7 consecutive days. In the sham operation group, the left anterior descending coronary artery was only occluded with sutures but not ligated after thoracotomy. The other procedures were the same as above.</p></sec><sec><title>Administration methods</title><p>On the 7th day after modeling, the treatment group was intragastrically administered with Qishen Yiqi dropping pills (0.135 g/kg) once a day for 4 consecutive weeks.

CHF not only has a high prevalence rate but also has a poor prognosis, and it has become one of the leading causes of death among the elderly (<xref rid="b4-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Most scholars agree that the pathological remodeling of the left ventricle is the most important pathophysiological mechanism of the occurrence of CHF. Decreased cardiac function and left ventricular hypertrophy are the main signs of left ventricular remodeling. In current clinical treatment for CHF, &#x003b2;-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used to inhibit neuroendocrine activation during heart failure generally based on the symptomatic treatments such as vasodilation, cardiac arrest and diuresis so as to delay and prevent myocardial remodeling, thereby reducing the patient's hospitalization and mortality rates (<xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, in general, the overall efficacy of western medicine in the treatment of CHF is unsatisfactory.</p><p>The treatment of CHF with traditional Chinese medicine has a long history, which can alleviate the symptoms of patients, improve their quality of life, and delay the occurrence and development of CHF. In the theory of Traditional Chinese medicine, CHF has been included in the category of syndromes such as &#x02018;edema&#x02019;, &#x02018;thoracic obstruction&#x02019;, &#x02018;dyspnea with cough&#x02019; and &#x02018;palpitation&#x02019;. It is believed that due to multiple etiologies, the body's <italic>qi</italic>, blood, yin and yang are impaired. Zang-Fu imbalance leads to internal retention of water with extravasated blood. The pathogenesis of the disease is blood stasis, the heart-yang, water-rheum collecting internally and heart-<italic>qi</italic> deficiency, and its treatment is based on the principles of promoting blood circulation and collaterals and replenishing yang. Qishen Yiqi dropping pills are a traditional Chinese medicine preparation composed of Danshen, Huangqi, Jiangxiang and Sanqi, which have the functions of activating blood circulation, relieving pain and promoting circulation of <italic>qi</italic>. With a stable dosage form and reliable clinical efficacy, it is one of the representative drugs in the treatment of heart disease with traditional Chinese medicine (<xref rid="b8-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that Qishen Yiqi dropping pills play roles in expanding coronary blood vessels, increasing coronary sinus blood oxygen content and coronary blood flow volume, improving myocardial blood and oxygen supply, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption index, elevating cardiac stroke output and cardiac output, increasing the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure, and adjusting cardiac compliance (<xref rid="b11-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). At the same time, Qishen Yiqi dropping pills can lower the platelet aggregation rate, reduce the thickness of aortic plaques, tend to reduce the area of aortic plaques, and have the effects of preventing and treating atherosclerosis and anti-lipid peroxidation (<xref rid="b13-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The myocardial protective effect of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills on CHF rats was investigated in this study. The results indicated that after treatment with Qishen Yiqi dropping pills, the morphology of myocardial cells tended to be normal, and the rate of apoptosis and myocardial infarction area were decreased, suggesting that Qishen Yiqi dropping pills can protect the myocardium, and its possible mechanism is to reduce the degree of myocardial cell apoptosis and inhibit the fibrosis of myocardial cells.</p><p>Increased expression level of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the vascular wall can promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, lipid accumulation in the arterial wall and inflammatory cell infiltration, and these factors are all crucial steps in myocardial cell fibrosis (<xref rid="b14-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As the main downstream mediators of TGF-&#x003b2;1, Smad2 and Smad3 play important roles in the process of myocardial fibrosis (<xref rid="b15-etm-0-0-6957" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). After phosphorylation, Smad2/3 can bind to Smad4 to form a complex involved in the regulation of gene transcription, so as to promote the expression of collagens as well as the formation and progression of myocardial fibrosis. Caspase-3 is one of the important genes for apoptosis. The results of RT-PCR and western blot analysis in this study manifested that Qishen Yiqi dropping pills might improve the degree of myocardial fibrosis by suppressing the TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smads pathway and inhibit apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by impeding the caspase-3 signaling pathway, thus protecting the myocardium.</p><p>In summary, Qishen Yiqi dropping pills obviously protect the myocardium of CHF rats, which may improve the degree of myocardial fibrosis by impeding the TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smads pathway and improve cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the caspase-3 signaling pathway, so as to play a role in protecting the myocardium. However, since traditional Chinese medicine is characterized by multiple components, multiple targets and comprehensive treatments, the conclusions of this study have to be further verified.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the present study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YL and DW wrote the manuscript.
