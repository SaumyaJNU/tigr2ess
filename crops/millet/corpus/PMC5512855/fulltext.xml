important role in determining the structure and physical properties of starch granules. Multiple SBEs are involved in starch
biosynthesis in plants. Finger millet is calcium rich important serial crop belongs to grass family and the transcriptome data of
developing spikes is available on NCBI. In this study it was try to find out the gene sequence of starch branching enzyme and annotate
the sequence and submit the sequence for further use. Rice SBE sequence was taken as reference and for characterization of the
sequence different in silico tools were used. Four domains were found in the finger millet Starch branching enzyme like alpha amylase
catalytic domain from 925 to2172 with E value 0, N-terminal Early set domain from 634 to 915 with E value 1.62 e-42, Alpha amylase,
C-terminal all-beta domain from 2224 to 2511 with E value 5.80e-24 and 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme from 421 to 2517 with E
value 0. Major binding interactions with the GLC (alpha-d-glucose), CA (calcium ion), GOL (glycerol), TRS (2-amino-2-hydroxymethylpropane-
1, 3-diol), MG (magnesium ion) and FLC (citrate anion) are fond with different residues. It was found in the phylogenetic
study of the finger millet SBE with the 6 species of grass family that two clusters were form A and B. In cluster A, finger millet showed
closeness with Oryzasativa and Setariaitalica, Sorghum bicolour and Zea mays while cluster B was formed with Triticumaestivum and
Brachypodium distachyon. The nucleotide sequence of Finger millet SBE was submitted to NCBI with the accession no KY648913 and
protein structure of SBE of finger millet was also submitted in PMDB with the PMDB id - PM0080938. This research presents a
comparative overview of Finger millet SBE and includes their properties, structural and functional characteristics, and recent
developments on their post-translational regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Finger millet</kwd><kwd>CDS</kwd><kwd>SBE</kwd><kwd>Domain</kwd><kwd>PMDB</kwd><kwd>NCBI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>A cereal is a grass, a member of the monocot family poaceae also
known as gramineae, which usually have long, thin stalks, such
as wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley and rye, whose
starchy grains are used as food. The term cereal is not limited to
these grains, but, also refers to foodstuff prepared from the
starchy grains of cereal like flours, breads and pasta [<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All
cereals are annual plants and consequently, one planting yields
one harvest. The demands on climate, however, are different.
Warm-season cereals (corn, rice, sorghum, millet) are grown in
tropical lowlands throughout the year and in temperate climates
during the frost- free season. Rice is mainly grown in flooded
fields, and sorghum and millet are adapted to arid conditions.
Cool-season cereals (wheat, rye, barley, and oats) grow best in a
moderate climate. Finger millet is considered to be a boon for
diabetes patients and obese people, as the digestion of finger
Millet takes place at a slow pace and hence, glucose is released
slowly into the blood [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Starch-branching enzymes (SBEs) are
one of the four major enzyme classes involved in starch
biosynthesis in plants [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Starch is the important molecule for
plant development and reproduction. Re-structuring of starch
granules in-planta can affect plant metabolism and by the
research it was proved that the starch branching enzymes play an
important role in the Re-structuring of starch granules [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
Starch can define as a complex branched glucose polymer and the
branch molecular weight distribution powerup the nutritionally 
important properties such as digestion rate, etc [<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By different
studies it was also found that different branching enzyme
isoforms contribute separately to the synthesis and final structure
of amylopectin [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One research describe that the
comprehensive in vitro studie revealed different enzymatic
characteristics of the BE isozymes and observed the important
roles of BE isozymes in amylopectin biosynthesis in the
endosperm [<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In rice and other related plants of grass family
like Oryzasativa and Setariaitalica, Sorghum bicolour and Zea mays
while cluster B was formed with Triticumaestivum and
Brachypodiumdistachyon the sequence of starch branching enzyme
is known but in finger millet the nucleotide sequence of the
Starch branching enzyme is not yet known. Availability of the
transcriptome data of developing spikes of finger millet provide
an opportunity to predict the gene sequence of important traits of
nutritional point view. Hence an effort is made for the prediction
of an important enzyme i.e. starch branching enzyme in the
finger millet and submit the genomic as well as proteomic
information for further scientific and research interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence Retrieval</title><p>The sequence of Starch branching enzyme of finger millet was
retrieved by the blast analysis of homologous sequence of rice
obtained from NCBI. Local BLAST [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] was used to retrieve the
sequence of Starch branching enzyme of finger millet from the
transcriptome data of finger millet of developing spikes.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ORF Prediction</title><p>The open reading frame analysis of starch branching enzyme was
completed using ORF prediction tool at NCBI
(https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/orffinder) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The minimal
ORF length in nucleotide was set to 75 and ATG codon was used
as start codon for the ORF translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Domain Analysis</title><p>After prediction of ORF we had gone prediction of domain in the
coding region of starch branching enzyme (homologous to rice).
CD-Search tool of NCBI [<xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was used for the prediction of

CDD V3.15-48963 PSSMs was used at the expect value
0.010000(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.

millet was done by the two ways. In the first way the
phylogenetic study was done on the basis of blast result of NCBI,
total hit sequences were taken for the multiple sequence
alignment and then gone for phylogenetic analysis by the
neighbour joining method using MEGA6 tool [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In other hand
the phylogenetic was done only the species of grass family
including Setariaitalica, Triticumaestivum, Sorghum bicolour,
Brachypodiumdistachyon, Zea mays, Oryzasativa and finger
millet.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Structure Analysis</title><p>The protein sequence of the coding sequence of starch branching

enzymes in plants. E or "early" set domains are associated with
the catalytic domain of the 1,4 alpha glucan branching enzymes
at the N-terminal end. These enzymes catalyze the formation of
alpha-1, 6 branch points in either glycogen or starch by cleavage
of the alpha-1,4 glucosidic linkage, yielding a non-reducing end
oligosaccharide chain, as well as the subsequent attachment of
short glucosyl chains to the alpha-1,6 position. Starch is

different regions of worlds and even in adverse weather
conditions. It has the abundant amount of calcium comparatively
all the cereal crops. The transcriptome data of finger millet is also
available on NCBI but the genome of this important crop is not
yet available. Different pathways are involved in the starch
biosynthesis with the presence of different enzymes. In finger
millet Starch branching enzyme nucleotide and protein sequence
is not yet known but in this research it was an attempt to predict
the genomic and proteomic information of SBE of finger millet,
which plays an important role in the synthesis of carbohydrates.
The predicted nucleotide sequence and protein structure is
available in NCBI and PMDB respectively for further scientific
use. This is a first novel attempt for the characterization of
enzyme involved in starch biosynthesis in finger millet.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Edited by P Kangueane</bold></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Citation: </bold>Tyagi et al.
