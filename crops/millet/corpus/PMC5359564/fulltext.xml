Under laboratory conditions, <italic>T. hamatum</italic> seed treatment significantly enhanced pearl millet seed germination and seedling vigor. <italic>T. hamatum</italic> seed treatment resulted in systemic and durable immunity against pearl millet downy mildew disease under greenhouse and field conditions. <italic>T. hamatum</italic> treated seedlings responded to downy mildew infection with high lignification and callose deposition. Analysis of defense enzymes showed that <italic>T. hamatum</italic> treatment significantly enhanced the activities of glucanase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and polyphenol oxidase in comparison to untreated control.

R. Br.), occupies a unique position among cereal crops because of its ability to grow under poor environments and provide nutritious food, feed, fodder, and livelihood support. It is a staple food for millions of people around the world. It is often cultivated under extremely harsh conditions of frequent drought, high temperature, low and erratic rainfall in infertile soils having poor water holding capacity. It is currently grown in an area of over 28 million hectares worldwide, upon which approximately 500 million people depend on for their survival. In India, it is grown in an area of 7.95 million hectares with an annual production of 8.9 million tons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Since growth in cultivated areas is unlikely to contribute much to future production, the burden of meeting increased demand for pearl millet rests on improvements in crop yields.</p><p>Downy mildew disease caused by the biotrophic oomycete <italic>Sclerospora graminicola</italic> (Sacc.) Schroet, is a major constraint for pearl millet production, causing exhaustive losses up to 80%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Management of pearl millet downy mildew is achieved by cultural practices, use of resistant cultivars, chemical, and biological control, but each with its own shortcomings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. High variation in genetics and virulence among isolates of <italic>S. graminicola</italic> results in regular breakdown of resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Currently recommended chemicals like metalaxyl are hazardous and also not easily accessed by the farmers. Lack of effective mass production and delivery methods have limited the use of biological control methods. Hence, there is always a search for an alternative to the use of chemicals, which can offer effective control and at the same time be economical, safe and eco-friendly.</p><p><italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. are free-living opportunistic, avirulent plant symbiotic or parasitic fungi inhabiting soil and root ecosystems. <italic>Trichoderma</italic> occurs as endophytes often colonizing the roots and penetrate a few cell layers beyond the epidermis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Such colonization of roots by <italic>Trichoderma</italic> often results in better uptake of nutrients, increased root growth and development, enhanced productivity and, improved tolerance to various stresses including diseases. <italic>Trichoderma</italic> produces a wide spectrum of secondary metabolites that are known to serve as triggers of systemic resistance against a broad range of plant pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. There are numerous reports of various <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. induced resistance against different plant pathogens. Root colonization by different <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. like <italic>T. asperellum, T. hamatum, T. harzianum</italic> and <italic>T. virens</italic> have triggered systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against different diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Particularly, <italic>Trichoderma hamatum</italic> has been efficient in triggering SAR in many host-pathosystems. <italic>Trichoderma hamatum</italic> T382 effectively induced resistance against <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and <italic>Xanthomonas vesicatoria</italic> in tomato<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. <italic>Trichoderma hamatum</italic> GD12 elicited resistance against <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> in rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><italic>, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> and <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> in lettuce<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Induction of resistance by several elicitors against a range of pathogens has been shown to be mediated by the plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. SA is also vital for the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and the synthesis of defensive compounds including lignin, callose, and various defense enzymes which are associated with both local and systemic acquired resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. SA biosynthesis significantly enhanced upon tobacco mosaic virus infection in tobacco and the <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulting in increased host resistance against these pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate if endophytic <italic>T. hamatum</italic> strain UoM 13 isolated from pearl millet host plants is efficient to elicit systemic immunity against pearl millet downy mildew disease. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of important defense proteins, like PR1, PR5, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) and defense enzymes such as peroxidase (POX), &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), in the pearl millet&#x02013;<italic>S. graminicola</italic> interaction. Therefore, the role of some of the important defense enzymes and PR proteins involved in <italic>T. hamatum</italic> induced SAR in pearl millet were evaluated. Since enhanced production of antimicrobial enzymes and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are induced by the SA signaling during induction of resistance, the present study also aimed to analyze the role of endogenous SA accumulation and SA biosynthetic genes.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular identification of <italic>T. hamatum</italic> UoM 13</title><p>The ITS1 and ITS4 primer amplified ~560&#x02009;bp fragment from the entire genomic DNA isolated from a pure culture of <italic>T. hamatum</italic> UoM 13 and no non-specific bands were observed.
