Six sessions of sprint interval training improves running performance in trained athletes. <italic>J Strength Cond Res</italic> 32(3): 617&#x02013;623, 2018&#x02014;Sprint interval training (SIT) is gaining popularity with endurance athletes. Various studies have shown that SIT allows for similar or greater endurance, strength, and power performance improvements than traditional endurance training but demands less time and volume. One of the main limitations in SIT research is that most studies were performed in a laboratory using expensive treadmills or ergometers. The aim of this study was to assess the performance effects of a novel short-term and highly accessible training protocol based on maximal shuttle runs in the field (SIT-F). Sixteen (12 male, 4 female) trained trail runners completed a 2-week procedure consisting of 4&#x02013;7 bouts of 30 seconds at maximal intensity interspersed by 4 minutes of recovery, 3 times a week. Maximal aerobic speed (MAS), time to exhaustion at 90% of MAS before test (Tmax at 90% MAS), and 3,000-m time trial (TT3000m) were evaluated before and after training. Data were analyzed using a paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test, and Cohen's (<italic>d</italic>) effect sizes were calculated. Maximal aerobic speed improved by 2.3% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.22), whereas peak power (PP) and mean power (MP) increased by 2.4% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009, <italic>d</italic> = 0.33) and 2.8% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <italic>d</italic> = 0.41), respectively. TT3000m was 6% shorter (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.35), whereas Tmax at 90% MAS was 42% longer (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.74). Sprint interval training in the field significantly improved the 3,000-m run, time to exhaustion, PP, and MP in trained trail runners. Sprint interval training in the field is a time-efficient and cost-free means of improving both endurance and power performance in trained athletes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>endurance</kwd><kwd>field</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>repeated sprints</kwd><kwd>power</kwd><kwd>capacity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sprint interval training (SIT) is based on repeated short-maximal or near-maximal sprints (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). From a theoretical point of view, SIT performed for relatively short periods, a few weeks, to a few months, has been shown to induce enzymatic adaptations in the 3 energetic systems (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). For instance, an increase in the activity of glycolytic enzymes and increased markers of aerobic metabolism have been established after SIT training (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These results can be explained by the significant contribution of the aerobic metabolism during SIT (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Moreover, several meta-analyses have concluded that SIT significantly increases aerobic and anaerobic performance in both trained and untrained athletes (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>From a practical standpoint, Taylor et al. (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) show that SIT can induce small to large improvements in activities where strength, power, and speed are needed, such as countermovement jumps or 10&#x02013;30-m sprints. Taylor et al. (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) also highlighted that in some cases, repeated sprints are even more efficient at improving short-sprint performance than methods such as plyometric training. Recent studies have also shown promising results using repeated sprints on improving cognitive function (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), attenuating rating of perceived exertion and leg pain (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), and even assisting clinical decision making regarding return to sport after injuries (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Although methods using repeated sprints are valuable, the existing literature has a clear lack of studies performed in the field as most SIT research studies (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) have been completed in a laboratory setting. For instance, in studies that used a 2-week intervention period, the use of a Wingate protocol on a cycle ergometer was systematic (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In addition, in the 4&#x02013;10-week protocols, cycle ergometers or treadmills were used indifferently (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which makes sense because SIT on a treadmill has recently shown similar benefits to SIT performed on cycle ergometers (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, cycle ergometers and treadmills can be expensive and time-consuming, especially when several subjects are training at the same time (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, they are not practical for most practitioners. In addition, time and resources are often limited; so, protocols lasting 4&#x02013;10 weeks are not always applicable.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the current study was to test the effects of a novel, short-term SIT method performed in the field (SIT-F), which requires only cones and a chronometer, on performance in trained athletes. The tested hypothesis was that 6 sessions of SIT-F spread over only 2 weeks, with 2 days of recovery between sessions, would significantly improve short-term running performance as measured using a 3,000-m time trial (TT3000m) and time to exhaustion at 90% of maximum aerobic speed (MAS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental Approach to the Problem</title><p>The experimental protocol, adapted from Burgomaster et al.

It may be objected that they used a time to exhaustion at 100% MAS, whereas the current study used time to exhaustion at 90% of MAS. It is crucial to notice that these studies varied in length from 4 to 10 weeks, compared with the 2-week intervention period of the current study.</p><p>After only 2 weeks of SIT-F, the subjects of this study completed the TT3000m 5.7% faster than pretesting. This improvement in the TT3000m was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); however, the practical effect was found to be small to medium (<italic>d</italic> = 0.35). Compared with our results in time to exhaustion, the improvement is much lower; however, the results are similar to Amann et al. (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) who found that the difference in time to exhaustion was much greater than the difference in time-trial performance when comparing normoxia and hypoxia. More specifically, very few SIT studies have examined 3,000-m time trials and were lasting from 6 (Ciciony-Kolsky et al. (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); untrained) to 10 weeks (Esfarjani and Laursen (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>); trained). Nonetheless, the improvements seen in the current study are comparable or greater.</p><p>If we consider that time trials completed at 2,000 and 5,000 m are also relevant to the current study, we once again obtained similar or greater performance increases than studies with untrained subjects cycling or running on treadmills, and lasting 2 (Hazell et al. (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); &#x02212;5.2% on TT5000m), 4 (Willoughby et al. (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); &#x02212;5.9% on TT2000m/Denham et al. (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); &#x02212;4.5% on TT5000m), or 6 weeks (Macpherson et al. (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); &#x02212;4.6% on TT2000m).</p><p>In 10-km time trials, Iaia et al. (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) saw no improvement. Burgomaster et al. (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and Jakeman et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) showed that performance was improved by &#x0223c;10% in 2 weeks. The difference with the current study can be explained by the fact that their subjects were untrained (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and the training and testing protocols were different compared with ours (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Maximal aerobic speed improved significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) by 2.8% in following the 2-week intervention. With the exception of Burgomaster et al. (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) who did not see an effect on &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>max, all literature that used a 2-week intervention period (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) exhibit a range of improvements from 5.5 to 13%, which is higher than this study. The differences in study design can at least partially explain the different percentages of improvement seen in &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>max because they all used a cycle ergometer as their training and testing apparatus and were conducted in untrained subjects.</p><p>The PP (2.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and MP (2.9%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) improved significantly but with only small-to-medium (<italic>d</italic> = 0.33) and medium (<italic>d</italic> = 0.41) practical effects. Significant <italic>p</italic> values, at least in part, are likely due to nearly the entire cohort (14/16 athletes) experiencing maintained or improved performance. Comparatively, obtaining large practical improvements in merely 2 weeks can be substantially more difficult (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nonetheless, improvements seen were lower than the bulk of the literature, which experienced 3&#x02013;17% improvements in PP and MP outputs (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Besides the previously discussed differences in subject training experience, the current study used a series of field tests, which do not allow for the same level of accuracy as a cycle ergometer or direct physiological measures. This limitation may also explain why FI did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.17), despite showing a potentially meaningful effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51).</p><p>Although muscle biopsies could not be obtained, it is speculated that the rapid improvement seen was largely due to an increase in the enzymatic activity of the aerobic system as demonstrated in several studies (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, FI and anaerobic capacity also improved in our study, although the improvements in FI did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.17, <italic>d</italic> = 0.51). Sprint interval training performed for relatively short periods, from weeks to a few months, have been shown to result in important changes at the musculoskeletal level causing enzymatic adaptations in the energetic systems (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Likewise, an increase in the activity of glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase) and increased markers of aerobic metabolism (citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) have also been established (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In addition, Parra et al. (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) found significant improvements in the activity of creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, the type of training performed in this study could have potentially improved neuromuscular capacity in elite endurance runners. These adaptations may result in improved running economy and, therefore, performance (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Further studies using biopsies, electromyography, and direct &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> measurements should be implemented in the future to confirm these speculations.</p><p>Shuttle runs were selected over straight-line sprints in this study for a variety of reasons. First, the physiological tests used in the current study were completed on a 400-m running track and required none of the change of direction skills needed to perform shuttle runs. This difference was designed to avoid an increase in results that were simply due to skill acquisition and to isolate the physiological adaptations. Second, shuttle runs allow for higher levels of interaction and &#x0201c;competition&#x0201d; between multiple athletes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which may lead to greater motivation. Finally, shuttle runs have a practical advantage over sprinting on a track because running for 30 seconds requires a relatively large area, whereas shuttle runs can be performed in much smaller spaces.</p><p>Although the use of a control group is generally valuable, 100% of SIT studies that have included 1 saw no statistical changes, regardless of the population (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Furthermore, finding trained athletes is difficult; therefore, we decided not to reduce the number of subjects in the intervention group by delegating several to a group that would likely show no significant changes. A direct measure of &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>max was not performed in this study. This potential limitation may be an area to examine with future research on SIT in the field.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Practical Applications</title><p>Modern coaches often deal with an increasingly large number of competitions during the competitive season, which subsequently reduces the preparation time available. The results of the current study demonstrate that a very short-term low-volume SIT on a track or field is an effective means of improving both endurance and anaerobic performance. Moreover, there are other benefits of integrating the novel SIT-F method from this study. First, it is nearly costless because no special equipment is needed. Second, this method can be used nearly anywhere because only 30 m of continuous space is required. This can be especially valuable if and when suboptimal weather conditions force practitioners to move indoors. Third, several athletes can be run through the training protocol at once, which help to ensure high levels of motivation and effective use of time. Finally, in individual sports, SIT can also be used as a tapering method by subsequently allowing for high intensities and low volume levels.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hopkins</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name><name><surname>Marcora</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group>
