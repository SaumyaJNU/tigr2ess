    "Atypical presentations of cutaneous tuberculosis (TB) are not uncommon and are frequently overlooked in clinical practice, leading to late diagnosis and increased morbidity. Strong clinical suspicion, histopathology, and response to antituberculous treatment are required for its diagnosis. In today's era, when TB threatens to burst into pandemics again, early diagnosis and treatment are very important for the control of disease. We are reporting a case of cutaneous TB which was initially thought to be a mycetoma."
