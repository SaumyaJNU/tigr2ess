Menarche is a hallmark biological process of puberty[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in adolescence girls and it leads to reproductive capacity. Menstrual abnormalities are common in adolescent and can lead to stressful conditions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] All over the world around 75% of girls are experiencing problems associated with menstruation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The major abnormalities are dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and menstrual irregularities.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These disorders may lead to problems in daily activities such as academic excellence, achievements in sports, and loss of self-confidence.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The lifestyle pattern of any individual leads to their prone of disease.

Influence of globalization changes the lifestyle of local people in positive as well as negative aspect. In Uttarakhand, one-third of the females between 15 and 49 years are undernourished[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] due to poor energy intake and junk food. The dietary pattern in hilly region also shifts from local pahari food to Western foods among the adolescent age group. Hence, it is important to evaluate the influence of eating habits on menstrual disorders in young women. The relationship between food habit and menstrual dysfunction has been becoming an important issue in the world.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Apart from feeding habits, physical activities, daily routine lifestyle, and work stress also influence directly or indirectly the female reproductive cycle.</p><p>Although menstrual disorders are common among females, no study on regarding their prevalence and associate factors were found in hilly populations, especially in Garhwali communities. Hence, this study aims to find out the pattern of menstrual abnormalities in school going girls in Garhwali population and their association with dietary habits and physical work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted in adolescent girls. In this study, 13&#x02013;19-year age girls were selected from different location of Garhwal region. The purpose of the study was clearly explained to each student and after that who were willing to participate, selected for further study. The girls were asked to signed a consent form before participating in the study.</p><p>The questionnaires were explained properly to them, which dealt with different parameters such as socioeconomic data, feeding habits, physical activity, menstrual history, and irregularities. Students, who were suffering from any chronic health issues, were excluded from the study.</p><p>The healthy diet concluded based on nutritional value. The nutritional value calculated, based on the food present on particular area Garhwal region (green vegetables, pulses, wheat, finger millet, rice, and milk). The consumption of junk food was also including in the dietary habit. It is also categorized into two parts: (1) Junk food intake &#x0003c;3 days/week, (2) junk food intake 4&#x02013;7 days/week. Physical activity calculated in terms of the number of days of regular exercise, household work, and sports per week. Physical exercise categorized into two: (1) &#x0003c;2 days of physical work per week and (2) 3&#x02013;7 days of physical work per week.</p><p>Regarding menstrual abnormalities, girls were asking to date their Menarche. The questions regarding the menstrual pattern concerned duration of the most recent menstrual intervals, average days of bleeding, and regarding menstrual problem and their frequency with menstrual abnormalities.</p><p>Chi-square test was applied to compare the dietary and exercise patterns among students having menstrual disorders and those who do not have menstrual disorders.

Most of the participants in this region were belongs to middle-class families. With the support of the schools, a very positive response observed for most of the questions. This study attempted to find a relation between various lifestyle factors such as eating junk food, healthy food, and lack of physical activities with the menstrual problems experienced by the adolescent girls.</p><p>In previous, it would be thought that menstrual abnormalities are found higher in metropolitan cities as compared to small hilly towns due to lifestyle pattern. Now, this study highlights that due to globalization, lifestyle pattern change in everywhere, which was affecting adolescent in every way. Yet, the age of menarche in Garhwal population show lower (13.5) compared to European and Western countries.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Most of the studies showed the menarcheal age stabilized at the age of 12 to13 year.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The lower age of menarche could explain that the variation in age of menarche change according to the hereditary pattern, nutritional status, and climate difference.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The result suggested that the dysmenorrhea is the highest among all menstrual abnormalities in a mountainous region, which support the fact that dysmenorrhea is common among 70%&#x02013;90% adolescent girls[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] globally.

In this study, the majority of the girls, skipping their breakfast and associated with higher consumption of junk food. Dysmenorrhea was considerably higher in girls who were consistently eating fast food. Because junk foods are rich in saturated fatty acids, and these acids affect the metabolism of progesterone in the menstrual cycle.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Junk foods also lack micronutrients, which might be responsible for triggering dysmenorrhea, premenstrual symptoms, and menstrual irregularities. Nowadays, skipping breakfast is common habits among in adolescent, this pattern shows in Garhwali population also, which leads obesity[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and menstrual abnormalities.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The diet limitation and skipping breakfast lead gynecological problems[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] specifically the hormonal changes which cause menstrual disorders in most of the females.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This study clearly indicates that dysmenorrhea not only affected by the dietary habit but also with the physical activity. This study supporting the fact that there was a positive correlation between the lower risk of dysmenorrhea and followed regular exercise and healthy physical activity for adolescent girls.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A bunch of studies in nursing students also revealed that menstrual disorders are very common in adolescent girls and regular exercise and improved dietary habits are essential to prevent menstrual abnormalities.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In this study, premenstrual symptoms were present high in those girls who were not doing regular physical work. The PMS and physical work association also showed in school going girls of Pondicherry, India.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Other parts of worlds also showed similar kind of associations between positive diagnosis of PMS and lower level of physical work.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The physical activities release more endorphins hormones, which can decrease the PMS symptoms such as pain, depression, and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In the present scenario, menstrual abnormalities are causing significant debility in adolescent girls. Self-medication was practiced by 42% of the adolescent girls, which indicate dysmenorrhea affecting the maximum population of adolescent girls. The study showed that routine activities, school absentees, and emotional distress were due to dysmenorrhea and PMS. Sickness absenteeism is notably more among dysmenorrheic girls, this conclusion also finds by other studies.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Even Bergsjo's study in the USA disclosed that sickness absenteeism because of dysmenorrhea causes wastage of millions of dollars due to suffering work satisfaction, personal relationships, confidence, and concentration at workplaces.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Some other studies also show that dysmenorrhea and PMS were perceived as the most stressful symptoms leading to school absenteeism and household activities in girls.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Overall, there is a significant association present between consumption of junk food, dieting,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and physical exercise with an abnormal flow.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Hence, the changing lifestyle patterns such as eating junk food and reducing physical activities are directly affecting the menstrual cycle of females. Hence, it is important to promote the health education programs which should include promoting adequate dietary habit, regular exercise, and awareness on menstrual hygiene in school level for improving the menstrual health. The improvement of menstrual health is important for preventing the many present and future gynecological problems (infertility, obesity, and polycystic ovaries).</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rigon</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>De Sanctis</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernasconi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bianchin</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bona</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bozzola</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Menstrual pattern and menstrual disorders among adolescents: An update of the Italian data</article-title><source>Ital J Pediatr</source><year>2012</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>38</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22892329</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deligeoroglou</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Creatsas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Menstrual disorders</article-title><source>Endocr Dev</source><year>2012</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>160</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22846527</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>LK</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaur</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Menstruation among adolescent girls in Malaysia: A cross-sectional school survey</article-title><source>Singapore Med J</source><year>2006</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>869</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16990962</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deligeoroglou</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsimaris</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Deliveliotou</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Christopoulos</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Creatsas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Menstrual disorders during adolescence</article-title><source>Pediatr Endocrinol Rev</source><year>2006</year><volume>3</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>150</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16641850</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Skipping breakfast is associated with dysmenorrhea in young women in Japan</article-title><source>Int J Food Sci Nutr</source><year>2003</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>505</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14522696</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Awaji</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Sakamoto</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakata</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Skipping breakfast adversely affects menstrual disorders in young college students</article-title><source>Int J Food Sci Nutr</source><year>2009</year><volume>60</volume><issue>Suppl 6</issue><fpage>23</fpage><lpage>31</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rupa Vani</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Veena</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Subitha</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hemanth Kumar</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bupathy</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Menstrual abnormalities in school going girls &#x02013;
