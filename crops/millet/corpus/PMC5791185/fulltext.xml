The association between optimal infant feeding practices and diarrhoea has been reported elsewhere, but the evidence has been limited to promote and advocate for strategic interventions in Tanzania. This study examined the association between infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and diarrhoea in Tanzanian children under 24&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study used the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey data to estimate the prevalence of diarrhoea stratified by IYCF practices. Using multivariable logistic regression modelling that adjusted for confounding factors and cluster variability, the association between IYCF practices and diarrhoea among Tanzanian children was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Diarrhoea prevalence was lower in infants aged 0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;months whose mothers engaged in exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and predominant breastfeeding (PBF) compared to those who were not exclusively and predominantly breastfed. Infants aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months who were introduced to complementary foods had a higher prevalence of diarrhoea compared to those who received no complementary foods, that is, infants who were exclusively breastfed at 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months. Infants who were exclusively and predominantly breastfed were less likely to experience diarrhoea compared to those who were not exclusively and predominantly breastfed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16&#x02013;0.59, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for EBF and AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.30, 95% CI 0.10&#x02013;0.89, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.031 for PBF]. In contrast, infants aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months who were introduced to complementary foods were more likely to experience diarrhoea compared to those who received no complementary foods (AOR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.91, 95% CI 1.99&#x02013;4.27, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The study suggests that EBF and PBF were protective against diarrhoeal illness in Tanzanian children, while the introduction of complementary foods was associated with the onset of diarrhoea.

The early year period also reflects a time of high vulnerability of the child to various adverse health outcomes such as diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the past two decades, significant progress has been made in reducing diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality among children under 5&#x000a0;years old; however, recent reports have shown that diarrhoea is still a leading cause of under-five mortality in many developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, including Tanzania, children are likely to die before their fifth birthday from illnesses such as diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infection compared to their counterparts in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, under-five deaths in developing countries are mainly attributable to preventable infectious diseases (including diarrhoea) in which appropriate breastfeeding, improved water and sanitation, routine vaccination programs and strong operational policies can play significant roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Optimal breastfeeding practices protect children against diarrhoea-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and mothers who optimally breastfeed their babies have been shown to have a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast and ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent review indicated that only approximately 40% of infants aged 0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;months in SSA countries were exclusively breastfed, reflecting gaps in optimal infant feeding practices in many communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The study also suggested that many infants were introduced to complementary foods too early in SSA countries. While the introduction of complementary foods to infants is crucial for infant growth and development, previous studies have indicated that the poor conditions in which those foods are prepared, stored or fed to the child as well as the immunological status of the child may contribute to the onset of diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previous reports from Tanzania have indicated that the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year was high (50 and 92%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and the median duration of any breastfeeding was 21&#x000a0;months, suggesting that some mothers exclusively breastfed for more than 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nonetheless, the relationship between EBF and continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year and diarrhoea has not been investigated in Tanzania.</p><p id="Par14">In 2016, the global burden of disease study indicated that diarrhoeal diseases contributed to the burden of under-five deaths and disabilities, which accounted for 5.4% of the total deaths and 5.9% of disability-adjusted life years in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, the prevalence of diarrhoea among children under 5&#x000a0;years varied from 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to 22% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] in Tanzania. Studies that investigated the impact of infant feeding practices on diarrhoea in SSA (e.g. Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) and Asia (e.g. Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) have been published, where EBF was protective against diarrhoeal illness. However, evidence on the association between infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and diarrhoea has been limited in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], where studies have primarily focused on HIV-exposed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">A country-specific study that is focused on the relationship between IYCF practices and diarrhoea would be essential to public health experts to promote and advocate for strategic investments in IYCF programmes to improve child health outcomes in Tanzania. Additionally, public health programmes are largely funded by international agencies in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and findings from this study will also be of interest internationally, particularly in the context of the renewed focus on child nutrition agenda at the global, regional and national levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The present study aimed to investigate the association between IYCF practices (i.e. EBF; early/timely initiation of breastfeeding; predominant breastfeeding; timely introduction of solid, semi-solid and soft foods and continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year) and diarrhoea in Tanzanian children under 24&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources</title><p id="Par16">The study used the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS, 2010) data, collected by the National Bureau of Statistics, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, with technical assistance from the Inner City Fund (ICF) International, Maryland, USA.

Using standardised face-to-face questionnaires, the TDHS collected information on IYCF practices from eligible women of childbearing age (15&#x02013;49&#x000a0;years). For the IYCF practices, questions in the survey tool included information on breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, as well as duration and diversity of the infant food provided.

The prevalence of diarrhoea was higher in children who continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year compared to those who had ceased breastfeeding at the same age. Children who were bottle-fed had a higher prevalence of diarrhoea compared to those who were not bottle-fed. Similarly, the prevalence of diarrhoea was higher in infants aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months who received complementary foods compared to those who did not, that is, infants who were exclusively breastfed at 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months. Our analyses revealed that EBF and PBF were protective against diarrhoeal illness in Tanzanian children aged 0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;months, after adjustment for confounding variables. In contrast, infants aged 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months who received complementary foods were approximately three times more likely to experience diarrhoea compared to those who received no complementary foods.</p><p id="Par36">The study showed that the prevalence of diarrhoea was higher among infants who were not exclusively breastfed. Also, the likelihood of an infant aged under 6&#x000a0;months to experience diarrhoea was higher among those not exclusively breastfed compared to those who were exclusively breastfed. This finding is consistent with evidence from other developing countries, including Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Vietnam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], where EBF was protective of diarrhoeal illness among infants of the same age, even after adjusting for poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 18 studies also reported the protective effects of EBF in reducing the burden of diarrhoeal illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Reasons for the protective effect of EBF on diarrhoea are based on the fact that EBF limits the infant&#x02019;s exposure to contaminated liquids and foods, as well as the immunological activities of breast milk to protect the infant&#x02019;s gastrointestinal tract from invading micro-organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, studies have reported that breast milk also stimulates the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and epigenetic programme of the infant, activities which are also essential for the prevention of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Our study suggested that PBF was protective against diarrhoea among Tanzanian children, and this was consistent with previous studies from Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and other SSA countries with high diarrhoea mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, studies from developing countries (such as Ethiopia and Burkina Faso) have shown that PBF increased the likelihood of the infant to experience diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] as parents or caregivers often insist that water&#x02014;often &#x02018;unimproved&#x02019; and a primary source of infection&#x02014;induces suckling or quenches an infant&#x02019;s thirst after breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Although PBF has the potential to increase the likelihood of the infant to experience diarrhoea because of the introduction of food-based fluids, Rajiv and colleagues have argued that promoting both EBF and PBF may be more beneficial than promoting EBF over PBF. The authors also noted that there is limited evidence to differentiate the benefits of EBF from those of PBF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our analysis underscores the fact that both EBF and PBF may have similar impacts on diarrhoea prevention among children aged 0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;months in Tanzania. Nevertheless, efforts must be made to promote EBF over PBF as the possibilities of water or water-based food contamination in Tanzania are high because of limited access to improved drinking water source, improved sanitation and high-quality food storage facilities for mothers from low SES group and those living in urban slums or rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The study showed that continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year and bottle feeding were associated with a higher likelihood of the infant to experience diarrhoea, but the relationship was not statistically significant. Previous studies reported that continued breastfeeding at 1&#x000a0;year and bottle feeding were associated with an increased likelihood of the child to experience diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Importantly, the impact of continued breastfeeding and bottle feeding on diarrhoea could be attributed to the introduction of contaminated complementary food/water or use of a contaminated bottle with a teat or nipple given the age intervals used in assessing those indicators correspond to a time when the infant has commenced complementary foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similarly, the WHO considers bottle feeding as a breastfeeding indicator because of the association between bottle feeding and increased diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The present study suggested that timely introduction of solid, semi-solid, and soft foods was associated with an increased likelihood of the infant to experience diarrhoea. Prior studies have shown that the introduction of complementary foods in many developing countries (including Tanzania) predisposes the infant to experience diarrhoea because of the unsafe conditions in which the foods are handled, prepared and stored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and this may be the case in our study. In Tanzania, maize is the most commonly used complementary foods for infants, but maize and maize-based foods have been shown to contain a high concentration of fumonisin&#x02014;a diarrhoea causing mycotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A number of locally relevant approaches have been suggested to limit the infants&#x02019; exposure to high concentration of fumonisin-contaminated maize in Tanzania. These include maize sorting, dehulling of maize (removal of the hull from the seed) or limiting the daily intake of maize and/or replacing maize with other less fumonisin-contaminated cereal such as sorghum or finger millet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, there are significant challenges to the full implementation of those strategies. For example, resource constraint farmers are unwilling to sort out low-quality maize from their annual harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] or the household preference for the whole maize instead of the dehulled maize product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Our finding implies that mothers should not only be encouraged to timely introduce complementary foods to their infants but also childhood nutrition intervention strategies must ensure that those foods are safe and nutritionally balanced, consistent with the WHO recommendation.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Policy implications</title><p id="Par40">Our study has policy and practical implications for public health experts, decision-makers and researchers as it further highlights the important role of IYCF practices in the context of diarrhoeal disease in a developing country. Accordingly, facility-based interventions such as Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) to adequately promote and support optimal IYCF practices are essential to reduce diarrhoea burden. However, a report from Tanzania has shown that the BFHI is weak. That is, of the 3600 maternity service centres in the country, only 18 health facilities were certified baby friendly centres in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], indicating that many health facilities and professionals may be unaware of the BFHI. This gap in the full implementation of the BFHI&#x02014;shown to promote and support optimal IYCF behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]&#x02014;suggests that more work is needed to improve breastfeeding behaviours of Tanzania mothers. Broadening the BFHI in Tanzania will not only improve EBF and reduce diarrhoea morbidity and mortality but could also increase household productivity due to a reduction in child sick days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Furthermore, the World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative for Tanzania reported that the national-level policy framework and programme coordination to promote and support breastfeeding practices are &#x02018;adequate&#x02019;. Nevertheless, the full implementation of breastfeeding programmes at the health facility and community levels, as well as linkages between breastfeeding programmes at the national and subnational levels, are fragile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Interventions to improve IYCF practices and reduce diarrhoea burden in Tanzania should include improvement in IYCF information for health professionals at the health system level, strengthening the routine postnatal care follow-up for mothers (such as subsidised or free maternal health care services) and scaling up community-based strategies (such as Baby-Friendly Community Initiatives, BFCI, and reinforcing linkages between facility and community-based programmes). Strengthening compliance with the Employment and Labour Relations Act 2004 and increasing domestic funding for IYCF programmes will also have impacts on breastfeeding practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. A detailed description of those facility- and community-based initiatives to improve IYCF behaviours in Tanzania has been noted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In 2016, the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania launched the National Multisectoral Nutrition Action Plan (NMNAP) for the years spanning 2016&#x02013;2021, with the improvement of breastfeeding practices and the introduction of complementary foods being part of the rationale for this initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Since the 1960s, Tanzania&#x02019;s commitment to improving childhood nutrition has been long-lasting. However, the issue has been to translate the government commitment into evidence-based interventions that are appropriately financed, well-implemented and tracked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. To reduce the burden of diarrhoea associated with the introduction of complementary foods in Tanzania, a number of strategic approaches will be needed. These may include increased translation of government commitment to well-resourced and well-coordinated, measurable and culturally appropriate initiatives, and collaborative efforts between government agencies (such as health, agriculture and education) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and industry partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] to reduce the contamination associated with complementary foods. Additionally, studies that investigate the nutritional status of children may be warranted to inform childhood nutrition initiatives and policies in Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par43">A number of methodological limitations should be considered. First, the study used cross-sectional data, and the establishment of a clear temporal association between IYCF and diarrhoea cannot be measured because the data were collected simultaneously. Second, the exposure and outcome variables were based on self-report, and this is a source of recall or measurement bias. The analysis may have overestimated or underestimated the association between IYCF practices and diarrhoea as the mother may have incorrectly reported the number of loose stools passed by the child. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with previous evidence from developing countries on IYCF practices and diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Third, unmeasured confounding factors such as the impact of culture, and family structure and dynamics may be a limitation of the study. Fourth, data on the duration and severity of diarrhoea were unavailable, information that would have provided an in-depth understanding on the scope of protection from EBF and PBF and the pattern of diarrhoea in the context of IYCF practices. Finally, seasonal patterns exist for diarrhoea in SSA countries (including Tanzania) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, our study was limited to calendar years. Using monthly data would have provided better and detailed findings.</p><p id="Par44">Despite the limitations, the study has strengths. First, we believe that the potential impact of selection bias is unlikely to affect the study findings given the nationally representative sample of participants and the subsequent response rate (96%). Second, the study used the TDHS data, which were collected with standardised questionnaires to ensure similarities across geographies in Tanzania. Finally, the study provides additional evidence on the impact of optimal IYCF practices on diarrhoea&#x02014;the second most common cause of deaths among children under 5&#x000a0;years&#x02014;to continue the advocacy for interventions that seek to promote child survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">The study found that diarrhoea prevalence was higher among children whose mothers practised suboptimal IYCF in Tanzania.
