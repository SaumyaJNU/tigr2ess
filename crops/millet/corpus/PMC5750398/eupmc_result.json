    "Lassa virus (LASV) is an arenavirus whose entry into host cells is mediated by a glycoprotein complex (GPC) comprised of a receptor binding subunit, GP1, a fusogenic transmembrane subunit, GP2, and a stable signal peptide. After receptor-mediated internalization, arenaviruses converge in the endocytic pathway, where they are thought to undergo low-pH-triggered, GPC-mediated fusion with a late endosome membrane. A unique feature of LASV entry is a pH-dependent switch from a primary cell surface receptor (α-dystroglycan) to an endosomal receptor, lysosomal-associated membrane protein (Lamp1). Despite evidence that the interaction between LASV GP1 and Lamp1 is critical, the function of Lamp1 in promoting LASV infection remains poorly characterized. Here we used wild-type (WT) and Lamp1 knockout (KO) cells to show that Lamp1 increases the efficiency of, but is not absolutely required for, LASV entry and infection. We then used cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell surface fusion assays to demonstrate that LASV GPC-mediated fusion occurs at a significantly higher pH when Lamp1 is present compared to when Lamp1 is missing. Correspondingly, we found that LASV entry occurs through less acidic endosomes in WT (Lamp1-positive) versus Lamp1 KO cells. We propose that, by elevating the pH threshold for fusion, Lamp1 allows LASV particles to exit the endocytic pathway before they encounter an increasingly acidic and harsh proteolytic environment, which could inactivate a significant percentage of incoming viruses. In this manner Lamp1 increases the overall efficiency of LASV entry and infection.IMPORTANCE Lassa virus is the most clinically important member of the Arenaviridae, a family that includes six additional biosafety level 4 (BSL4) hemorrhagic fever viruses. The lack of specific antiviral therapies for Lassa fever drives an urgent need to identify druggable targets, and interventions that block infection at the entry stage are particularly attractive. Lassa virus is only the second virus known to employ an intracellular receptor, the first being Ebola virus. Here we show that interaction with its intracellular receptor, Lamp1, enhances and upwardly shifts the pH dependence of fusion and consistently permits Lassa virus entry into cells through less acidic endosomes. We propose that in this manner, Lamp1 increases the overall efficiency of Lassa virus infection."
