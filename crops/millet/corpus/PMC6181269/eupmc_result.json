    "OBJECTIVE:To determine if a protein-calorie supplement (PCS) plus a micronutrient supplement (MNS) improves outcomes for HIV-infected lactating women and their infants. DESIGN:Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING:Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS, PARTICIPANTS:Pregnant HIV-infected women enrolled in PMTCT programs who intended to breastfeed for 6 months. INTERVENTION:Randomization 1:1 to administration of a PCS plus MNS versus MNS alone among 96 eligible women beginning in the third trimester and continuing for 6 months of breast-feeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):Primary: infant weight at 3 months. Secondary: maternal BMI at 6 months. RESULTS:PCS resulted in significant increases in daily energy intake compared to MNS at all time points (range of differences: +388-719 Kcal); and increases in daily protein intake (range of differences: +22-33 gm). Infant birth weight (excluding twins) was higher in the PCS than MNS groups: 3.30 kg vs 3.04 kg (p = 0.04). Infant weight at 3 months did not differ between PCS and MNS groups: 5.63 kg vs 5.99 kg (p = 0.07). Maternal BMI at 6 months did not differ between PCS and MNS groups: 24.3 vs 23.8 kg/m2 (p = 0.68). HIV transmission occurred in 0 infants in the PCS group vs 4 in the MNS group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:In comparison to MNS the PCS + MNS intervention was well tolerated, increased maternal energy and protein intake, and increased infant birth weight, but not weight at 3 months or maternal BMI at 6 months. Reduced infant HIV transmission in the PCS + MNS group was observed. TRIAL REGISTRATION:Clinical Trials.Gov NCT01461863."
