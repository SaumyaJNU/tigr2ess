Gambella is one of the regions of Ethiopia that attracts large-scale agricultural investments that extensively drive land use and cover changes in the region. The aim of this study is to examine the rate, extent and distribution of various land use and cover changes in Gambella Regional State, Ethiopia, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis is mainly based on Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2A satellite images and fieldwork. Two Landsat Thematic Mapper and a Sentinel 2A image were used for determining the maximum likelihood of land use/cover classification. The results show that farmland decreased by 26 km<sup>2</sup> from 1987 to 2000; however, during the last two decades, agricultural land area increased by 599 km<sup>2</sup>, mainly at the cost of tropical grasslands and forests. We found that areas cultivated by smallholder farmers increased by 9.17% from 1987 to 2000. However, small-scale farm activities decreased by 7% from 2000 to 2017. Areas cultivated by large-scale state farms totalled 202 km<sup>2</sup> in 1987; but by 2000, this large-scale state farming had been completely abandoned by the state, and as a result, its land use has decreased to zero. Despite this, in 2017 large-scale farming increased to 746 km<sup>2</sup>. In addition, Gambella National Park, which is the nation's largest national park and ecosystem, was also largely affected by Land Use and Land Cover changes. The conversion of savannah/tropical grasslands to agricultural farmland has caused varied and extensive environmental degradation to the park. The Land Use and Land Cover changes in the Gambella region are discussed on the basis of underlying socioeconomic factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Environmental science</kwd><kwd>Earth sciences</kwd><kwd>Geography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Land Use and Land Cover changes (LULCC) involves either a shifting to a different land use or an intensification of existing land <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Currently, across the world, an increasing demand for space for settlement, agricultural investment and industrial activities is being observed [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This leads to unprecedented LULCC, and these have caused both socioeconomic and environmental problems <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Human use of land has had a profound effect upon the natural environment resulting in an observable pattern in Land Use and Land Cover (LU/LC) over time [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamics and mechanisms of LULCC during the last 30 years in the Gambella region in the southwest of Ethiopia, where the LU/LC dynamics are the largest in the country [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">In Ethiopia and especially in the Gambella region, the pace of change in LU/LC depends on three main factors: resettlement, population growth and increasing agricultural land pressure [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All three factors have own contribution for the LULCC. Between 1983 and 1985, the worst famine in the country's history led to the deaths of more than 400,000 people. After this drought, the Ethiopian government, Derg (the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police and Territorial Army that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991), made and carried out resettlement plans to relocate the rural population with the principal strategy of ensuring food security <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the mid-1980s, nearly 800,000 people were relocated, mostly from the northern highlands to distant areas in the southwest, including the Gambella region <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. As a result, LULCC have heavily modified the natural landscape of the Gambella region, and large areas across the region have been deforested and/or drained <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Similarly, in the 2000s the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) took the voluntary villagization scheme (VVS) as a strategy to transform the livelihood of settlers and ensure food security by providing socioeconomic and infrastructural delivery, and solving the problems created by the Derg on a voluntarily basis through an intra-regional approach. This resettlement programme, that has been ongoing since the 1980s, has caused a large shift in population into the Gambella region. According to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2015), the total population of the Gambella region rose from 182,000 in 1994, to 307,000 in 2007, and to 409,000 in 2015. This rising population over the years has created considerable pressure on the land and its natural resources, including its forests and water <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The Gambella region has both a unique ecology and an extraordinarily rich biodiversity. At the same time, the level of resource use in the Gambella region is still comparatively low. This explains why the main mechanism of LULCC in the Gambella region is agricultural land expansion <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Besides the spread of small-scale farming as a result of the population increase, one of the main agricultural development policies is large-scale farming investment. It is promoted by the Ethiopian government as part of an infrastructure expansion and economic stabilisation programme. Since 2005, the country, as well as the Gambella region, saw a surge of domestic and foreign investment into commercial farming. From the late 1990s to the end of 2008, almost 3.5 million hectares of land were transferred to both domestic and foreign investors, mainly in the southwestern part of Ethiopia <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Because of its favourable environmental conditions, the Gambella region has attracted large-scale agricultural investment. During the same period, both the federal and regional government have awarded 1.1 million hectares of suitable farmland in the Gambella region to foreign and local companies/investors. Since 2008, Gambella has become the major target point for foreign investors.</p><p id="p0025">These developments, which began in the 1980s and are still ongoing, have a major impact on the magnitude and nature of LULCC in the Gambella region and throughout the whole of Ethiopia. It is therefore highly relevant to assess and understand LULCC in this region. Existing studies so far have mainly focused on either deforestation or LULCC in specific districts of the Gambella region <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">A complete picture of LULCC in the entire Gambella region, from the mid-1980s to the present day, does not exist to the best of the authors' knowledge. Therefore, the overall objective of this paper is to examine the rate, extent and distribution of various LULCC coverages in Gambella Regional State. This also includes a contribution, as a first step, to documenting LU intensity changes in the region by identifying and analysing the rate of small-scale and commercial agricultural land expansions and their overall extent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study area</title><p id="p0035">Gambella region is one of nine administrative regions in the western part of Ethiopia (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).

<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is located between 6&#x000b0;28&#x02032;38&#x02033; to 8&#x000b0;34&#x02032; North Latitude and 33&#x000b0; to 35&#x000b0;11&#x02032;11&#x02033; East Longitude.

The region is comprised of three administrative zones (Anyuak, Nuer and Majang) and 13 districts (woredas), one special district and one city administration <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Gambella is one of the emerging regions in Ethiopia. Its economy is predominantly based on agriculture with mixed farming among the Anyuak and Majang people and agro-pastoral among the Nuer people <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The region lacks infrastructure with a poor transportation network among the districts (woredas).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Locational map: Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and Regional States boundary (left) and Gambella Regional State (right).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig.&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0040">The Gambella region lies within the hot to warm humid lowland agro-ecological zone. The topography divides the Gambella region into two broad sub-regions, which are between 900 to 2200 masl (metres above sea level) and the flood plains below 500 masl. Its climate is classified as tropical savannah (Aw) by K&#x000f6;ppen and Geiger <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> with an average temperature of 27.6 &#x000b0;C and 1,197 mm of average annual precipitation <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The rainy season starts at the end of April and lasts until October with the maximum rainfall in July <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, there are two main harvesting times known as Meher and Belg. In the Meher, crops are harvested from September to February and in the Belg, crops are harvested from March to August. Baro, Gilo, Akobo, and Alwero are the main rivers crossing the region <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The Gambella region, due to favourable soil, topography and climate conditions, is known to be one of the most fertile regions in Ethiopia and is suitable for growing various types of crops. The region has very high crop suitability compared to other parts of Ethiopia <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Crop suitability, abundant water resources, unused/underutilised land and Ethiopian government policy (Agriculture Development Led Industrialisation) are the main facilitating factors for the expansion of large-scale commercial farming in the region.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Remote sensing data processing and analysis</title><p id="p0045">In order to analyse LULCC in the Gambella region, medium resolution satellite remote sensing data from the Landsat and SENTINEL-2 sensors were selected, covering the period from the mid-1980s to the present. Multi-temporal satellite imagery plays a vital role in quantifying spatial and temporal LULCC in the area <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. LULCC maps were determined from the selected images through a number of consecutive digital processing steps ranging from image selection and download, pre-processing, classification using known training sites, validation using a separate set of known validation sites, classification post-processing and map as well as change map production. The spatial map resolution is 30 m in the case of Landsat TM and 10 m in the case of Sentinel-2 images <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" id="intref0010">https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/</ext-link>). This medium resolution satellite imagery offers the potential for an accurate land cover classification and pattern analyses <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> for the detection and quantification of historical LULCC, especially in remote regions <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> such as the Gambella region where not many data on present LULCC are currently available. Multispectral satellite images of the region were selected for the three years of 1987, 2000 and 2017. Care was taken to select the images to match their phenological periods as closely as possible in order to note the changes in vegetation development. At the same time the images acquired were from the period immediately after the dry season in order to be able to observe the whole range of active vegetation and to avoid investigating dried up vegetation, which cannot be separated into LULCC categories. This being a vital prerequisite for detecting the full range of categories and later comparison of the spatial extent of the classified LULCC categories, it nevertheless limits the number of available images. Based on these considerations Landsat and Sentinel 2a images from January and February 1987, 2000 and 2017 respectively were selected and downloaded (as illustrated in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all the listed images from each year were mosaicked and then clipped based on the Gambella feature, before being processed and classified).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Dates and scene ID number of Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2a images used.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Day and month</th><th>Scene/tile</th><th>Entity ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="5">1987</td><td>13/Jan</td><td align="right">171/054</td><td>LT05_L1TP_171054_19870113_20170215</td></tr><tr><td>13/Jan</td><td align="right">171/055</td><td>LT05_L1TP_171055_19870113_20170215</td></tr><tr><td>20/Jan</td><td align="right">172/054</td><td>LT05_L1TP_172054_19870120_20170215</td></tr><tr><td>20/Jan</td><td align="right">172/055</td><td>LT05_L1TP_172055_19870120_20170215</td></tr><tr><td>22/Jan</td><td align="right">170/055</td><td>LT05_L1TP_170055_19870122_20170215</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">2000</td><td>01/Jan</td><td align="right">171/054</td><td>LT05_L1TP_171054_20000101_20170908</td></tr><tr><td>01/Jan</td><td align="right">171/055</td><td>LT05_L1TP_171055_20000101_20170908</td></tr><tr><td>24/Jan</td><td align="right">172/054</td><td>LT05_L1TP_172054_20000124_20171214</td></tr><tr><td>24/Jan</td><td align="right">172/055</td><td>LT05_L1TP_172055_20000124_20171214</td></tr><tr><td>27/Feb</td><td align="right">170/055</td><td>LT05_L1GS_170055_20000227_20171214</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">2017</td><td>05/Jan</td><td align="right">T36NWP</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170105T080312_N0204_R035_T36NWP_20170105T081256.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>05/Jan</td><td align="right">T36NYP</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170105T080312_N0204_R035_T36NYP_20170105T081256.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>05/Jan</td><td align="right">T36PWQ</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170105T080312_N0204_R035_T36PWQ_20170105T081256.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>15/Jan</td><td align="right">T36NXN</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170115T080251_N0204_R035_T36NXN_20170115T081421.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>15/Jan</td><td align="right">T36NXP</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170115T080251_N0204_R035_T36NXP_20170115T081421.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>15/Jan</td><td align="right">T36NYN</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170115T080251_N0204_R035_T36NYN_20170115T081421.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>15/Jan</td><td align="right">T36PXQ</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170115T080251_N0204_R035_T36PXQ_20170115T081421.SAFE</td></tr><tr><td>15/Jan</td><td align="right">T36PYQ</td><td>S2A_MSIL1C_20170115T080251_N0204_R035_T36PYQ_20170115T081421.SAFE</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0050">The second step of digital image processing consisted, after radiometric image enhancement techniques of the Landsat TM data <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, of a two-stage image classification procedure that included unsupervised Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis (ISODATA) and supervised (Maximum Likelihood) classification <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

For the years 1987 and 2000, no supervised classification training sites with known LU/LC were available. The training sites were therefore selected based on the spectral signature of the classes and, in the case of known stable land uses, through comparison with the known land uses in 2017. For each of the predetermined LU/LC types from the unsupervised approach, training sites were selected and spectral signatures derived. In general, a satisfactory spectral signature is one ensuring that there is &#x02018;minimal confusion&#x02019; among the LU/LC classes to be mapped <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and at the same time covering the spectral variability of the class.</p><p id="p0060">In 2017, through simple random sampling the ground truth data was collected for the supervised classification. This randomness of ground truth data ensures that all parts of the study area have an equal chance of being sampled. Therefore, training sites were identified based on field-collected data using Global Positioning System (GPS), on-field checks of the high-resolution January 2017 Sentinel 2a images, and familiarity with the area. The spectral signatures of the selected LU/LC classes represented by their training areas were then used to produce a Maximum Likelihood Classification of the satellite images. The number of training sites varied from one LU/LC class to another, depending on ease of identification and the level of variability of pixel values within the site. For instance, due to spectrally similarities in water and forest areas, the training sites were set to 60 per class. Whereas, both in farmlands and tropical grasslands, the spectral variability were higher, as result the training site per class were set to 120 and 100 respectively. For more accurate results several training sites for each class located in different parts of the image. The Maximum Likelihood Classification is the most widely used per-pixel method. In addition to the reflectance values, it also takes into account the covariance of the information contained in the sensors' spectral bands of LU/LC classes <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Post classification and accuracy assessment</title><p id="p0065">Post-classification refinement was conducted in order to improve classification accuracy and to reduce the number of erratic misclassifications.

was detected and assessed, and the size and distribution of the altered areas were quantified. The map from the validated classification in 1987 and 2000 using Landsat TM data was compared with the map produced for 2017 using Sentinel 2a, and then a complete matrix of categorical change was obtained. The Sentinel 2 classification result was re-projected and resampled from 10 m to the same 30 m resolution than the classification obtained by Landsat using a majority filter. This allows for comparison of Sentinel and Landsat images at the costs of spatial information of the Sentinel image. Finally, the 1987, 2000 and 2017 supervised classification results were compared using cross-tabulation to quantitatively determine the LU/LC dynamics. A pixel-based comparison was also used to produce quantitative change information.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Methods to classify large-scale commercial and small-scale farmland</title><p id="p0075">The classification results say nothing about farming intensity. Therefore we chose a different approach for the distinction of farming intensity. It is based on the assumption that both the crop type selection and the level of farming intensity in terms of seed selection, use of machinery and fertiliser, as well as pesticide application, is related to field size. Mechanised agriculture allows and demands large field sizes to produce commodities at competitive prices. On the other hand, smallholders without market access and mechanisation cannot manage to work large fields. We masked farmland class from selected satellite imagery from each year and then separated large-scale farmland from small-scale farmland based on land holding size. In addition, high-resolution satellite images (Sentinel 2a) and Google Earth were used as a reference to distinguish small-scale and large-scale commercial farmlands. Finally, depending on a manual digitisation approach on the selected satellite imagery, we extracted large- and small-scale agricultural fields for the years 1987, 2000 and 2017. In Ethiopia, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MOARD) is responsible for large-scale land deals with foreign and local investors <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Since 2008, MOARD has been transferring investment lands ranging from 500 hectares (ha) to a maximum of 5000 ha <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> which is far larger than small-scale farm land size, which is less than 2 ha <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Gambella agricultural office documents and LU/LC maps of the study area were used also to differentiate large-scale commercial farmland from small-scale farmland. In addition to this, in 2017, types of crop-growing by large-scale farmers were identified based on the fieldwork survey (in-situ data) and using the high-resolution (Sentinel 2a) satellite images.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>LULCC classification</title><p id="p0080">As a first result, the accuracy assessment of the supervised LULCC classifications shows an overall accuracy of 82.7% for 1987, 88.4% for 2000 and 94.4% for 2017. The Kappa coefficients for 1987, 2000 and 2017 are 0.78, 0.86 and 0.93 respectively. The higher accuracy of Sentinel is related to the higher resolution of the images.

This class underwent a major shift and was reduced to 41.94% (10,704 km<sup>2</sup>) and 35.70% (9,112 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2000 and 2017 respectively. The other class which faced a decline during the study period was forest land. The area of this class in 1987 was 16.41% (4,188 km<sup>2</sup>) of the total area and in 2000 it showed a slight increase to 17.73% (4,524 km<sup>2</sup>). However, by 2017 it had reduced to 15.50% (3,948 km<sup>2</sup>). The major LULCC was also observed in the wetland vegetated area. Its share increased from 8.05% (2,056 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1987 to 25.21% (6,435 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2000, although it had decreased slightly to 23.32% (5,953 km<sup>2</sup>) by 2017. The wetland area class expansion, which had been observed in the last 30 years, was not due to rainfall variation. In fact, according to World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) data, the average annual rainfall in the Gambella region during 1987 was higher than in 2000 and 2017 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, wetland vegetated area cover in 1987 was lower compared to 2000 and 2017 due mainly to the construction of the Alwero Dam, which started in 1984 and led to the diversion of the Alwero river flow until 1992, reducing the water flow downstream <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. On the other hand, agricultural area showed a slight decrease from 8.31% (2,121 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1987 to 8.21% (2,095 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2000, although by 2017, it had increased to 10.55% (2,694 km<sup>2</sup>). The change in the water class was not very significant, although it did increase during the study period. The share of the total area was 0.04% (11 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1987, 0.21% (53 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2000 and 0.20% (50 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2017. On the other hand, the share of barren or sparsely vegetated land cover shows significant changes, decreasing from 13.30% (3,396 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1987 to 5% (1,279 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2000. Despite this, barren or sparsely vegetated land had increased by 2017 and now covers 13.90% of the total area (3,546 km<sup>2</sup>).

Artificial areas, wetland vegetated areas and forest land increased by 1206%, 213% and 8% respectively. Similarly, open water bodies increased by 382% in 2000. This increase in the share of the water class was mainly related to the Alwero Dam. The dam reservoir now stores 74,600 million cubic metres of water <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Originally, the dam was planned to irrigate a state cotton farm; however, that never materialised <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Lately, however, one of the largest farm companies (Saudi Star) constructed around 30 km of channels to transport the water from the dam to irrigate large rice fields.

In contrast, barren land and farmland increased by 177% and 29% compared to 2000. The expansion of large-scale farming investment in the Gambella region is one of the key factors for the farmland area percentage change.

In addition, tropical grasslands, which covered an area of 3,385 km<sup>2</sup> in 1987, decreased to 2,584 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000 and 1,887 km<sup>2</sup> in 2017. Man-made structures, such as settlements, expanded from about 7 km<sup>2</sup> in 1987 to 101 km<sup>2</sup> in 2000, although they have since decreased to 37 km<sup>2</sup> by 2017. Within the new proposed GNP boundary, however, both agricultural activities and artificial areas are to be restricted.

The study reveals that in the last three decades, tremendous LULCC have been observed in the Gambella region. These LULCC have been caused by a mixture of climatic factors and strong human interference and have impacts on both the natural environment and on people's livelihoods.</p><p id="p0145">The observed trend of expanding agricultural area in Gambella region between 1987 and 2017 is supported by Ethiopian government, since large-scale land investment is an important part of its development strategy <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the 1980s, the previous Ethiopian government, Derg, introduced large state farms in the region. However, in 1991, the state farms collapsed and the farmland was abandoned after the abolition of the Derg government <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Since the mid-2000s, however, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) have handed over previously state-owned farmlands to foreign companies <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As a result, large-scale farming activities have expanded rapidly in the Gambella region within a short period of time.</p><p id="p0150">According to the Ethiopian Investment Agency's official report, from 2004 to 2015 around 185 investors were granted licence to invest in the Gambella region, out of which 22 were foreign investors and the remainder were local investors <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. By 2008, in Gambella alone, MOARD made around 47% or 1.1 million ha of suitable farmland available to large-scale farm companies. Nevertheless, MOARD asserted that while some of the investors are operating their lands wisely the majority are leaving their lands barren and uncultivated. Large-scale commercial farmland expansion threatens the land rights and livelihoods of indigenous communities, and nowadays their land is given for cash crop/monocrop production. For instance, in 2012, the Ethiopian government removed/relocated more than 70,000 indigenous people as a result of large-scale commercial farming activities [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This relocation/resettlement has had a negative impact on small-scale farmland expansion. In the past three decades, small-scale farmland increased by just 29 km<sup>2</sup>, or 1.5%. Although the Central Statistics Agency (CSA) report indicated that population between 2007 and 2015 in Gambella region was increasing at around 4.15% per year, small-scale farmland expansions to meet short-term survival rates are insignificant. According to a World Bank report <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the average land holding size per family in the study area is 1.4 ha, which is less than the average standard land holding size of 2 ha, recommended by the Food and Agriculture organization (FAO) <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Land holding size, land/property rights and food insecurity are therefore the major concerns of small-scale farmers [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since the 2010s, land conflicts and clashes between the two major ethnic groups (Anyuaa and Nuers) have largely increased in the region over farmland <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p id="p0155">The Oakland Institute (2011) conducted a study on the impact of large-scale agricultural investment on local people's livelihoods and LULCC in Gambella Regional State. The findings reveal that investors cleared huge areas of forest by practising the slash-and-burn farming system in their fields <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This is the greatest threat to forest cover, which is the main source of food for the hunter-gatherer indigenous peoples <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In 1987, the total forest cover was 4,188 km<sup>2</sup>; however, in 2000 there was neither state nor large-scale farming investment in the region. As a result, the forest cover increased to 4,524 km<sup>2</sup>. This study also confirmed that the forest cover and large-scale agricultural investment has an indirect/inverse relationship. For instance, forest cover declined when large-scale farm investment was restarted in the region in the mid-2000s and this implies that about 576 km<sup>2</sup> of forest land has disappeared between 2000 and 2017. Recent statistics also indicate that the annual deforestation rate in Ethiopia in general is about 1,410 km<sup>2</sup> per year <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> due to farmland expansion. With this pace of deforestation, the unique forest cover of the Gambella region, with its rich biodiversity, will have disappeared by approximately 2133. This would have a significant impact on the LU/LC ecology and biodiversity through the whole Gambella region.</p><p id="p0160">On the other hand, in 2003, the FDRE established a revitalisation of population relocation strategies of the resettlement and villagisation (R&#x00026;V) programme. This programme resurrected the problems last seen during the Derg regime. As a strategy of transforming the livelihood of settlers and ensuring food security by providing socioeconomic and infrastructural delivery, it is a voluntary principle through an intra-regional approach. Since the mid-2000s, scattered households have been collected together into selected nucleated villages in order to improve their access to social, economic and administrative services in the Gambella region. As a result of this, farmers had to leave their ancestral farmlands and relocate to villages. Thus, according to our findings, about 1,381 km<sup>2</sup> of farmland has been abandoned and re-converted into tropical grasslands because of the R&#x00026;V programme. In the past, a poorly planned resettlement programme leading to uncontrolled encroachments has caused great damage to the vegetation composition and structure of the area <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For instance, resettlement sites were established in the 1980s by clearing dense natural forests.</p><p id="p0165">Our results show that there are strong human interferences within the old boundaries of the national park, as seen e.g. by the farming activities and the decrease of forest land, while within the new boundaries, almost no farming activities were observed in 2017 and also less artificial areas exist in the new boundaries. However, the new boundaries of GNP contain less forest land than in the old boundaries. Besides LU change, we identified large areas of LC change within both, the old and the new boundaries of the GNP. Over 1.498 km<sup>2</sup> of natural grassland has been transformed mainly into wetlands over the last decades. Several studies support our findings within the GNP and identify possible reasons for this development. According to <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> the changes are not only driven by natural processes, but mainly due to human interferences, such as unsustainable utilization of natural resources such as deforestation, commercial farm expansion, and settlement/encroachment, and wild fires. Since the 1990s, the government's land allocations to external agribusiness investors in and around the GNP has threatened the livelihoods of local communities <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and currently the pristine areas of the park are shrinking and suffering widespread damage to plant species and wild animals <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The clearing of land and large-scale deforestation has increased competition for land between investors and local farmers. All these syndromes contradict the idea of a protected area and caused social and economic hardship <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p id="p0170">Since 2015, the Ethiopian government has proposed a new park boundary to make the park more suitable for wildlife conservation and ecosystem management <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. As result, the government is restricting encroachment/settlement and large-scale/commercial farming activities within the new GNP boundary. Recently, the national park has also had the support of foreign-funded programmes, which is taking part in the setting up of a land use plan for the Gambella region <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0175">From the overall research findings, some important conclusions can be drawn. Remote sensing has an outstanding value as an independent and objective source of information on LULCC. In the Gambella resettlement program, demographic growth and large-scale land investment has caused social and environmental impacts, as forests are cleared and communities are displaced, or lose access to farmland, forest or water resources. Particularly, large-scale land investment without proper environmental impact assessments and unplanned resettlement programmes were the cause of enormous LULCC in the Gambella region. Failed resettlement programmes in the 1980s and R&#x00026;V in the mid-2000s led to the re-establishment of grasslands that are important for a rewilding process in the region, which is unique in Ethiopia. This rewilding process in the Gambella region is able to allow indigenous plant species to grow on their own and produce new generations without human intervention.</p><p id="p0180">The results of this research revealed the existence of significant LULCC over the last 30 years. The observed changes varied from one LULCC category to another. This study showed that the expansion of large-scale commercial farmland increased in 2017 compared to 1987. The expansion of small-scale farmland between 1987 and 2017, on the other hand did not show any significant change, and it is less than 2% area change unless one would expect a higher increase to a massive population growth. This shows the dominant influence of commercialisation on agriculture in the region. In addition, barren land has increased considerably during the last two decades. On the other hand, tropical grassland and forest areas are declining at a rapid pace.</p><p id="p0185">The GNP, which is the nation's largest national park ecosystem has also been affected by LULCC. The conversion of tropical grasslands and forest land to large-scale farmland has caused varied and extensive environmental degradation in the GNP, and major negative outcomes for local people's livelihood. For instance, the establishment of the new park boundaries resulted in a loss of large parts of the wetland vegetated area and water bodies. Identifying the complex interaction between changes and its drivers over time is significant in determining future change, setting up decision-making mechanisms and constructing alternative scenarios. Therefore, in future, sustainable development LU/LC has to be monitored at regular intervals and an integrated LU policy is required.</p><p id="p0190">In general, this study advocates the use of multi-temporal and high-resolution satellite data to detect and assess changes in LU/LC comprehensively. Only local field work and the compilation of additional sources can enable the observed changes to be put into a larger perspective, and to be able, finally, to understand the LU/LC dynamics in the Gambella region. This is a necessary prerequisite to formulating successful LU strategies required for the appropriate and sustainable development of the study area.</p><p id="p0195">To sum up, this paper has documented LULCC in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. It quantifies the changes and illuminates reasons and effects. The Gambella region is among the least developed and the most fertile regions of Ethiopia. It has large natural reserves in terms of pristine forests, wetlands, tropical grasslands and biodiversity. At the same time, its future development potentials are large and based on solid indicators like available rainfall, fertile soils and accessible land. Although all documented LULCC during the last decades point towards the usual conversion of natural land into human utilisation, one may also conclude that Gambella region is still far away from a terminal stage of human interference. This opens up the chances to develop and implement policies to ensure the sustainable future development of the Gambella region. It should enforce non-interference into the new GNP boundary in order to protect the remaining pristine areas, develop smallholder agriculture towards larger yields to raise income and at the same time preserve natural areas of wetland and grassland. In addition, large-scale farming should be slowed down and should demonstrate sustainable operations with respect to, e.g. erosion and pollution.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0200">Azeb W Degife: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0205">Florian Zabel, Wolfram Mauser: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0210">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0215">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0220">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ankana</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Land and forest management by land use/land cover analysis and change detection using remote sensing and GIS</article-title><source>J.
