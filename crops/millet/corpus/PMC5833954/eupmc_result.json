    "The vertical treadmill (VertiRun) is an unresearched mode of exercise where users engage in a \"running-like\" action whilst body weight is supported by a recumbent bench and overhanging resistance cables are tethered to the user's ankles. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of training on a VertiRun and any cross-training effect on running performance. Thirty active males (age, 22±4 years; stature, 1.79±0.08 m; body mass, 78.5±12.6 kg) volunteered for this study. Participants' aerobic and anaerobic running performance were determined by incremental maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max) treadmill test and a maximum anaerobic running test (MART), respectively. Participants were matched and then randomly assigned to either a VertiRun group, 20-m shuttle sprint group or control group. The intervention consisted of 4-6, 30-sec all-out efforts with 4-min recovery between bouts, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. The pre- and postintervention VO2max and MART were analysed using a mixed repeated measures analysis of variance. MART increased by 4.5% in the VertiRun group (P=0.006) and 4% in the sprint group (P<0.001). VO2max increased by 6.2% in the VertiRun group (P=0.009) and 5.5% in the sprint group (P=0.020). The MART and VO2max of the control group were unchanged (P=0.910 and P=0.915, respectively). These data suggest that the VertiRun could be an effective cross-training mode for running and could supplement training programmes. Also, as VertiRun is a low-impact exercise it might be useful in the physical preparation of athletes returning to sport following lower limb injury."
