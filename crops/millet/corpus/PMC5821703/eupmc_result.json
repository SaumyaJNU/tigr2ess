    "Pearl millet, (Pennisetum glaucum L.), an efficient (C4) crop of arid/semi-arid regions is known for hardiness. Crop is valuable for bio-fortification combating malnutrition and diabetes, higher caloric value and wider climatic resilience. Limited studies are done in pot-based experiments for drought response at gene-expression level, but field-based experiment mimicking drought by withdrawal of irrigation is still warranted. We report de novo assembly-based transcriptomic signature of drought response induced by irrigation withdrawal in pearl millet. We found 19983 differentially expressed genes, 7595 transcription factors, gene regulatory network having 45 hub genes controlling drought response. We report 34652 putative markers (4192 simple sequence repeats, 12111 SNPs and 6249 InDels). Study reveals role of purine and tryptophan metabolism in ABA accumulation mediating abiotic response in which MAPK acts as major intracellular signal sensing drought. Results were validated by qPCR of 13 randomly selected genes. We report the first web-based genomic resource ( http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/pmdtdb/ ) which can be used for candidate genes-based SNP discovery programs and trait-based association studies. Looking at climatic change, nutritional and pharmaceutical importance of this crop, present investigation has immense value in understanding drought response in field condition. This is important in germplasm management and improvement in endeavour of pearl millet productivity."
