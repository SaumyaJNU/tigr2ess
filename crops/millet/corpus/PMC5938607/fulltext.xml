It can induce vestibulotoxicity characterized by vertigo and dizziness and cochleotoxicity, manifesting as tinnitus and permanent sensorineural hearing impairment and loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence of hearing loss is up to 25% among patients treated with the antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. GTM is used to treat infections in a wide demographic span from adults, to children, to infants including preterm infants. In children and neonates the incidence of cochlear and vestibular toxicity is less than in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The risk of ototoxicity increases when GTM is administered concurrently with other ototoxic drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents, loop diuretics or glycopeptides antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and/or concurrently with noise exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] old age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and in patients with mitochondrial DNA mutation 1555A&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;G. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">Despite its toxic side effects GTM is one of the antibiotics of choice worldwide due to the relatively low cost and its wide spectrum of action comprising many strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. GTM can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Ototoxicity correlates with plasma concentration and duration of the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The symptoms can arise during the drug administration or after the end of the therapy; hence GTM is usually delivered in an inpatient setting when the drug blood level can be routinely monitored. GTM penetrates all cell types of the cochlea, and continues to accumulate in the inner ear even after the termination of its administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Following systemic administration, GTM and the aminoglycosides are presumably trafficked through the endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the cochlear lateral wall into the perilymphatic fluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recent evidences strongly suggest that aminoglycosides may be predominantly trafficked through the blood labyrinth barrier (BLB) into the SV and into the endolymph before entering the cochlear hair cells. Within the inner ear perilymph, plasma concentrations of GTM increase in a time and dose dependent manner. The recognized cellular basis for aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss is the death of mechanosensory cochlear hair cells. Chronic GTM treatment leads to cell loss and reduction of thickness of the stria vascularis (SV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In guinea pigs a single dose of GTM, systemically or locally administered, persists in SL fibrocytes, suggesting that hair cell vulnerability may be influenced by the state of spiral ligament cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood, aminoglycoside antibiotics generate free radicals within the inner ear, damaging sensory cells and neurons and inducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Two major vascular beds form the lateral wall microvasculature of the inner ear, the SV and the SL, deliver about 80% of the blood supply to the cochlea. The SL microvasculature surrounding the SV controls the blood flow directed to the stria vascular bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] through contractile proteins of the SL pericytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Pericytes also control other important functions in the microvasculature physiology such as: maintenance of the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB), signaling pathways to endothelial cells, and modulation of the microvessel wall permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Transport of macromolecules across the BLB via transcytotic and endocytotic mechanisms constitute another likely function of the pericytes in the inner ear. Recently, it has been shown that, in the blood brain barrier (BBB), pericyte signaling to endothelial cells control the vesicular transcytosis through the up- or down-regulation of Mfsd2a protein on the cell surface of endothelial cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Caveolae are cholesterol rich membrane microdomains found on many cell types and particularly abundant on endothelial cells and adipocytes. Pericytes from various microvascular beds have also been described expressing caveolae, transporting small molecules into the cells and unloading cargoes into the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Caveolae are described mainly on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm; they are constituted of cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingolipids and proteins. Caveolae contain constitutive proteins such as caveolin 1 (cav1), caveolin 2 (cav2) and caveolin 3 (cav3). Cav1 is a structural protein essential for caveolae formation observed also in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] in the cytoplasm, and in organelles such as mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Cav1 and cav2 are abundant in non-muscle cells, Cav3 is found in skeletal muscles and in some smooth-muscle cells. Ablation of cav1 or cav3 but not cav2 causes disassembly and loss of caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cochlea and lateral wall schematic. The cochlea is part of the inner ear; it is the organ of hearing. It harbors at its center the membranous labyrinth where the sensory cells reside. The cochlea is a spiral shell-like structure; it is encased in the temporal bone and contains three canals spiraling in two and one half turns. Two of the canals, scala tympani and scala vestibuli are filled with perilymph a fluid similar to the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma ultrafiltrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. A third canal named scala media is separated from scala tympani and scala vestibuli by two membranes rich in tight junctions, the Reissner&#x02019;s membrane and the Basilar membrane respectively. Scala media contains the endolymph a uniquely potassium-rich, positively polarized fluid, originating from the active filtration of the SV. The SV and the SL form the lateral wall of the inner ear, their microvasculature constitutes the blood labyrinth barrier (BLB) and functions with the tissue highly specialized cells to maintain the ionic composition of the endolymph and perilymph. Three different cell types are recognized in the SV; marginal, intermediate and basal cells. The marginal cells (MC) secrete K<sup>+</sup>, they constitute a homogeneous layer of epithelial cells lining the scala media fluid space, connected by tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes. Marginal cells are rich in microvilli on the luminal side and lack a basement membrane on the opposite side, directly associating them with the vasculature beneath them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Intermediate cells (IC) rich in melanin granules intertwine with the marginal cells without reaching the luminal side. Basal cells (BC) are lateral to the intermediate cell layer adjacent to the SL. The SL comprises five types of fibrocytes (I-V). The fibrocytes participate in pumping K<sup>+</sup> out of the perilymph (Type II, IV, and V) and transport it to generate the endochoclear potential in the endolynph (Type I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>].

Proteins of the Rab GTPase family are cellular regulators of vesicular transport and membrane trafficking. In humans, the recognized members of the Rab family account for more than 60 proteins localized in various cellular membranes. Rabs alternate between the active GTP (guanosine triphosphate)-bound and the inactive GDP (guanosine diphosphate)-bound conformation, and participate in specifying transport pathways in the intracellular membrane trafficking system of all eukaryotes. These pathways comprise endocytosis, exocytosis, phagocytosis, recruitment of tethering factors, control of anterograde and retrograde trafficking between membranes and organelles, and the coordination of cargo delivery and membrane recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Finally, proteins relevant for hearing loss have been shown to segregate with caveolae. In particular, in their analysis of proteins associated with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the inner ear cells, Thomas P. and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] identified a number of proteins involved in human nonsyndromic deafness. Nonsyndromic hearing loss is defined as loss occurring without other clinically detectable symptoms. It is characterized by mild-to-profound sensorineural hearing impairment, and it is caused by genetic mutations in proteins expressed in the middle ear, the inner ear or in both. So far, 93 protein-encoding genes linked to nonsyndromic hearing loss have been identified but not all of them are fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Among the characterized nonsyndromic pathologies, one has been shown to result in excessive endocytosis and accumulation of caveolae. Prelingual nonsyndromic autosomic recessive deafness 1 (DFNB1) is caused by mutations in the Gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene encoding for the cochlear gap junction protein connexin 26 (CX26). One of the mutations induces degradation of the gap junction complexes through abnormal accumulation of cav1 and cav2 positive vesicles and increase of endocytosis leading to membrane retrieval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">In this study, it is shown that the administration of GTM to the SL pericytes induces changes in caveolae proteome profile. In particular, proteome changes occur in the association of Rab GTPase proteins, which are master controllers of the intracellular vesicular transport. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that SL pericytes express cav1 and cav2 but not cav3, independently of GTM exposure. Finally, we identified proteins known to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in the caveolae of SL pericytes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par83">The aim of this study is to investigate whether changes occur in the proteins profile associated with caveolae in GTM treated SL pericytes.

The major difference showed by the enrichment analysis in the untreated cells versus the GTM exposed cells is that a bulk of activities involving genetic information processing, occurring between the nucleus and cytoplasmic parts were suppressed.

Areas in the Proteomaps are proportional to the number of proteins in the category as represented in the modified KEGG orthology. To create a Proteomap, a total area is first divided into color-coded polygons representing the top-level categories.The top-level category areas are then subdivided into subcategories where functionally related proteins share common regions.

One member of the sub-family colocalizes with cav3 in endosomes of mouse and human myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p id="Par146">GTM offers an excellent model for studying hearing loss induced by drugs and noise, since both causes have in free radicals, one of the major initiators. Drug-induced and noise-induced hearing losses are the leading causes of hearing impairment and deafness in the world population. The molecular mechanism leading to ototoxicity is not fully elucidated, but reactive oxygen species ROS have been recognized as one of the major culprits. GTM and the related aminoglycoside antibiotics chelate iron, and the resulting iron-aminoglycoside complex is redox-active, catalyzing the formation of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Moreover, increased oxidative stress is associated with both continuous and impulse noise-induced hearing impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. ROS are considered one of the main culprits for noise-induced hearing loss and deafness. Scientific evidence accumulated since the 1990s shows the appearance of increased ROS and other toxic free radicals, such as superoxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>-&#x000b7;</sup> or lipid peroxides, during and after noise exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Antioxidants and iron chelators have been shown to protect against both GTM-induced and noise-induced hearing loss. Administration of alpha lipoic acid, a powerful antioxidant and iron chelator, decreases aminoglycoside induced hearing loss in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In human subjects, pretreatment with alpha lipoic acid has been shown to protect from prolonged acoustic trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Moreover, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl&#x02013;cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor and an antioxidant, and the free radical scavenger agent disodium 2,4-disulfophenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (HPN-07), effectively reduced hearing loss and cochlear hair cell death in rats, when administered after blast exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. NAC has been shown to reduce noise-induced hearing loss in animal models exposed to continuous noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] to protect human subjects from noise-induced cochlear injury in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and to improve GTM-induced ototoxicity in hemodialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. SL pericytes are key cells for studying the damage induced by aminoglycosides and by noise in the cochlear microvasculature. Synergy and signaling between endothelial cells and pericytes is fundamental for the maintenance of the blood labyrinth barrier BLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A damaged BLB may be an entrance route for ototoxic drugs. Hypotheses have been raised about vascular aminoglycoside trafficking through the spiral ligament microvasculature and tissue, reaching the endolymph and ultimately the cochlear hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Leaking capillaries and loss of strong association of pericytes with endothelial cells have been shown in the SV of animals exposed to continuous acoustic trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. SL pericytes encircle endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the SL in a 1:1 to 1:2 ratio, which is similar only to the micro-vessels of the retina 1:1, and the brain 1:5; this is an extremely high ratio compared to most other organs such as the lungs 1:10 and the skeletal muscle 1:100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The intimate contact with the endothelial cells in the spiral ligament microvasculature, suggests a central role for SL pericytes as a bridge between the blood flow, the endothelial cell and the inner ear tissues, suggesting the possibility of intense signaling and metabolite exchange between the two cell types. An important role for SL pericytes is the control of the blood flow in the inner ear microvasculature. SL pericytes contrary to the stria vascularis pericytes, express contractile proteins such as &#x003b1;-SMA, and have shown contractility in response to stimuli in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The ability to contract allows the SL pericytes to regulate the blood flow of the more distal downstream capillaries leading to the SV, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], This is a critical feature for generating the endocochlear potential, which is indispensable for normal hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Pericytes participate in transport across microvasculature, although the role of pericytes in transport and transcytosis in the BLB has been minimally investigated. Early reports described SL pericytes and the BLB sharing similarities with the brain pericytes and with the BBB respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. A recently published work reported the importance of pericytes in the critical control of endothelial cell transcytosis in the brain microvasculature. The Mfsd2a (major-facilitator superfamily domain-containing-2a) protein-encoding gene is selectively expressed in the BBB microvessels. The genetic ablation of Mfsd2a dramatically increases endothelial cell vesicular transcytosis in KO mice, and the transcytosis in endothelial cells, is controlled by pericytes, through the modulation of Mfsd2a expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Because of the similarity of the spiral ligament capillaries to the BBB capillaries, it is plausible to speculate a similar regulatory role for SL pericytes in the control of endothelial cells transcytosis in the BLB. Understanding vesicle transport and transcytosis in SL pericytes can shed light on metabolite uptake and transport through inner ear microvasculature in physiological and pathological situations.</p><p id="Par147">Transcytosis and endocytosis are some of the functional roles of caveolae, specialized and morphologically distinct, cholesterol sphingolipids and protein-rich microdomains, stabilized by caveolin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Caveolae are an entrance point to the cell for albumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], bacteria, viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], DNA-linked peptides and cross-linked polymeric micelles for drug delivery therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Caveolae are present on the plasma membrane as flask shaped microdomains. They can assume complex multi-lobed configurations with tubules linking these assemblies to the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] or exist as vesicles detached from the plasma membrane associated in grape like clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Caveolae are also dynamic structures that have been shown to fuse with early endosome and to form caveosome, late endosome and multivesicular bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Intense caveolae trafficking occurs underneath the plasma membrane in rapid &#x0201c;kiss and run&#x0201d; cycles in which the caveolar coat stays intact and sequesters multivalent sphingolipids bound cargos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Caveolins, a family of hairpin-like palmitoylated integral membrane proteins that oligomerize and bind to cholesterol and sphingolipids identify caveolae. Cav1 and cav2 are ubiquitously expressed, while cav3 expression is restricted to muscle cells. Cav1 serves as a selective marker for caveolae. Cav1 has an unusual high affinity with cholesterol and resists dissociation even with harsh detergents. Cav1 forms oligomeric complexes in the presence of cholesterol contributing to caveolae genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Metabolic depletion of cholesterol or removal of cholesterol from membrane disrupts caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], as does genetic ablation of cav1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The unusual lipid composition of caveolae confers buoyancy, resistance to solubilization by non-ionic detergents such as Triton-X-100 at 4 &#x000b0;C. This property together with the marker cav1 and the distinctive buoyancy, form the basis for caveolae characterization, identification and purification.</p><p id="Par148">In this study the caveolae proteins cav1 and cav2 were not depleted in the SL pericytes during the GTM challenge, showing that GTM did not affect the structural integrity of the caveolar microdomain. The complexity and the dynamism of caveolae interactions in the cells physiology is made evident by the thousands of proteins associated with caveolae and is revealed by the mass spectrometry analysis. The differences in the GO terms enriched in the specifically expressed proteins in the GTM and control dataset show the response of the cell in physiological and pathological conditions. The subsequent analysis of proteins isolated from caveolae with bioinformatics tools revealed important patterns in the overrepresented cellular components and processes.</p><p id="Par149">The gene ontology enrichment analysis of the GTM dataset shows that caveolae activity was significantly found in the cytoplasm and in the cell membranes including vacuoles and vesicles, membrane protein complexes, exosome and mitochondria. Within the &#x0201c;Biological process&#x0201d; ontology the enriched GO categories showed significance for the terms localization and transport which show that caveolae actively participate in movement and transport of proteins, lipids and small molecules in the processes and pathways enriched in the analysis.</p><p id="Par150">Transport and localization to membranes and cytoplasmic component has been described in literature and are known interactions and activities established by caveolae in the cell. Caveolae exist as individual microdomains clustering in stable multi-caveolar assemblies or undergoing continuous cycling of fusion and internalization while trafficking to and from the cell membrane, intracellular vesicles and cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Interestingly, overrepresented GO categories within the &#x0201c;cellular component&#x0201d; ontology included &#x0201c;Extracellular exosome&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Mitochondrion&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par151">The activity of caveolae and cav1 in exosomes has been only recently brought to attention. Exosomes expressing CD63 and cav1 have been described in large amount in plasma of melanoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Caveolae have been shown to participate in uptake and internalization, via endocytosis pathways, of exosomes released from Epstein-Barr virus infected B cells by epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Furthermore dynamin, a component of the caveolae endocytic pathway, participates in the uptake of exosomes containing anthrax toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Exosomes are potent mediators of intercellular communication; the enrichment of the GO category &#x0201c;extracellular exosome&#x0201d; suggests the existence of pathway(s) utilizing caveolae transport for shuttling exosomes loaded with extracellular material in and out of the cell in response to stress during the GTM challenge. Particularly during pathological conditions extracellular material and plasma membrane proteins are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Caveolae and exosome cooperation may serve as a cellular mechanism to enhance protein degradation or removal of damaged cellular material, through their release to cellular autophagocytic machinery or to the extracellular environment as exosomes. Immuno-staining and transmission electron microscopy, have recently show that caveolae and cav1 are expressed in mitochondria of rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], and in mitochondria-associated membranes (MEMs) in hepatocytes, connecting the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Cellular protection from damage induced by a variety of insults has been suggested for the transferring of cav1 between caveolae and mitochondria. Furthermore, it has been shown that the caveolae-mitochondria interaction regulates the adaptation to cellular stress by modulating the structure and function of mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and that cav1 is relevant for mitochondrial functioning and lipids and metabolic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. GTM is known to induce cell disruption and apoptosis in the inner ear increasing ROS, inducing mitochondria oxidative damage and, consequently, hearing loss. The enrichment of the GO category &#x0201c;Mitochondrion&#x0201d;, and the association with caveolae, shows an important synergy between mitochondria and caveolae in GTM induced stress. This suggests the existence of protective mechanisms in place for cell survival and for mitochondria repair and adaptation to stress, in which caveolae and caveolins play an important role as lipids and molecule transporters to and from the mitochondria, in order either to maintain the energy metabolism or to respond to the increased energy demand of the cell.</p><p id="Par152">The enrichments and the visualization analysis in control and GTM uniquely segregating proteins showed dramatic changes in quite different categories, giving for the first time an insight to the complex proteomic alterations associated with the administration of GTM to cells of the inner ear. The bioinformatic data for the GTM proteome show the cells in an active and stressed status where the significant effort seems to reside in energy boosting, protein degradation, biosynthesis, and vesicular transport. The increase of cell metabolic activity, increased amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, upregulated glycolysis, purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, have been described as a consequence of GTM in small colony variants of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Those same processes are observed in our data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1A</xref>, and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In particular, the TCA cycle is essential for a majority of metabolic pathways and its serves as node connecting catabolic energy gaining pathways with anabolic pathways. Its upregulation provides more biosynthetic intermediates and more redox potential in order to gain energy via oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] Interestingly, the category oxidative phosphorylation has been shown in our data only in the proteome of GTM challenged cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>), demonstrating the need for increased energy possibly to counteract the damage of the drug. The bioinformatic data for the control proteome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3A, B</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">C</xref> and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) show that in the healthy cell the caveolae participate in genetic information processing, in transcription, in nucleotides binding and spliceosome activity, in signal transduction, involving nucleus, ribosome, RNA transport, processing and binding, and DNA maintenance. The enriched categories for the cellular component ontology show that nucleic part and nucleus are the most significant, suggesting a novel role for caveolae in transferring and transport of genetic material. Our findings support recent works that contribute to insights for possible alternative of trafficking patterns involving caveolae. Polyplexes formed by polymer-DNA complexes, have been shown to reach the nucleus through a route involving caveolae, in which the polyplexes accumulate into Rab6- labelled Golgi and ER vesicles and ultimately are transported into the nucleus, during ER mediated nuclear envelope reassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown in ovarian carcinoma cells that cav1 associates with the nuclear matrix and with inactive chromatin and colocalize with nuclear inner membrane proteins and promoter sequences participating cell cycle progression, suggesting that cav1 exerts a functional activity mediated by binding to sequences of genes involved in proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The difference in the proteomes of physiological and pathological cell is an attractive target for developing therapies for GTM and noise induced hearing loss. Changes in gene products expression, have been reported in a study using RNA sequencing to evaluate the response of inner ear hair cells to GTM. The study showed that within 3&#x000a0;h of GTM treatment, the mRNA level of more than three thousand genes in the hair cells changed significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Moreover, mice exposed to repeated acoustic blasts showed injury to the auditory cortex and significant alterations in the expression of multiple genes in the brain, known to be involved in age- or noise-induced hearing impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>].</p><p id="Par153">The specifically expressed proteins dataset from GTM treated cells showed that the highest enrichment significance was reached in the GO category &#x0201c;Transferase activity transferring phosphorus&#x0201d;. Proteins in this category encompass all kinase activities participating in the transfer of a phosphorous containing group from one donor to an acceptor, thus activating pathways and cellular processes. The proteins listed in the category are mostly protein kinases and in particular protein serine/threonine kinases. Interestingly, the dynamic properties of caveolae and their transport competence are regulated by kinases. In particular, it has been shown that serine/threonine kinases differentially regulate caveolae short and long distance cycling between the cell surface and intracellular organelles, and that caveolae move more upon kinase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. A molecular switch triggered by kinase activation suggests the increase of caveolae dynamism in GTM treated cells. Caveolae increased transport activity is confirmed in the data of the GOrilla enrichment analysis and is visualized in the Proteomaps, where &#x0201c;Transport&#x0201d; became the dominant subcategory in the top area &#x0201c;Cellular process&#x0201d;. A change of the cycling mode from short to long range, and increased caveolae transport activity and kinase activation are then plausible consequences of GTM administration to the cells.</p><p id="Par154">The identification of proteins uniquely segregating with caveolae during the GTM challenge in the inner ear microvasculature pericytes is formidable knowledge, since those proteins are likely to be expressed predominantly or specifically when the inner ear undergoes ototoxic or noise-induced damage. These proteins are attractive targets, reachable with therapeutic vectors through the bloodstream to the hardly accessible inner ear.</p><p id="Par155">The caveolae-mediated endocytosis process would offer a significant advantage for delivering its load across the cells efficiently, enhancing deep tissue and vascular penetration of its cargo drugs. Activation of the caveolae endocytic pathway has been shown in studies investigating the internalization of co-polymers as potential drug delivery vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p id="Par156">Transport functions are controlled by Rab proteins, which are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking. Activated Rabs switch from a GDP form to a GTP form. Interestingly, phosphate-transferring group was a category enriched in the GTM uniquely expressed proteins suggesting the activation of Rab pathways. Remarkably, only Rab proteins in the GTM dataset and not in control cells were significantly enriched, demonstrating the relevance of the Rab-caveolae cooperation in pathological condition. The increased segregation of Rab proteins with caveolae in GTM treated cells and the significant enrichment of the pool of Rab expressed in the GTM treated vs untreated cells could be considered as a marker of cellular stress for pathological condition such as the GTM administration.</p><p id="Par157">Once activated, Rabs are able to recruit (to different membranes) different sets of downstream effectors responsible for all steps of vesicle trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] which include regulation of vesicular movements, endocytosis, movements of vesicles packaged with cargo proteins, association with motor proteins that facilitate the movement of vesicles along actin, microtubules, cytoskeleton tethering factors that dock vesicles to target compartments for membrane fusion. Each distinct membrane compartment is targeted by a particular set of Rab proteins. Evidence suggests that the Rabs and caveolae share a common path in the cell transport processes. Budded caveolae, can fuse with the early endosome in a Rab5-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In HeLa cells, cholera toxin and simian virus 40 (SV40) are transported to endosomes by caveolar vesicles in a process dependent on Rab5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The coordinated interactions of cav1 and Rab11 regulate the apical recycling compartments in polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In glial cells the human polyomavirus JC virus is sorted from early endosome to a cav1 positive endosomal compartment in a Rab5 dependent step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Overexpression of Rab7 and Rab9 in Niemann-Pick C fibrocytess mediate the Golgi transport of caveolae-internalized glycosphingolipids reducing intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and increasing accumulation of neutral lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The specificity of Rab transport in hearing loss is slowly gaining interest and is still rather scattered. In a study assessing gene expression in guinea pig paraflocculus structure in the cerebellum after acoustic trauma, the protein Rab3A, which is involved in regulation of pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release, showed no changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. A Mutation in the gene TBC1 Domain Family Member 24 (TBC1D24), encoding for a GTPase activating the proteins Rab5 and Rab35, involved in endosome to lysosome trafficking as a mechanism for degrading synaptic vesicles associated proteins, has been shown to cause severe neurodegeneration and deafness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In HEK 293 cells otoferlin, a protein involved in human autosomal recessive deafness, is co-localized and co-expressed with Rab8 contributing with trans-Golgi trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In a recently published study, our group showed that a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of the Rab11 effector Rab11Fip1 is associated with a noise-induced hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. In this study, cells incubated with GTM for 24&#x000a0;h at 1&#x000a0;mg/ml and 5&#x000a0;mg/ml significantly modified the concentration of some of the Rab proteins tested. The significant change in Rab8a, Rab9a, Rab13, Rab3gap2 shows the concentration effect of GTM on a family of transport proteins, that interacts with multiple cell compartments and may influence more significant changes in the cells. A concept recently emerging in Rab biology suggests that compartment conversion in endosome maturation is induced through a change in Rabs and their effector molecules, that ultimately alters membrane function and identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>], and may affect the directional flow of cell cargo transport in the cell.</p><p id="Par158">Rab8a, Rab9a, Rab13, Rab3gap2 share activity in several pathways.

The enrichment showed significance for terms in the categories &#x0201c;Biological process&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Cellular component&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Molecular function&#x0201d;. The enriched terms showed the suppressed activities and functions in the cells once GTM is administered. (DOCX 34&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material>
