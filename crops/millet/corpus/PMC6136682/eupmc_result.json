    "Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder affecting mainly eyes and skeletal and cardiovascular systems. Cardiovascular involvement may lead to life-threatening aortic pathologies including aneurysms and/or dissections. In this report, the authors present images of a patient with Marfan syndrome with a history of Bentall-De Bono procedure followed by aortic arch and infrarenal aortoiliac replacements who strongly refused conventional open repair and underwent abdominal debranching followed by thoracoabdominal endovascular stent grafting for the treatment of thoracoabdominal aneurysm."
