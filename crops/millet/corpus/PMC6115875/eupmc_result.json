    "Magnaporthe oryzae is a filamentous fungus, which causes significant destruction to cereal crops worldwide. To infect plant cells, the fungus develops specialised constricted structures such as the penetration peg and the invasive hyphal peg. Live-cell imaging of M. oryzae during plant infection reveals that nuclear migration occurs during intermediate mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope neither completely disassembles nor remains entirely intact. Remarkably, in M. oryzae, mitotic nuclei show incredible malleability while undergoing confined migration through the constricted penetration and invasive hyphal pegs. Here, we review early events in plant infection, discuss intermediate mitosis, and summarise current knowledge of intermediate mitotic nuclear migration in M. oryzae."
