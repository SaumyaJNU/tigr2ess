    "Objective To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of Zelesse®, an intimate hygiene wash solution, in the relief of the symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis in paediatric patients. Methods The NINESSE Study was a prospective, observational, multicentre study involving females aged 2-8 years who attended paediatric offices with symptoms suggestive of non-specific vulvovaginitis. They were administered Zelesse® as a single treatment for 15 ± 5 days. Pruritus, burning, dysuria, erythema, leucorrhoea and oedema were evaluated before and after treatment. Results A total of 71 paediatric patients were enrolled in the study (mean ± SD age, 4.5 ± 1.9 years). The most significant effects were observed for pruritus and burning, where 98.4% (62 of 63) and 96.9% (63 of 65) of the patients improved after treatment, respectively. Zelesse® demonstrated a beneficial effect on dysuria, erythema, leucorrhoea and oedema. The effects on the symptoms and signs were observed within the first week of treatment; although 44.9% (31 of 69) of patients experienced improvements after 2-3 days. Zelesse® was well accepted and tolerated by most patients. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions Zelesse® was very effective for the relief of the symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis, in particular pruritus, burning and erythema, in females aged 2-8 years."
