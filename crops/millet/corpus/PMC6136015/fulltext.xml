Interestingly, a high percentage of non-specific vulvovaginitis cases are recurrent.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The diagnosis is clinical and is mainly based on an adequate anamnesis and
physical examination.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Factors associated with the risk of vulvovaginitis include a hypoestrogenized
vaginal mucosa, lack of development of the labia minora, close proximity of the
vagina to the anus, poor hygiene, tight-fitting clothing or the use of shampoos or
soaps.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Some hygienic sanitary
measures are fundamental in the management of non-specific vulvovaginitis, such as
avoiding wet clothing (in contact with the genital area) for long periods and
avoiding the use of tight-fitting and synthetic clothing.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> While the use of cotton underwear and adequate cleansing of the body with
warm water and soap, excluding the genital area, are recommended.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Symptoms of non-specific vulvovaginitis can also be adequately controlled
with the use of topical products.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In this context, Zelesse&#x000ae; (ITF Research Pharma S.L.U., Madrid, Spain) is an
intimate hygiene wash solution based on chamomile, burdock and aloe vera, marketed
since 2013,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> which is beneficial for the management of non-specific vulvovaginitis in
adult women. An observational multicentre clinical study of 50 adult women with
non-specific vulvovaginitis (or presumably with no infectious origin) who used
Zelesse&#x000ae; once or twice daily for 15 days demonstrated that all symptoms and signs
associated with vulvovaginitis improved significantly after treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A total of 93% of women showed improvement in pruritus, 87% in oedema, 77% in
leucorrhoea and 68% in erythema.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Pruritus, leucorrhoea and erythema were cured in 53%, 42% and 44% of women, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Moreover, 82% of women considered the tolerability of the product to be very
good or excellent; and highlighted its soothing and refreshing properties.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Improvement of symptoms and signs after the treatment with Zelesse&#x000ae; was also
demonstrated in the study, which included 50 women with symptoms of non-specific
vulvovaginitis and 87 women with vulvovaginal infection.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Among women with non-specific

1.9 to 0.5 after the treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Zelesse&#x000ae; also improved erythema, oedema and vaginal discharge.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Similarly, Zelesse&#x000ae; decreased the Global Symptoms and Signs (GSS) score of

the absence of investigations of Zelesse&#x000ae; in children, this present study aimed to
investigate the use of Zelesse&#x000ae; in a cohort of female patients aged between 2 and 8
years. The main objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability

vulvovaginitis in paediatric patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-0300060518775566"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec3-0300060518775566"><title>Study design</title><p>The NINESSE Study was a prospective, observational, descriptive, multicentre
study involving female paediatric patients aged 2 to 8 years attending a
paediatric office with symptoms and signs suggestive of non-specific
vulvovaginitis and whose paediatrician considered that hygienic measures could
be beneficial for their condition. The inclusion of the patients was consecutive
upon their arrival to the paediatric office. The clinical study was performed
between March 2016 and May 2016. The study was carried out in 13 private and
public paediatric centres located in Madrid, Barcelona, Ourense, Pontevedra and
A Coru&#x000f1;a. Exclusion criteria were: (i) vulvovaginitis with specific aetiology,
such as caused by pathogens, congenital abnormalities and traumas; (ii) any
disorder or characteristic in girls that, according to the investigator&#x02019;s
opinion, could interfere with the study results; (iii) having experienced the
menarche; (iv) hypersensitivity to any component of Zelesse&#x000ae;; (v) concomitant
participation in another clinical study. All patients received treatment with
Zelesse&#x000ae; for 15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5 days in a dose of 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;ml, once, once or twice (as needed),
or twice daily according to investigator&#x02019;s decision. The study required two
visits to the paediatrician: one at baseline and another one after
treatment.</p><p>All procedures were undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario
Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. All parents or legal guardians
signed the written informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-0300060518775566"><title>Endpoints and variables</title><p>The study endpoints were designed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and
acceptability of Zelesse&#x000ae; in this population of paediatric patients with
non-specific vulvovaginitis. Efficacy was determined by evaluating the
following: (i) the prevalence and intensity of symptoms (pruritus, burning and
dysuria) and signs (erythema, leucorrhoea and oedema), and the evolution of
symptoms and signs and intensities over time; (ii) the paediatrician&#x02019;s
subjective opinion on the contribution of Zelesse&#x000ae; to the resolution of the
symptoms and signs; (iii) the parent&#x02019;s subjective perception of improvement;
(iv) the time to improvement; (v) the incidence of adverse events; (vi) the
compliance with treatment. The prevalence and intensity of symptoms and signs
were individually evaluated at baseline and after treatment. Intensities were
graded as 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;absence, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild intensity, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate intensity and 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe
intensity. The evolution of symptoms and signs over time was determined by
comparing their intensities at baseline and at the end of the treatment and was
categorized into four groups according to the outcome: cured (absence of the
symptom/sign observed at baseline), improvement (decreased intensity of the
symptom/sign observed at baseline), no change (same intensity at the end of the
treatment as at baseline) and worsening (increased intensity of the symptom/sign
observed at baseline). The GSS score,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> a composite score of
symptoms and signs (ranging between 0 and 18), was calculated by summing the
individual intensities for each symptom and sign both at baseline and after
treatment with Zelesse&#x000ae;. After treatment, paediatricians were asked about the
contribution of Zelesse&#x000ae; to the resolution of the symptoms and signs (&#x02018;great
contribution&#x02019;, &#x02018;some contribution&#x02019;, &#x02018;slight contribution&#x02019; or &#x02018;no contribution&#x02019;);
and parents or legal guardians were asked about their perception about the
improvement of the symptoms and signs (&#x02018;total recovery&#x02019;, &#x02018;great improvement&#x02019;,
&#x02018;discreet improvement&#x02019; or &#x02018;no changes&#x02019;). When girls showed improvement, parents
or legal guardians also reported the time to improvement: &#x02018;2&#x02013;3 days after
starting the treatment&#x02019;, &#x02018;within the first week of treatment&#x02019;, &#x02018;after the first
week of treatment&#x02019; or &#x02018;at the end of the second week&#x02019;. Tolerability was
determined by the incidence of adverse events and the opinion of parents on this
regard at the end of the treatment period. Parents or legal guardians evaluated
the tolerability of the treatment by using an ad-hoc 5-point scale: &#x02018;very well
tolerated&#x02019;, &#x02018;well tolerated&#x02019;, &#x02018;fairly well tolerated&#x02019;, &#x02018;poorly tolerated&#x02019; or
&#x02018;very poorly tolerated&#x02019;. Acceptability was also evaluated by the opinion of the
parents or legal guardians by using an ad-hoc 5-point scale: &#x02018;very well
accepted&#x02019;, &#x02018;well accepted&#x02019;, &#x02018;fairly well accepted&#x02019;, &#x02018;poorly accepted&#x02019; or &#x02018;very
poorly accepted&#x02019;). The treatment was considered very poorly accepted when girls
refused to use the vaginal wash or cried during administration.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-0300060518775566"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Considering previous studies of Zelesse&#x000ae; involving adult female patients with

their most typical manifestations.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> To date, there are no
published studies that have evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability
of Zelesse&#x000ae; in paediatric patients. Results from the present study demonstrated that
Zelesse&#x000ae; produced a significant improvement in the prevalence and intensity of the
symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis in paediatric patients aged 2 to 8
years. Indeed, after receiving Zelesse&#x000ae; every symptom and sign diminished in the
great majority of patients: approximately nine out of 10 patients presenting with
any symptom or sign were cured (with the exception of erythema, which was cured in
76.8%) and two out of three symptomatic girls were cured (i.e. absence of all
symptoms and signs).</p><p>Pruritus, burning and erythema are the most prevalent manifestations of non-specific
vulvovaginitis reported in clinical practice and in the published
literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Studies
analysing the efficacy of topical products on symptoms and signs of non-specific
vulvovaginitis are limited, especially in young girls. A prospective study involving
42 girls aged between 10 months and 12 years with symptoms and signs of
vulvovaginitis such as pruritus (81%), leucorrhoea (50%) and erythema (71%), who
received a soap-free cleansing solution for intimate hygiene once or twice daily for
at least 1 week, demonstrated that symptoms and signs were improved after treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In this current study, the majority of significant manifestations of
vulvovaginitis were improved or cured: pruritus in 98%, burning in 97%, dysuria in
100%, erythema in 93%, leucorrhoea in 95% and oedema in 98% of the patients that
presented with the signs and symptoms at baseline. The improvement in pruritus and
burning was considered clinically relevant as they are very distressing and
persistent, and frequently they do not resolve without treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>In this present study, Zelesse&#x000ae; was particularly effective against pruritus, which
represents the most bothersome symptom and the most common reason why patients
consult the doctor.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Pruritus causes discomfort and anxiety in girls, especially at night.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Nocturnal pruritus can impair the sleep and the quality of life of girls and
their parents.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> It is particularly important that pruritis is adequately managed in
paediatric patients because secondary bacterial and fungal infections might appear
as a result of scratching with poorly washed hands.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the present study, pruritus
improved and disappeared in 98% and 89% of the patients that presented with this
symptom at baseline, respectively. In terms of intensity, 100% of the patients with
moderate/severe pruritus at baseline presented with absence/mild pruritus after
treatment. A very good response was also shown in leucorrhoea, a sign more frequent
in older girls that appears as a consequence of the inflammatory response in the
genital area.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In this present study, leucorrhoea was reported by 52% of girls at baseline
and only remained in two of 37 patients (5.4%) after treatment. Erythema was the
sign that showed the least pronounced improvement after treatment in the present
study. At baseline, 97% of patients presented with erythema of various intensities
and after treatment 23% still presented with this sign. Normally, erythema
represents the most resistant sign and takes longer to disappear than the other
typical manifestations.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In addition, this fact might be explained by the difficulty associated with
evaluating the evolution of this sign in girls aged between 2 and 8 years. Erythema
is frequently accompanied by local swelling, which can cause discomfort in contact
with clothes or while performing activities such as walking or running. Normally,
this swelling is not treated with concomitant medication. In terms of intensity,
erythema decreased from 1.7 to 0.2, which represents a significant variation. These
patients often develop non-specific erythema of mild intensity (most of the time it
causes no pain) since this sign is associated with dentition and the use of
diapers.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that Zelesse&#x000ae; showed a great improvement in the
evolution of all of the evaluated symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis
in paediatric patients. In fact, more than 92% of girls with moderate or severe
symptoms or signs diminished the intensity to mild or absence after the treatment
and the GSS score showed that intensity was reduced from 7.4 to 0.5 after the
treatment.</p><p>In this current study, 59.2% of patients had history of at least one previous episode
of vulvovaginitis. This prevalence of recurrence was in concordance with
investigator&#x02019;s clinical practice and the published literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Girls mainly
attend the doctor due to the irritation of the genital area and this is rarely due
to a lack of hygiene. Hygienic sanitary measures appear to be associated with the
socioeconomic level of the patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Patients from this present study were derived mainly from private
paediatrician offices, which suggests a medium-to-high socioeconomic level. This
fact was in accordance with the hygienic sanitary measures reported at baseline,
i.e. washing the intimate area frequently with soap (57.7%), ensuring to dry the
area after a bath (77.5%), wearing cotton clothing (95.8%) and avoiding
tight-fitting clothing (91.5%).</p><p>The present study demonstrated that the effects of Zelesse&#x000ae; on the symptoms and signs
of non-specific vulvovaginitis were rapidly observed; in 44.9% of cases the
improvement was shown after 2&#x02013;3 days and most responses were observed within the
first week of treatment. Both paediatricians and parents agreed in terms of their
opinion that Zelesse&#x000ae; greatly contributed to the resolution/total recovery of the
symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis. Furthermore, it was well accepted
and tolerated by most of the paediatric patients. Indeed, only four patients (5.6%)
reported an adverse event during treatment and none of them were considered
serious.</p><p>This present study had several limitations. First, the study did not include a
control or placebo group for comparison purposes, especially for the evaluation of
efficacy. However, it was not considered fully necessary for this preliminary study,
which is the first investigation performed in paediatric patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0300060518775566" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Secondly, the
study design was limited because there were only two visits for clinical evaluation
(baseline and after the treatment). More time points would increase the knowledge
about the evolution of the symptoms and signs of vulvovaginitis during the treatment
period. In our opinion, the design of the present study was useful as it allowed for
the preliminary investigation of the efficacy of Zelesse&#x000ae; for the management of
non-specific vulvovaginitis in paediatric females. Further studies, involving larger
cohorts of patients, with more follow-up time points and with control groups, would
be required to corroborate these initial findings.</p><p>In conclusion, Zelesse&#x000ae; is an intimate hygiene wash solution, which was very
effective for the relief of the symptoms and signs of non-specific vulvovaginitis in
females aged between 2 and 8 years. Zelesse&#x000ae; was particularly effective against
pruritus, burning and erythema, which are the most prevalent and intense problems
observed in young females with non-specific vulvovaginitis. These three symptoms and
signs are usually persistent and hard to resolve without adequate management.
Improvements were observed quickly and Zelesse&#x000ae; was well accepted, well tolerated
and very few adverse events were reported.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Additional participants in the NINESSE study were as follows: M. J. de Ibarrondo, MD,
