To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identify single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with seedling heat tolerance, a genome-wide association mapping study (GWAS) was conducted using 200 diverse representative lines of the hard red winter wheat association mapping panel, which was established by the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TCAP) and genotyped with the wheat iSelect 90K SNP array. The plants were initially planted under optimal temperature conditions in two growth chambers. At the three-leaf stage, one chamber was set to 40/35&#x000b0;C day/night as heat stress treatment, while the other chamber was kept at optimal temperature (25/20&#x000b0;C day/night) as control for 14 days. Data were collected on leaf chlorophyll content, shoot length, number of leaves per seedling, and seedling recovery after removal of heat stress treatment. Phenotypic variability for seedling heat tolerance among wheat lines was observed in this study. Using the mixed linear model (MLM), we detected multiple significant QTLs for seedling heat tolerance on different chromosomes. Some of the QTLs were detected on chromosomes that were previously reported to harbor QTLs for heat tolerance during the flowering stage of wheat. These results suggest that some heat tolerance QTLs are effective from the seedling to reproductive stages in wheat. However, new QTLs that have never been reported at the reproductive stage were found responding to seedling heat stress in the present study. Candidate gene analysis revealed high sequence similarities of some significant loci with candidate genes involved in plant stress responses including heat, drought, and salt stress. This study provides valuable information about the genetic basis of seedling heat tolerance in wheat. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GWAS to map QTLs associated with seedling heat tolerance targeting early planting of dual-purpose winter wheat. The SNP markers identified in this study will be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of seedling heat tolerance during dual-purpose wheat breeding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>seedling stress</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="2"/><ref-count count="65"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most important feed and food crops in the world and it covers more cultivable land globally than any other crop. Moreover, it provides food for 36% of the world&#x02019;s population (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cossani and Reynolds, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Prerna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Anderson, 2015</xref>). In the southern Great Plains of the United States, including Oklahoma and Texas, dual-purpose wheat grown for cool season grazing is seeded at least 2&#x02013;3 weeks earlier than wheat grown for grain only to increase fall to winter forage production. However, early planting in the fall often coincides with high temperatures that affect seed germination, seedling growth, and development, eventually resulting in reduced forage and grain yield. As the global climate continues to change, the severity and frequency of high temperature stress is likely to increase, thereby resulting in reduction of productivity of important crops including wheat. Climate predictions show that, by the end of the 21st century, the average global temperature is expected to increase by 1&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Driedonks et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, development of dual-purpose wheat cultivars with tolerance to heat stress during the seedling stage is crucial for early planting in the region.</p><p>Several studies have outlined the effects of heat stress on plant morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes at various growth stages of wheat (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cossani and Reynolds, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paliwal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>). The effects of heat stress during the seedling stage include reduction of photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, respiration rate, and death of the seedlings due to excessive dehydration of leaves beyond the permanent wilting point (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ristic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cossani and Reynolds, 2012</xref>). Research findings in the past indicated that heat stress causes swelling of the thylakoid membrane and malfunction of photosystem II involved in photosynthetic activity (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ristic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>). Chlorophyll is harbored in the thylakoid membrane and when this membrane is damaged by the stress, chlorophyll content is reduced (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ristic et al., 2008</xref>). However, phenotypic variability for heat tolerance among genotypes has been studied during the reproductive stage but limited information is available for the seedling stage.</p><p>High temperature stress at the grain filling stage has been reported to reduce the yield and quality of wheat (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wardlaw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Schapendonk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Stratonovitch and Semenov, 2015</xref>), sorghum [<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench] (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2008</xref>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Heat stress has been found to reduce wheat yield by 33.6% and by more than 50% (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chatrath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>). The yield potential of wheat is rarely attained, particularly when moderate heat stress occurs and alternates with periodic extreme heat stress (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2011</xref>). Heat tolerance is a polygenic trait that is controlled by many genes with minor effects on the phenotype. Therefore, selection of heat stress tolerance under field conditions is very challenging because of its genetic complexity, weather variability and the influence of genotype-by-environment interaction effect. In this regard, identification of QTLs and molecular markers associated with tolerance to heat stress is crucial for improving breeding efficiency using marker-assisted selection (MAS).</p><p>To date, dissection of QTLs for heat tolerance in wheat has been mainly conducted during the grain filling stage using bi-parental mapping populations (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>). These studies identified various major and minor QTLs for vegetative and reproductive stage traits on different wheat chromosomes. For example, five QTLs for heat tolerance in wheat were detected on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2B, 6A, and 7A (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, two QTLs for heat tolerance have been detected on chromosomes 2B and 5B in a spring wheat mapping population (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Butler, 2002</xref>). Again in other studies, QTLs for heat tolerance during the grain filling stage have been found on several chromosomal regions including 1A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 5A, and 6D (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, QTLs associated with yield components and physiological traits, such as stay green and senescence of wheat, were found on chromosomes 2A, 3A, 4A, 6A, 6B, and 7A (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, using a meta-analysis strategy, major QTLs associated with heat tolerance were detected on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 2D, 4A, 4D, 5A, and 7A (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Acu&#x000f1;a-Galindo et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, another significant locus on chromosome 3B, associated with the heat susceptibility index of yield components, was identified using a bi-parental mapping population (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2010</xref>). Although linkage mapping using bi-parental mapping populations has successfully identified heat tolerance QTLs, it requires a large amount of resources and time to develop mapping populations such as recombinant inbred lines (RILs). In addition, it relies on recent recombination resulting in low mapping resolution and only alleles differing in the parents are considered with this approach. On the other hand, with GWAS, diverse individuals are used without developing new mapping populations, making it less expensive. Historic recombination events existing in the population are leveraged in GWAS, thereby resulting in high mapping resolution compared with linkage mapping. However, GWAS requires higher marker density than traditional QTL mapping because linkage disequilibrium (LD) is in general much lower in a GWAS population than in a bi-parental population.</p><p>The GWAS approach has been used to discover genes controlling both polygenic and monogenic traits. For example, QTLs associated with important traits such as disease resistance (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tadesse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arruda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), yield, and grain quality traits (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Tadesse et al., 2015</xref>) in wheat have been discovered with GWAS. QTLs associated with heat tolerance in wheat have also been detected using GWAS (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mondal et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although heat tolerance during the reproductive stage of wheat has been well characterized, heat stress during the seedling stage is not studied. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (1) to map QTLs associated with seedling heat tolerance in wheat and (2) to identify SNP markers for MAS of seedling heat tolerance during dual-purpose wheat breeding in the southern Great Plains of the United States.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Genetic Materials and Phenotyping</title><p>A set of 200 lines, selected based on genetic diversities from a hard red winter wheat association mapping panel consisting of 299 wheat lines from the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TCAP<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>), was used in this study. The association mapping panel is composed of representative winter wheat lines across the Great Plains (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Grogan et al., 2016</xref>). The experiments were conducted in two growth chambers. A high-temperature treatment (40/35&#x000b0;C day/night) to mimic heat stress was induced at the three-leaf stage for 14 days in one chamber, and an optimal-temperature treatment (25/20&#x000b0;C day/night) was used as a control in the other chamber. Photoperiod and light intensity in both growth chambers were set at 16 h and 400 &#x003bc;ml m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The plants were planted in 72-well flat trays in a randomized complete block design with three biological replicates of each line. The trays were randomly arranged and periodically moved around to avoid positional effect. Throughout the experimentation, plants were watered as needed in both growth chambers to ensure no drought stress.</p><p>Data were collected on leaf chlorophyll content, shoot length, number of leaves per seedling, and seedling recovery. Leaf chlorophyll content was measured using a self-calibrating SPAD chlorophyll meter (Model 502, Spectrum Technologies, Plainfield, IL, United States). Three measurements of leaf chlorophyll content were taken per line, and the average was used for statistical analysis. Shoot length was measured from the soil surface to the tip of the longest leaf. Leaf chlorophyll content and shoot length were measured 10 days after heat stress treatment. Number of leaves per seedling was recorded as the average number of leaves counted from three seedlings, 14 days after the seedlings were exposed to heat stress. Seedling recovery was the percentage of seedlings that were able to recover 7 days after removal of heat stress treatment. Heat stress response, referred to as trait relative difference (TRD), was calculated as the difference between trait performance at optimal and high temperatures, and then divided by performance at optimal temperature. The experiment was repeated six times (i.e., six runs) using the same two chambers.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypic Data Analysis</title><p>Analysis of variance of the phenotypic data was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software V9.3 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">SAS Institute, 2011</xref>) to assess the effects of genotype, run, and genotype-by-run interaction. All sources of variation were considered as random effects. All other variances besides genotype and experimental run were pooled as residuals.</p></sec><sec><title>SNP Genotyping</title><p>The wheat lines were genotyped using the wheat iSelect 90K SNP genotyping array (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Guttieri et al., 2017</xref>), which generated 21,555 SNPs. After SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 5% and missing data of more than 10% were filtered out, a total of 15,574 SNPs remained and were used for analysis. The genetic positions of the SNP markers used in this study were based on the consensus map developed using eight wheat mapping populations (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Population Structure, Kinship, and Linkage Disequilibrium Analyses</title><p>The genetic structure of the panel was assessed using the STRUCTURE program, principal component analysis (PCA), and neighbor-joining (NJ) tree analysis. The STRUCTURE program version 2.3.4 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Falush et al., 2003</xref>) was used to estimate the number of groups (<italic>K</italic>) and the membership coefficients. A model-based Bayesian clustering approach was performed, where the number of assumed groups was set from <italic>k</italic> = 1 to 10. During STRUCTURE analysis, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) of 15,000 burn-in replicates followed by 15,000 iterations was run and repeated five times using an admixture model. Due to lots of admixtures in the panel, the STRUCTURE results were verified by comparing the results to other analyses. The optimal number of groups in this panel was determined based on the point where the posterior probability [LnP(D)] began to plateau from the STRUCTURE analysis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Casa et al., 2008</xref>) and the NJ tree analysis. The principal components (PCs) were calculated using the R function <italic>princomp</italic>, while the NJ tree analysis was performed in TASSEL version 5.2.28 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bradbury et al., 2007</xref>). To determine the number of PCs to use in clustering and GWAS analysis, a scree plot was generated by plotting the percentage of variances explained by the first 10 PCs against the number of PCs. Based on this, the optimal number of PCs (where the &#x0201c;<italic>elbow</italic>&#x0201d; point occurred) was selected. The analysis of K between lines was performed following the identity-by-state method (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Endelman and Jannink, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Linkage disequilibrium among pairs of SNP markers was performed with the TASSEL software using 3,484 tag SNPs selected using the R package SNPRelate (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, 2013</xref>). LD for within and across the three wheat genomes (A, B, and D) was estimated as a squared allele frequency correlation (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic>) between SNP marker pairs. All SNP marker pairs with <italic>p</italic>-values of less than 0.001 were considered to be in significant LD. LD decay distance was estimated by plotting the scatterplot of LD <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> values between marker pairs and the genetic distance (in cM) using the R package SNPRelate (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, 2013</xref>), while the trend line was fitted by second-degree LOESS (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Cleveland, 1979</xref>). To determine whether significant SNP markers associated with the trait on each chromosome were in LD with the highest -log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic>-value) SNP hit, LD analysis was performed on every chromosome where significant QTLs were detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome-Wide Association Mapping Analysis</title><p>Genome-wide association mapping was performed with the Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lipka et al., 2012</xref>). For the Q model, three PCs that were selected based on scree plot generated from PCA were included in the model as fixed-effect covariate (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>) to correct for population structure. In the K model, the K matrix between individuals was calculated and included in the model as random-effect covariate.

Significant QTLs were initially tested based on a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 following a step-wise procedure (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>), which is very stringent (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 2011</xref>). However, a lower threshold, unadjusted significance <italic>p-</italic>value &#x0003c;0.001, was eventually used to declare significance since the FDR is too stringent in the current study.

Frequency distribution of the lines for the investigated traits at optimal and heat-stressed growth conditions are presented in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>. Mean leaf chlorophyll content at optimal temperature was 38.3 with a range from 31.8 to 44.9, while for heat-stressed plants, mean leaf chlorophyll content was 26.7, ranging from 17.0 to 37.1. At optimal temperature, mean shoot length was 44.9 cm, ranging from 35.0 to 56.5 cm, whereas at heat-stressed growth condition, the mean value was 33.8 cm, and the range was from 23.5 to 44.4 cm. Mean number of leaves per seedling was six at optimal temperature compared with four at heat-stressed growth condition. For the number of leaves per seedling, phenotypic variation among lines was very small as shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold> because almost all plants were at three-leaf stage when the experiment started. As a result, variation in number of leaves per seedling among lines was very small by the end of 14-day temperature treatment. As for seedling recovery, on average, 52.3% of seedlings were able to recover after the removal of heat stress treatment (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>).

PCA divided the panel into four main groups with lots of admixture (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). However, the PCA revealed that the population structure in this panel is very low since the first three PCs collectively explained only about 19.4% of the total variance.

According to the NJ tree analysis, this panel can also be divided into four major groups (G1, G2, G3, and G4), based mainly on geographic origins and pedigree information (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S1A</xref></bold>). For example, in the first main group (G1), majority of the lines were from the Oklahoma State University and the Texas A&#x00026;M University. Most lines with a common parent in their pedigree tended to cluster into the same group. For example, the majority of the lines assigned to G1 had &#x0201c;Jagger&#x0201d; as one of the parents in their pedigree. The largest number of lines forming G2 originated from the University of Nebraska breeding program, followed by the Kansas State University and the Colorado State University. Group G3 was dominated by wheat lines from the AgriPro Syngenta followed by those from the University of Nebraska wheat breeding program.

On chromosome 4B, the QTL (<italic>QSLHS.nri-4B</italic>) was mapped at genetic position ranging from 57 to 60 cM. This QTL explained 12.8% of the phenotypic variation in shoot length. The QTL (<italic>QSLHS.nri-7B</italic>) on chromosome 7B was represented by two SNPs and mapped within 54&#x02013;58 cM. Together, the two SNP markers explained 10% of the phenotypic variation in shoot length at heat-stressed growth condition. The most significant markers were the same markers that were detected at optimal growth condition, located on chromosomes 4B and 7B, indicating that the detected shoot length QTLs are expressed under both optimum and heat-stressed growth conditions, thus they are not necessarily related to heat stress.</p><p>For heat response of shoot length, three QTLs were detected on chromosomes 3B and 7D (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">S2</xref></bold>).

The third most significant SNP was mapped at 68 cM on chromosome 4B, which accounted for 7.4% of phenotypic variation.</p><p>At heat-stressed growth condition, four QTLs significantly associated with number of leaves per seedling were detected (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">S2</xref></bold>). The first QTL (<italic>QLNHS.nri-1B</italic>) was mapped at 112 cM on chromosome 3A, and explained about 6.2% of the phenotypic variation.

The two markers mapped at 78 cM together explained 15.2% of the phenotypic variation, while the marker located at 150 cM accounted for 8.3% of the phenotypic variation in heat stress response of number of leaves per seedling. Overall, the data suggest that heat stress or heat response QTLs associated with the number of leaves per seedling are located on chromosomes 2A, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5A, 5B, and 7B according to QTLs detected for heat stress response of the trait, or by comparing the QTLs detected under heat-stressed vs. the optimum condition (<bold>Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref></bold>).</p><p>For seedling recovery after removal of heat stress treatment, six QTLs were detected on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 7A, and 7B, and these were represented by 16 SNPs (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">S2</xref></bold>). The phenotypic variation explained by these SNPs varied from 6.5 to 8.5%. On chromosome 2A, one QTL (<italic>QSLHS.nri-2A</italic>) was located at genetic position of 96 cM. This QTL was represented by five SNPs, which collectively explained 33% of the phenotypic variation in seedling recovery after heat stress.

Another QTL (<italic>QSLHS.nri-2D</italic>) was found on chromosome 2D at the genetic distance of 26 cM, and it was represented by three SNP markers, which together explained 18.6% of the phenotypic variation. On chromosome 3A, one QTL (<italic>QSLHS.nri-3A</italic>) was detected and mapped at 123&#x02013;129 cM. The QTL on 3A explained 12.4% of the phenotypic variation in seedling recovery after removal of heat stress treatment.

In the Southern Plains of the United States including Oklahoma and Texas where livestock and forage production are the largest contributors to agricultural income, winter wheat is often used for cool season grazing, which needs early planting for increased fall to winter forage production. Winter wheat under a dual-purpose management system could be planted as early as the end of August, when the temperature is often still very high for the crop to establish. Therefore, improving seedling heat tolerance for winter wheat grown for forage and grain production will have a huge economic impact in the region. We conducted a GWAS to map QTLs and identify SNP markers associated with seedling heat tolerance for MAS of seedling heat tolerance during wheat breeding. Identification of QTLs associated with seedling heat tolerance will facilitate the introgression of heat tolerance alleles into elite wheat cultivars through MAS.</p><p>In the present study, the association mapping panel showed significant phenotypic variation in leaf chlorophyll content, shoot length, number of leaves per seedling at optimal and high temperature regimes, and seedling recovery after removal of heat stress treatment. In addition, variation in heat stress response, i.e., relative performance difference between the two temperatures, for all traits was also observed. These results suggest that there is a great potential that these lines can be used to mine alleles for seedling heat tolerance for introgression into elite winter wheat lines for seedling heat tolerance improvement.</p><p>Population structure and familial relatedness can result in false positives in GWAS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Crossa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Matthies et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, when GWAS is conducted, these parameters need to be considered in the model. In the present study, the level of genetic structure of the panel was assessed by the PCA, NJ tree, and STRUCTURE analyses. Results from the three clustering methods showed that this panel is structured into four major groups. Our results agree with previous GWAS done using winter wheat lines selected from the same hard red winter wheat association mapping panel (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ayana, 2017</xref>). In their study, they used 294 lines of the association mapping panel to molecular characterize spot blotch and bacterial leaf streak resistance in bread wheat, and the STRUCTURE analysis revealed four major groups existing in this panel, although admixtures were also observed. In the present study, the stratification was mainly based on geographical regions and pedigree relation. Genetic structuring of winter wheat lines along geographic regions has also been previously reported (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we observed that some lines with common parents in their pedigrees tended to cluster in the same subgroup within the main group. For instance, some lines with &#x0201c;Jagger&#x0201d; wheat line as one of the parents in their pedigrees formed one subgroup. This result corroborates the GWAS of powdery mildew disease using a different set of winter wheat lines, in which the authors found that the lines were structured along pedigree information (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, they found that 13 accessions with the common parent, &#x0201c;Jagger&#x0201d; in their pedigrees clustered in one group. However, in general, we observed that the level of genetic stratification was low, as revealed by the modest contribution of the three PCs (19.4%) to the total genetic variance. This reduced and loose population stratification is because of historical admixture resulting from sharing genetic materials among different wheat breeding programs in the hard red winter wheat region of the United States.</p><p>Linkage disequilibrium is one of the most important factors in association mapping studies because it determines the power of association between QTLs and phenotype. In this study, we estimated the LD decay distances of the three wheat genomes including A, B, and D genomes. Our results suggest that D genome had the highest LD decay distance (10.9 cM) compared to A (9.7 cM) and B (9.8 cM) genomes. As only 200 representative lines were selected from the original panel in the current study, the LD distances are changed compared to a previous study involving the same panel (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ayana, 2017</xref>). In general, our results corroborate previous studies done in wheat (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ayana, 2017</xref>). However, other studies have reported much higher LD than estimated in our study when using different ecotype wheat lines. For example, LD decay distance of 23 cM in European hexaploid wheat lines has been reported (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, three statistical models were compared to assess their ability to map QTLs and identify SNPs associated with seedling heat tolerance. We decided to do this because previous studies have shown that the best model can vary depending on the trait (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gurung et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we selected the MLM, which accounts for both population structure (PCs) and K matrix, because of its statistical power to control false positives. To the best of our knowledge, rare QTL studies have been done for heat tolerance during the seedling stage of wheat. However, there have been a lot of QTLs studies in heat tolerance during the flowering stage or grain filling stage of wheat. For example, QTLs for heat tolerance during the grain filling stage of wheat have been reported (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in other cereal crops such as sorghum (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chopra et al., 2017</xref>) and rice (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lafarge et al., 2017</xref>), QTL studies for heat tolerance have been conducted. The focus of previous studies was either on the vegetative stage or the flowering stage because heat stress during the flowering stage has been one of the most important limiting factors contributing to yield losses in many crop species. However, heat stress during the seedling stage of winter wheat has been a common issue in the southern Great Plains of the United States due to early planting, particularly in a dual-purpose management system, in which case the crop is planted very early in the fall. Therefore, this study was primarily conducted to unravel QTLs or genes associated with seedling heat tolerance in winter wheat purposely grown for forage as well as grain production.</p><p>Using the MLM, we identified multiple significant QTLs for wheat seedling traits at optimum and heat-stressed growth conditions. QTLs associated with seedling heat stress or heat response were found by comparing the QTLs detected under heat-stressed vs. the optimum condition, or mapping heat response QTLs using the relative phenotypic trait difference between the two growth conditions. QTLs associated with leaf chlorophyll content at heat-stressed growth condition but not at optimum temperature were found on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 4A, and 4B, while QTLs for heat stress response of the trait were detected on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 4A, 4B, and 5B (<bold>Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref></bold>). We believe that these are the true chromosomes that harbor leaf chlorophyll content QTLs responding to heat stress since they were only detected under heat stressed temperature and/or mapped using heat response of the trait. Previous studies also identified QTLs for heat stress tolerance traits, specifically at grain filling stage of wheat on chromosomes 2B, 2D, and 4A (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paliwal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Acu&#x000f1;a-Galindo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bhusal et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous QTL studies conducted in wheat also identified QTLs for leaf chlorophyll content under heat stress on other chromosomes including 1B, 1D, 6A, and 7A (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>), which were not detected at the seedling stage in the current study. Moreover, in another QTL study, leaf chlorophyll content QTLs under heat stress mapped on chromosomes 1A and 6B were reported (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Tahmasebi et al., 2016</xref>). Again, these QTLs were not detected in the present study. However, the QTL for heat-stress response of the leaf chlorophyll content detected on 5B was not reported in other studies mentioned above. Although QTLs detected at optimal temperature are not related to heat stress, interestingly in this study one SNP marker (IWB14950) on 1B, which associated with leaf chlorophyll content at optimal growth condition, has high sequence similarity with kDa class VI heat shock protein, known to be involved in heat stress tolerance. However, this SNP marker was not detected at heat-stressed growth condition as well as heat stress response.</p><p>We also conducted BLAST search on NCBI to unravel candidate genes using sequences of the SNPs detected in the present study (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">S2</xref></bold>). The results showed that some of the significant SNP markers have high sequence similarities with candidate genes, known to be involved in plant stress responses in different crops including wheat. For example, on chromosome 2D, the significant SNP IWB28728 for leaf chlorophyll content responding to heat stress has 89% sequence similarity with putative plastid-lipid-associated protein 13. The putative plastid lipid-associated protein 13 has been reported to play an important role in improving plant performance under stress conditions. In addition, it actively participates in thylakoid function from biogenesis to senescence, suggesting that it is a precursor of the chloroplast thylakoid membranes (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Rottet et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, on chromosome 4B, significant SNP IWB42264 for leaf chlorophyll content at heat-stressed growth condition and heat response of the trait, has 94% sequence similarity with K (+) efflux antiporter 5 isoform X1, which contains potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), a major osmoticum of plant cells. The accumulation of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) in the plant vacuole is important for plants under high-salt stressed conditions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Assaha et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the significant SNP IWB18745 for heat stress response of leaf chlorophyll content on chromosome 2D has 97% sequence similarity with IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like, which is able to hydrolyze certain amino acid conjugates of the plant growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">LeClere et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, on chromosome 2D, the heat responding SNP IWB4541 has a DNA sequence with 100% similarity to that of the heat shock N-terminal domain-containing protein found in maize, which is essentially involved in plant responses to various environmental stress including heat.</p><p>For shoot length, the same significant QTLs were detected at both optimal and heat-stressed growth conditions. Generally, QTLs associated with a trait under optimal conditions usually controls the trait under stressed-conditions (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Mathews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mwadzingeni et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, this scenario was observed for shoot length QTLs on chromosomes 4B and 7B indicating that the detected QTLs were associated with shoot length itself as a plant architecture trait, and not related with heat stress tolerance <italic>per se</italic>. These results suggest that the effects of these QTLs are not influenced by temperature changes. Therefore, such kind of QTLs may be useful in marker-assisted breeding (MAB) of crops with broad environmental adaptation. On the other hand, shoot length QTLs were detected for heat response on 3B and 7D, which were also reported previously to harbor QTLs for heat tolerance traits at vegetative and grain filling stages of wheat (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paliwal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although some of the markers associated with shoot length were significant at both growth conditions, BLAST search revealed that some of the identified SNPs have high sequence similarities with candidate genes known for plant stress response. For example, the DNA sequence of SNP IWB35611 on chromosome 4B has high sequence similarity with serine/threonine protein kinase STE 20-like, which has been reported to play an important role in salt tolerance in plants (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2011</xref>). Another SNP IWB12856 on chromosome 4B has high sequence similarity with inositol-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase 3, transcript variant X1, which has been reported to confer plant stress tolerance (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The two SNP markers on 4B were located 2.45 cM apart from each other. In addition, the SNP marker IWB1428 on 3B, which was found to be significantly associated with heat stress response of shoot length, showed 83% sequence similarity with G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinase. Research done in the past showed that the G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinase acts as a positive regulator of plant tolerance to salt stress (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, for the number of leaves per seedling and seedling recovery, some of the QTLs detected in this study were located in the same chromosomes that were reported in other heat stress studies at various adult plant stages (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Vijayalakshmi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paliwal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Talukder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Acu&#x000f1;a-Galindo et al., 2015</xref>). However, BLAST search against sequences of SNPs associated with the number of leaves per seedling and seedling recovery did not reveal any candidate genes that are known responding to abiotic stress.</p><p>In summary, some QTLs for seedling heat tolerance-related traits identified in this study were found on the same chromosomes previously reported to harbor QTLs for heat tolerance, although the growth stages reported in the previous studies are different from the growth stage investigated in the present study. Our results suggest that some of heat tolerance QTLs detected during the seedling and the flowering stages of wheat may be co-localized. In addition, other QTLs identified in the seedling stage in the present study have not been reported in those studies conducted at the flowering time or grain filling stages. Moreover, BLAST search using DNA sequences of some of the significant loci found in this study revealed candidate genes known to be involved in plant stress responses in wheat and other crop species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GWAS to map QTLs and identify SNP markers significantly associated with seedling heat tolerance-related traits targeting early planting of dual-purpose winter wheat. Significant SNP markers identified in this study will be used for MAS of seedling heat tolerance to facilitate selection of the trait during wheat breeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>FM phenotyped the association mapping panel, analyzed both phenotypic and genotypic data, and drafted the manuscript.
