<article-title>It starts at the ends: The zebrafish meiotic bouquet is where it all begins</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>Meiosis is a cellular program that generates haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. While chromosome events that contribute to reducing ploidy (homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination) are well conserved, their execution varies across species and even between sexes of the same species. The telomere bouquet is a conserved feature of meiosis that was first described nearly a century ago, yet its role is still debated. Here we took advantage of the prominent telomere bouquet in zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, and super-resolution microscopy to show that axis morphogenesis, synapsis, and the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) all take place within the immediate vicinity of telomeres. We established a coherent timeline of events and tested the dependence of each event on the formation of Spo11-induced DSBs. First, we found that the axis protein Sycp3 loads adjacent to telomeres and extends inward, suggesting a specific feature common to all telomeres seeds the development of the axis. Second, we found that newly formed axes near telomeres engage in presynaptic co-alignment by a mechanism that depends on DSBs, even when stable juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes at interstitial regions is not yet evident. Third, we were surprised to discover that ~30% of telomeres in early prophase I engage in associations between two or more chromosome ends and these interactions decrease in later stages. Finally, while pairing and synapsis were disrupted in both <italic>spo11</italic> males and females, their reproductive phenotypes were starkly different; <italic>spo11</italic> mutant males failed to produce sperm while females produced offspring with severe developmental defects. Our results support zebrafish as an important vertebrate model for meiosis with implications for differences in fertility and genetically derived birth defects in males and females.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Inherent to reproduction is the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next. In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes an equal amount of genetic information, packaged in chromosomes, to the offspring. Diploid organisms, like humans, have two copies of every chromosome, while their haploid gametes (e.g. eggs and sperm) have only one. This reduction in ploidy depends on the segregation of chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in gametes with one copy of each chromosome. Missegregation of the chromosomes in the parents leads to abnormal chromosome numbers in the offspring, which is usually lethal or has detrimental developmental effects. While it has been known for over a century that homologous chromosomes pair and recombine to facilitate proper segregation, how homologs find their partners has remained elusive. A structure that has been central to the discussion of homolog pairing is the bouquet, or the dynamic clustering of telomeres during early stages of meiosis. Here we use zebrafish to show that the telomere bouquet is the site where key events leading to homologous chromosome pairing are coordinated. Furthermore, we show that deletion of <italic>spo11</italic>, a gene required for proper recombination in most studied organisms, resulted in very different effects in males and females where males were sterile while females produced deformed progeny.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM075119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0511-0084</contrib-id><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Sean M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided from NIH (NIH.gov) award number R01 GM 079115 to SMB and a UC Davis Faculty Research Grant to SMB and BWD.

Typically, homologous chromosomes (homologs) separate during meiosis I, and sister chromatids separate at meiosis II. Errors at either stage can lead to the production of aneuploid gametes, which is a major contributor to miscarriage and birth defects in humans [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During meiosis I prophase, homologs undergo pairing and crossing over, which is essential for their proper segregation in nearly every organism studied to date [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Crossovers are created through a process termed recombination, where programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired using the homolog as a template, resulting in the exchange of homologous chromosome arms [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Meiotic DSBs are formed by Spo11, a conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They are then processed to reveal 3&#x02019; single stranded stretches of DNA that bind the strand exchange proteins, Dmc1 and Rad51, and engage in homology search [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In meiosis, the repair template is preferentially skewed towards the homologous chromosome rather than the sister chromatid, thus facilitating the pairing process [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While hundreds of DSBs might form in a single meiotic cell, only a subset go on to form crossovers, with the others being repaired via a noncrossover pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>DSB formation and crossing over occur in the context of the chromosome axis, a proteinaceous structure to which a linear array of chromosome loops is attached; both sister chromatids of a homolog are attached to a single axis and held together by cohesins [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In many organisms, including mouse, budding yeast, and several plants, recombination initiation and repair intermediates are necessary for formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a tripartite proteinaceous structure that forms between the two homolog axes and holds them together along their lengths [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>](<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007730.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, DSBs are dispensable for SC formation (synapsis) in some organisms such as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, synapsis is initiated at &#x0201c;pairing centers&#x0201d; and ensues without the need for recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In most organisms studied to date, recombination and the SC are used to link the homologous chromosomes.

In mouse males, while synapsis initiates interstitially as well as near the telomeres, there is a skew toward initiation at chromosome ends [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By contrast, synapsis in mouse and human females initiates primarily in interstitial regions [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while synapsis in female cattle initiates both near telomere ends and interstitially [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In many organisms, SC is nucleated preferentially at crossover fated sites [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Correspondingly, in mouse, human, and cattle, there is a skew toward crossovers in the distal regions of chromosomes in males but not in females [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>During meiosis, telomeres are tethered to the nuclear envelope and their movement is directed by cellular cytoskeleton components [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One type of motion that is prominent in many species is the movement of chromosomes into and out of the bouquet, a conserved arrangement of chromosomes where telomeres are clustered together to one side of the nucleus. The bouquet has been hypothesized to restrict the chromosomes to one region of the nucleus thereby facilitating homolog recognition and pairing, possibly by limiting the homology search area or by active chromosome motion to disrupt weak non-specific interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, in some organisms the bouquet does not exist (e.g. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>) or does not form until after homologs are already co-aligned (budding yeast, <italic>Sordaria</italic>, mouse, and some plants) [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], in which case it may play additional roles such as removing interlocks that form between two synapsed chromosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that telomeres can form end-to-end associations in mammalian spermatids [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] as well as in somatic and pachytene cells of some plants such as the dandelion-like smooth hawksbeard, <italic>Crepis capillaris</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], pachytene cells of the cricket, <italic>Gryllus argentinus</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and human spermatocytes [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The number and timing of these associations during meiotic prophase is poorly understood.</p><p>Our understanding of meiosis has been facilitated by the breadth of model organisms that have been studied, with each contributing new insight into the process.

Indeed, the analysis of species-specific features has greatly informed our understanding of the seemingly fluid relationships between double-strand breaks (DSBs), the telomere bouquet, homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination over evolutionary time scales [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There are remarkable similarities relating pairing, synapsis and recombination across phyla, even though difference in genome sizes can vary by orders of magnitude, especially when comparing mouse and humans to yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Understanding how the chromosome events of meiosis are accommodated by larger genomes (and vice versa) necessitates the inclusion of additional model genetic organisms.</p><p>Zebrafish has many advantages as a vertebrate model for meiosis. Zebrafish can produce hundreds of offspring from a single cross, and external development allows for early detection of developmental abnormalities, including those caused by aneuploidy [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

In addition, transparent gonads allow for observation of multiple stages of meiosis in a whole mount. Several cytological studies have provided insights into some aspects of zebrafish meiosis. For example, it has been shown in males that DSBs and the initial loading of the chromosome axis protein, Sycp3, and the SC transverse filament protein, Sycp1, are polarized to one side of the nucleus near the bouquet [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mlh1 foci, indicating sites of crossovers, have been shown to be distally skewed in males but not females [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These data are consistent with the genetic map where recombination is skewed to the telomeres in males yet more evenly distributed in females [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A major gap of knowledge is that the order of events and the relationship between chromosome structure and recombination are not known. For example, it is not known if Spo11, a protein required for the formation of meiotic DSBs, is necessary for synapsis and homolog pairing in the zebrafish. This is an important relationship to determine as it sets the stage for further analyses of chromosome dynamics.</p><p>In this study we set out to establish the relationship between DSBs, synapsis initiation, and the establishment of close, stable homolog juxtaposition (which we refer to here as pairing) in the zebrafish males and females. We analyzed the progression of chromosome synapsis and pairing, telomere interactions, and double strand break localization at the super-resolution level. We created a knockout mutation in the <italic>spo11</italic> gene and found that both pairing and synapsis in the zebrafish are Spo11-dependent. We found dramatic sex-specific outcomes from disrupting Spo11: although synapsis and pairing defects were similar between <italic>spo11</italic> mutant males and females, males were completely sterile while females were able to produce offspring, though with severe developmental defects. Our results establish zebrafish as a tractable vertebrate model for understanding the chromosome events of meiosis I prophase from an evolutionary vantage and opening new lines of research with implications for human fertility and genetically derived birth defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sycp3 loading and synapsis are temporally and spatially coupled events in zebrafish spermatocytes</title><p>To better understand the relationship between the bouquet, Sycp3 loading, and synapsis in zebrafish, we set out to find when and where these events occur relative to one another in the prophase I nucleus.

We assessed the extent of these associations by counting the total number of engaged telomere ends, defined by an Sycp3 line and its telomere associating with another end. One association could involve two or more engaged telomere ends. For a detailed description of our criteria see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">methods</xref>. We observed the highest numbers of associations at the L to L/EZ stages, with an average of ~ 31% of telomeres engaged in associations with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The associations subsequently decreased to an average of ~ 6% but were still detected throughout the later stages including pachytene. In some cases, a short stretch of Sycp3 could be seen bridging the telomeres of unrelated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels 5G and 6G). The nature of these bridges is not known, however, Sycp3 protein can both bind dsDNA and form self-assemblies which are consistent with what we see [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Associations involving more than two chromosomes indicated that at least a subset of telomere associations occurred between nonhomologous chromosomes or at the opposite end of the same chromosome. This was especially evident at the zygotene stage where telomeres of synapsing chromosomes were seen forming associations with a non-partner telomere, and at the pre-pachytene and pachytene stages where telomeres of synapsed chromosomes associated with nonhomologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panel 6G). Our data suggest that telomere associations are a normal part of zebrafish meiosis I and not a pathological occurrence such as fusions caused by nonhomologous end-joining.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Presynaptic co-alignment of homologous chromosomes occurs near the telomeres</title><p>In nearly every organism studied to date, axes of homologous chromosomes undergo some degree of co-alignment, or pairing, prior to synapsis, in which the distance between co-aligned axes is typically about 0.4 &#x003bc;m [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

We inspected images of spermatocyte nuclear spreads for evidence of axis co-alignment in the absence of detectable SC, marked by Sycp1. A detailed description of co-alignment assessment is provided in the methods. In brief, chromosome regions were considered co-aligned when Sycp3 lines were closely juxtaposed with the narrowest region between them at a distance of &#x0003c; 0.5 &#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Panels 1F and 2F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We found that presynaptic co-alignment of chromosomes occurred near the telomeres and adopted two main types of configurations: funnel and pinch. In the funnel configuration, co-alignment occurred directly adjacent to the telomeres to form the stem of the funnel while the other ends of the Sycp3 lines diverged away from the stem. The diverging lines could either be long or short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels 1F and 2F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), cross each other, or even fold backward toward the stem. In the pinch configuration, the narrowest region between the Sycp3 lines did not occur directly adjacent to the telomere, but a short distance away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p><p>We found a total of 23 funnel configurations and 10 pinch configurations among 24 wild-type spermatocyte cells from the L to the MZ/LZ stage. During leptotene, co-alignments were rare, indicating that chromosomes were not stably juxtaposed with their partners at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We found the highest number of co-alignments during the L/EZ and EZ/MZ stages, when the chromosomes begin to actively engage with each other to initiate synapsis. By the MZ/LZ and LZ stages, we found almost no co-alignments since most or all of the chromosomes had already engaged in telomere proximal synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). As individual nuclei with presynaptic co-alignment usually have less than a total of five co-alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), we believe that this is a transient stage mediated by homologous recombination that quickly progresses to synapsis initiation for any given chromosome pair. The funnel and pinch configurations likely represent recombination events that initiate very close to the telomere or slightly inward. It is likely that the pinch and funnel axis shapes are precursors to synapsis initiation since we saw similar configurations with short stretches of SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels 2E and 2F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Moreover, unpaired telomeres in the pinch configurations suggest that stable telomere associations are not the primary driver of homolog pairing and that initial homology recognition can occur in sub-telomeric regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Co-alignment at interstitial loci is coincident with synapsis</title><p>While we observed pre-synaptic co-alignment near the telomeres, we found no evidence for similar co-alignment at interstitial regions of the axes. For chromosomes where synapsis had initiated, the distances between the diverging edges of the two Sycp3 lines were often much greater than 0.4 &#x003bc;m and were frequently bent in non-parallel orientations with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels 2E, 3E, 3F, 5F, 3G, 4G). This suggested that axes were not stably co-aligned at interstitial regions prior to synapsis. To determine when interstitial sites become stably co-aligned relative to SC formation, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on cells at different stages of meiotic prophase I using a 68 kilobase bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe located ~10 Mb from the end of chromosome V (total 72.5 Mb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007730.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

In the zebrafish spermatocytes, we regularly found chromosomes that were intertwined or sometimes trapped between another set of homologs at the pre-pachytene stages when most of the chromosomes were already synapsed (i.e. 16&#x02013;24 fully synapsed chromosomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These configurations closely approximated interlock structures seen at late zygotene in other species [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Interlocks occur when one chromosome or a pair of chromosomes becomes entrapped between the space of two synapsing homologs. Thus, from a first approximation, the structures we see are likely interlocks. Interestingly, nuclei at this stage frequently also had individual pairs of chromosomes with extensive or complete de-synapsis, sometimes with another homolog appearing to be entrapped in the desynapsed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g005">Fig 5</xref>, Panels 1A-1C, 2A-3D, 5A-6D). Of 8 cells at this pre-pachytene stage, only 2 showed no anomalies. Of the remaining cells, 3 had both interlocks and de-synapsis, 1 had just an interlock, and 2 had just de-synapsis. The de-synapsis is unlikely to be due to the cells transitioning to diplotene, as some de-synapsed chromosomes were completely separated with no evident crossover connections, and some were entangled around other chromosomes. Although interlocks are not a common feature of pachytene cells, it is also possible that there is a subset of cells where interlocks persist through pachytene and the chromosome-wide de-synapsis we see are chromosomes in diplotene. Interestingly though, we never saw a spread nucleus showing a classic diplotene state as seen in other organisms where a complete set of de-synapsed bivalents were held together by one or more chiasmata, suggesting this state in males is transient or full-length Sycp3 axes start to degrade at this stage.</p><fig id="pgen.1007730.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1007730.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Interlocks and de-synapsed chromosomes in male zebrafish meiosis I.</title><p>1A-6C: Examples of nuclear surface spreads showing interlocks (arrows) and de-synapsed chromosomes (triple arrows) at the late zygotene to pachytene stage where most chromosomes are synapsed.

Consistent with this finding, and with the &#x003b3;H2AX localization, we found that Rad51 foci were interspersed with the telomere foci in the bouquet cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). If DSBs are required for initiating synapsis, then we expected to find that most SC stretches would be associated with a Rad51 focus. This was not the case, however, since there were many instances of SC stretches with no associated Rad51 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, panels 1C-3C). We found that 39% (n = 269) of synapsed ends in early zygotene had no associated Rad51 focus. This was surprising given that we also found that synapsis requires Spo11-dependent DSBs (below). Three possible reasons could account for this observation: 1) some synapsis may occur independent of DSBs, 2) synapsis is initiated at Rad51-associated DSBs but Rad51 signal has been lost due to repair prior to imaging, or 3) some synapsis is initiated at Dmc1-associated DSBs that do not co-localize with the Rad51-associated DSBs. The latter is supported by data from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> where Dmc1 and Rad51 DSBs do not colocalize [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>We found that some cells at pachytene had Rad51 foci and they were located both near the telomeres and in interstitial regions.

Further studies are required to distinguish between these models.

Unlike in wild type, the telomere associations were maintained at high levels in the mutant throughout prophase I. Several possibilities could account for the loss of telomere associations in wild-type cells. Pairing and synapsis between the ends of homologous chromosomes could physically displace weak associations between non-related chromosome ends. Alternatively, a regulatory feature associated with the transition from leptotene to zygotene could signal loss of a subset of associations, or the reduction of entanglements later in meiosis could allow associations to be disrupted by the physical force of spreading. Any one of these possibilities could account for the persistence of associations in the <italic>spo11</italic> mutant.</p><p>Wild-type cells that were in the EZ/MZ to LZ stages gave a distribution of inter-BAC distances that were overall shorter than those in the L or L/EZ stage (0.24&#x02013;3.13 &#x003bc;m vs. 9.3&#x02013;25.3 &#x003bc;m, p = 0.0004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007730.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).

Moreover, the focus of these events was specifically limited to the ends of chromosomes. From a first approximation, the general lack of close, stable homolog juxtaposition at interstitial sites suggests that the two ends of the same chromosome are not distinguished as such. Since zebrafish have 25 pairs of chromosomes, any given end is thus challenged to find its homologous partner among 99 possible choices within the bouquet prior to zygotene. Processes that promote the efficiency of pairing could include time intervals that favor collisions by diffusion [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], rapid prophase movement to increase the rate of collisions via attachment of telomeres to cytoskeletal motor proteins outside the nucleus [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and/or through one or more DSB-independent pairing interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>For organisms that initiate synapsis at sites of DSBs, homolog juxtaposition along the lengths of chromosomes can often be detected prior to synapsis (e.g. <italic>Sordaria</italic>)[<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, in these organisms a dramatic polarization of DSBs toward the telomere region, like that seen in zebrafish, is not evident. By contrast, DSBs and synapsis initiation in human males and the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> show a polarization similar to zebrafish [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In the planarian, synapsis was shown to drive homolog pairing. It is possible that zebrafish homologs are paired by synapsis as well. A notable difference between the planarian and zebrafish, however, is that the planarian does not require Spo11 for synapsis whereas the zebrafish does, suggesting distinct SC nucleation methods between the two species. Our study does not answer the question of whether interstitial regions are physically juxtaposed by &#x0201c;zippering up&#x0201d; as SC spreads, or if a wave of DSBs creates new synapsis initiation sites and/or stabilizes SC.</p><p>Interestingly, in zebrafish, the bouquet is also the organizing center of the Balbiani body (Bb), a collection of embryonic patterning factors, mitochondria, and organelles which defines the animal-vegetal axis of the oocyte and is found in a wide variety of organisms including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and mouse [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

First, nonhomologous telomere associations were prominent throughout meiosis, yet the nature of these associations is not well understood. One possibility is that they represent associations between heterochromatic regions like those seen in crickets [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], or telomere-bound protein interactions, as has been proposed for Trf1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We also do not know if they represent interactions between the same chromosomes from cell to cell. Associations could represent an early phase of the pairing process where the bouquet facilitates interactions between all telomeres, and rapid chromosome movements act to disrupt weak nonhomologous interactions to favor stronger DSB-dependent homologous interactions [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, it is unknown what structure at or near the telomere seeds the initial loading of Sycp3, or the significance of the Sycp3 &#x0201c;bridges&#x0201d; sometimes seen between nonhomologous telomeres.</p><p>Second, our results show that Spo11 is required for the co-alignment of axes and SC formation. We attribute this effect to the formation of DSBs by Spo11 since the earliest occurrences of Rad51 and &#x003b3;H2AX signals are skewed toward telomeres where co-alignment and SC first appear. Observing Rad51 foci and &#x003b3;H2AX staining first near telomeres and later at interstitial locations suggests that DSBs may form in a wave, where initial breaks near telomeres bring homologs together to initiate local synapsis, while subsequent breaks form as Sycp3 is progressively loaded to initiate and/or to stabilize SC elongation. Consistent with the latter model, we occasionally see more than one synapsis initiation site between two chromosomes, albeit close to the telomere. A previous study showed that RPA foci, known to mark intermediates of DNA replication and DSB repair, form lines along the elongating axis in the zebrafish [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is not known, however, if these are a result of DNA replication or Spo11-dependent recombination intermediates. Another possibility is that one or a few DSBs near the telomere are sufficient to promote synapsis along the length of a chromosome. The kinetic relationship between Sycp3 loading and Spo11-dependent SC initiation and elongation points to a possible regulatory mechanism that couples these processes. A study in the medaka fish, <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>, has shown that loading of Sycp3 and Sycp1 is polarized to one side of the leptotene nucleus, with Sycp3 lines appearing to slightly anticipate Sycp1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This suggests that the mechanism of Sycp3 loading and synapsis in zebrafish may be common to other fishes.</p><p>Third, a transient interlock stage suggests a robust resolution mechanism. Interestingly, in cells where interlocks are observed, we also see pairs of chromosomes separated by long stretches of de-synapsed regions, sometimes disjoining two chromosomes completely. One possibility is that zebrafish employ long-range chromosome de-synapsis to resolve chromosome interlocks, as has previously been suggested in other organisms [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is possible that late-forming interstitial DSBs may play a role in re-establishing homologous synapsis at pachytene following this method of interlock resolution.

Zebrafish has previously been proposed as a model for germ cell aneuploidy [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. We show here that despite exhibiting similar defects in synapsis and pairing, <italic>spo11</italic> mutant males and females show vastly different outcomes in reproduction. The males are unable to produce sperm, while females produce eggs that result in severely deformed offspring. This is in line with previous studies that show sexually dimorphic outcomes: Disruptions of Mlh1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and Mps1, a kinase required for the spindle assembly checkpoint [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], show a tendency for females to produce aneuploid offspring. Unlike in <italic>spo11</italic> mutants, where males are sterile, and <italic>mlh1</italic> mutants, where males are predominantly sterile, both male and female <italic>mps1</italic> mutants produce aneuploid offspring, although the rate is higher in females than males (~46% vs. ~26% respectively). This suggests complex mechanisms underlying causes of increased aneuploidy in zebrafish females.</p><p>Sex specific differences are also seen in <italic>spo11</italic> mutant mice; spermatocytes die by early pachytene whereas oocytes survive until diplotene/dictyate stage [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The arrest seen in mouse males, however, is likely different than the arrest seen in zebrafish. Among organisms with heterogametic sex determination, mechanisms have evolved to specifically accommodate unpaired chromosomes in the heterogametic sex, including meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. As such, mutations that disrupt pairing might be expected to have a weaker effect in the homogametic sex, where the MSCI checkpoint may not be as robust [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In domesticated zebrafish, sex determination is polygenic, with no universal structural differences between chromosome sets of sexes in lab strains [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, we did not observe any chromosomal regions that remained unpaired during pachytene. Thus, the pronounced effect of the <italic>spo11</italic> mutation in males is likely not due to the activation of the MSCI checkpoint. Instead, the failure to produce sperm may depend on another checkpoint, such as the synapsis or the spindle assembly checkpoints, that operate in other model systems [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Zebrafish as a model for human reproduction</title><p>Our findings highlight the importance of studying multiple model systems. While homolog pairing and recombination are considered universal features of meiosis, the means to getting there is quite varied among species. Interestingly, some meiotic prophase events in zebrafish resemble the corresponding events in human spermatogenesis, including the tendency of DSBs to skew near the ends of chromosomes and the initiation of synapsis at telomeres followed by inward synaptic progression [<xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007730.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].

At this point, 10 &#x003bc;l of the BAC probe (1:19 dilution in LSI buffer) was added per slide, covered with a 24 x 50 coverslip, and sealed with rubber cement (Elmer&#x02019;s, Atlanta, GA, Catalog# E904). The slides were heated in a hybridization oven at ~70&#x02013;71&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes and then the oven temperature was allowed to drop to ~50&#x000b0;C after which the slides were transferred to a flat, humid chamber and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C overnight in the dark. The coverslip was peeled off and the slides were washed in coplin jars in 1) 50% formamide in 2X SSC at 45&#x000b0;C, 2 times for 5 minutes each, 2) 2X SSC at 45&#x000b0;C, 2 times for 5 minutes each, 3) 4X SSC + 0.05% Tween 20 for 8 minutes, 4) 1:1 2X SSC:PBSTw (1X PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature (RT) for 5 minutes, and 5) PBSTw at RT, 3 times for 5 minutes. Excess PBSTw was removed from the slides by tapping their sides on a paper towel. The antibody staining and slide mounting were performed as described in the &#x0201c;Primary antibody staining&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Secondary antibody staining&#x0201d; sections, with PBSTw used instead of PBT.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Chromosome spreads measurements</title><sec id="sec034"><title>Synaptonemal complex/ staging</title><p>Sycp3 lines were measured from the telomere to the end of the Sycp3 stained region using the segment tool of ImageJ.
