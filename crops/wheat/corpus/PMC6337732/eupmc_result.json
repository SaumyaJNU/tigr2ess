    "The EXO70 gene family is involved in different biological processes in plants, ranging from plant polar growth to plant immunity. To date, analysis of the EXO70 gene family has been limited in Triticeae species, e.g., hexaploidy Triticum aestivum and its ancestral/related species. By in silico analysis of multiple Triticeae sequence databases, a total of 200 EXO70 members were identified. By homologue cloning approaches, 15 full-length cDNA of EXO70s were cloned from diploid Haynaldia villosa. Phylogenetic relationship analysis of 215 EXO70 members classified them into three groups (EXO70.1, EXO70.2, and EXO70.3) and nine subgroups (EXO70A to EXO70I). The distribution of most EXO70 genes among different species/sub-genomes were collinear, implying their orthologous relationship. The EXO70A subgroup has the most introns (at least five introns), while the remaining seven subgroups have only one intron on average. The expression profiling of EXO70 genes from wheat revealed that 40 wheat EXO70 genes were expressed in at least one tissue (leaf, stem, or root), of which 25 wheat EXO70 genes were in response to at least one biotic stress (stripe rust or powdery mildew) or abiotic stress (drought or heat). Subcellular localization analysis showed that ten EXO70-V proteins had distinct plasma membrane localization, EXO70I1-V showed a distinctive spotted pattern on the membrane. The 15 EXO70-V genes were differentially expressed in three tissue. Apart from EXO70D2-V, the remaining EXO70-V genes were in response to at least one stress (flg22, chitin, powdery mildew, drought, NaCl, heat, or cold) or phytohormones (salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethephon, or abscisic acid) and hydrogen peroxide treatments. This research provides a genome-wide glimpse of the Triticeae EXO70 gene family and those up- or downregulated genes require further validation of their biological roles in response to biotic/abiotic stresses."
