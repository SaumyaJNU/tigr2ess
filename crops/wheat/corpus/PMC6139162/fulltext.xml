The stress imposed on plants by combined alkalinity-salinity is distinct from that imposed by salinity in a neutral soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Elucidating the molecular basis of the plant response to saline/alkaline conditions could accelerate the breeding of crop varieties better able to tolerate these stresses. Much research effort has been expended on understanding the response to simple salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With respect to alkalinity tolerance, apart from some evidence that the PKS5 mediated pathway is significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the level of understanding of the response to this stress remains rather rudimentary.</p><p id="Par17">Single-stranded RNA molecules ranging in length between 20&#x000a0;nt and 24&#x000a0;nt are referred to as microRNAs (miRNAs). Their biological significance lies in the observation that they negatively regulate up to 30% of eukaryotic genes, either through their guiding the cleavage of a complementary mRNA or via their inhibition of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This mode of regulation acts in plants to modulate both development and the response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As an example, the abundance of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> miRNA miR393 responds to changes in the severity of a range of stress agents, including soil salinity, moisture deficiency and low temperature; its target is a component of the auxin signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, the abundance of miR398 is modulated by the oxidation status of plant tissue, thereby affecting the activity of target genes which encode scavengers of superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Wheat is one of the most important cereal in the world; its grain is processed into a large range of products which are consumed by at least 40% of the world&#x02019;s population. The wheat plant is rather sensitive to both salinity and alkalinity, but conventional selection among the derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybrid formed between the bread wheat cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and tall wheatgrass (<italic>Thinopyrum ponticum</italic>) has succeeded in identifying the two breeder&#x02019;s lines Shanrong No. 3 and No. 4 (SR3 and SR4), with the former being more tolerant of salinity than JN177 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the latter more tolerant of alkalinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While SR3 out-performs SR4 in a neutral saline soil, the reverse is the case in an alkaline pH saline soil. Here, the focus was on their responses to both stresses, in particular through an analysis of miRNA expression. The analysis, based on miRNA and degradome sequencing, was able to identify a number of target genes, and has provided some insights into the ways in which the SR lines achieve their superior stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Responses of wheat to salinity and alkalinity stress</title><p id="Par19">When two-leaf-stage seedlings of JN177, SR3, and SR4 were exposed to either 200&#x000a0;mM NaCl or 100&#x000a0;mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/NaHCO<sub>3</sub> for seven days, both SR lines tolerated more effectively than did JN177 to both stresses; moreover, SR3 exhibited a higher tolerance of salinity than SR4, while SR4 showed more tolerant to alkalinity than SR3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> A,B). The same behavior was apparent when tolerance was assessed in terms of the electrical conductivity of the leaf (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The three lines were subsequently grown under irrigation with either fresh water, saline water (0.4% NaCl) or alkaline water (60&#x000a0;mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/NaHCO<sub>3</sub>); the soil pH in the three containers was, respectively 7.5&#x02013;8.0, 7.8&#x02013;8.3 and 9.3&#x02013;9.8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). SR3 and SR4 plants both yielded better than JN177 plants in the presence of either stress, but SR3 out-yielded SR4 in the saline conditions and vice versa in the alkaline ones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) of the three wheat lines were also measured.

After removal of low quality sequences, adapters and polyA/T/G/C sequences, each library yielded 12&#x02013;22 million reads (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of these between 5 and 13 million were in the size class 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;nt. The most abundant size was 24&#x000a0;nt in each case (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). When the sequences were aligned with wheat unigene and wheat genomic sequence using the BLAST algorithm, 50&#x02013;70% of them perfectly matched to wheat genome which were mostly &#x0201c;+&#x0201d;Mapped sRNA (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The aligned sequences were then categorized by reference to the Rfam database (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3), which allowed for the removal of rRNA, tRNA, snRNA and snoRNA sequences; the remaining reads were then used to query the set of wheat miRNAs assembled in miRBase release 21 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">www.mirbase.org</ext-link>), applying a strict alignment criterion (zero mismatches). This process yielded a set of 85 already documented miRNAs (&#x0201c;known&#x0201d; miRNAs), 49 of which were associated with 27 families (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S1, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2). The remaining reads were analyzed using miREvo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and mirdeep2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] software: this analysis identified 219 of them as bona fide miRNAs (&#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; miRNAs) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3). The stem-loop secondary structure of ten novel miRNAs is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Aligning the latter sequences with miRNAs documented in other species (the alignment criterion was relaxed to allow for up to two mismatches) resulted in the recognition of 35 sequences which were homologous with 24 non-wheat miRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S4). About one half of these miRNAs were relatively abundant (mean abundance of &#x0003e;&#x02009;10 across the nine libraries) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S5). There was a pronounced bias in both the known and novel miRNAs for A as the mature sequence&#x02019;s first base (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S4). Many of the mature sequences generated from the set of known miRNAs featured a G in the middle and a C at their 3&#x02032; end (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S5). On the basis of an evolution conservative analysis, 43 families were identified, among which 23 families were represented in several plant species, while the other 20 families were represented solely in wheat or in a small number of wheat-related species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of sRNA in nine small RNA libraries</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Total_reads</th><th>Clean reads</th><th>Total sRNA</th><th>Mapped sRNA</th><th>&#x0201c;+&#x0201d;Mapped sRNA</th><th>&#x0201c;-&#x0201d;Mapped sRNA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>JNC</td><td>13905227</td><td>13622140</td><td>8570198</td><td>5815655 (67.86%)</td><td>5572036</td><td>243619</td></tr><tr><td>SR4C</td><td>23460206</td><td>22745078</td><td>13442946</td><td>9491485 (70.61%)</td><td>9083128</td><td>408357</td></tr><tr><td>SR3C</td><td>13957096</td><td>13189289</td><td>6137061</td><td>3083944 (50.25%)</td><td>2863890</td><td>220054</td></tr><tr><td>JNS</td><td>12620549</td><td>12028013</td><td>5683955</td><td>3109524 (54.71%)</td><td>2905578</td><td>203946</td></tr><tr><td>SR4S</td><td>12666276</td><td>12051099</td><td>5002942</td><td>2804316 (56.05%)</td><td>2627315</td><td>177001</td></tr><tr><td>SR3S</td><td>19071353</td><td>18115112</td><td>6947715</td><td>3928870 (56.55%)</td><td>3682891</td><td>245979</td></tr><tr><td>JNA</td><td>15807924</td><td>15080336</td><td>7467791</td><td>3783971 (50.67%)</td><td>3541206</td><td>242765</td></tr><tr><td>SR4A</td><td>14615338</td><td>13555241</td><td>5385320</td><td>2770732 (51.45%)</td><td>2601734</td><td>168998</td></tr><tr><td>SR3A</td><td>14899916</td><td>14142849</td><td>6718130</td><td>3350157 (49.87%)</td><td>3162281</td><td>187876</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Note: &#x0201c;JN&#x0201d; means samples of JN177. &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; in JNC, SR3C, SR4C means control condition, and &#x0201c;S&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; means saline or alkaline treatment, respectively</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Secondary structure prediction of ten novel wheat miRNA precursors.

As a result of the stress treatment, the gene <italic>Taes_1BL_63019C378.1</italic> was up-regulated, while the abundance of its corresponding miRNA novel_84 was decreased. The abundance of a further nine miRNAs was shown as negatively correlated with that of their corresponding target in the contrast SR3/SR4 vs JN177 plants exposed to either salinity or alkalinity. A selection of five of the targets of the stress-induced miRNAs was made for an <italic>in planta</italic> assay in tobacco (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Figure S6).

In every case, the GUS signal strength was reduced when the target gene was co-expressed with its corresponding miRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, b</xref>).

A group of 14 genes was associated with signal transduction and a second group of 28 with transcription regulation (including genes encoding various protein kinase, splicing factors and transcription factors such as MYB, NAC, WRKY and bZIP). One target of novel_367 is a bZIP60-like protein, while bZIP60 was related to ER stress response and associated to salt stress in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. WRKY57 was one target of novel_300, which was reported to play role in regulating drought tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A group of 23 genes encoded metabolic proteins, involving carbohydrate, lipid and phenylpropanoid metabolism. For example, two targets of novel_367, encoding glycosyltransferase and sucrose-phosphate synthase, were key enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism process. A lipid metabolism associated lipid-transfer gene, was a target of novel_190. A fourth group comprised seven genes involved in epigenetic modification, encoding histone variants, histone acetyltransferase and chromatin structure remodeling factors (targets of novel_223, novel_284, novel_53 or novel_190). Two genes associated with auxin synthesis (one encoding an indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase and the other flavin-containing monooxygenase 1) were also identified (Targets of novel_300).

A suppression of ROS production, along with an enhanced ROS scavenging ability allowed SR4 to limit the accumulation of ROS in the presence of alkalinity stress.

A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase AHA2, the activity of which was regulated by PKS5 (a serine/threonine protein kinase) and J3 (a chaperone), could transport proton out of the plasma membrane and thus modulate pH in the rhizosphere directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Meanwhile, V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was also associated with alkalinity response. The transcript levels and activity of V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase were induced by saline-alkali treatments, while overexpression of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase could enhance tolerance of alfalfa to saline-alkali stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was reported to have positive correlation with saline and osmotic tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], as the raised proton gradient by it could promote the sequestration of Na<sup>+</sup> into the vacuole through Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, the mechanism of its function in alkali stress response was still not very clear, except for some items indicated ROS metabolism and proline synthesis might be involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A number of genes encoding proton pumps have been shown to be induced by alkalinity stress, and some of these are more abundantly transcribed in SR4 than in JN177 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Here, the abundance of tae-miR9666b was reduced in alkalinity- stressed SR4 plants. As one of its targets, V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase might be up-regulated and have important function for the alkalinity tolerance of SR4. The implication is that the differential transcription of proton pumps may enable SR4 to tolerate alkalinity stress more effectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">The stress imposed by salinity is distinct from that imposed by alkalinity, although the two stresses frequently occur together. It has been possible to select for an improved response to both stresses among the derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between bread wheat and tall wheatgrass: while SR3 performs better than JN177 in the face of salinity stress, SR4 is superior with respect to alkalinity tolerance. Here, the close genetic relationship between JN177, SR3 and SR4 was exploited to determine the contribution miRNAs make to abiotic stress tolerance. The data imply that auxin signaling and epigenetic regulation are both important for the expression of both tolerances; meanwhile JA signaling and carbohydrate metabolism may be more important for salinity tolerance, and proton pumping is vital for alkalinity tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Plant materials and growing conditions</title><p id="Par36">Both SR3 and SR4 are derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between the bread wheat cultivar JN177 and tall wheatgrass (<italic>Thinopyrum ponticum</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The solution was changed daily. RNA was extracted from snap-frozen roots of seedlings exposed to stress for 24&#x000a0;h. Meanwhile, the seedlings in the stress treatment and control were harvested for the measurement of ROS and leaf electrical conductivity. Each measurement represented the mean of ten seedlings, and each treatment/genotype combination was replicated three times.
