Ninety three days old plants during grain filling stage were subjected to heat stress at an elevated temperature of 37&#x000b0;C and 42&#x000b0;C for different time intervals (30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h). Two subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared with RNA isolated from leaf samples at 37&#x000b0;C and 42&#x000b0;C heat stress. The ESTs obtained were reconfirmed by reverse northern dot blot hybridization. A total of 175 contigs and 403 singlets were obtained from 1728 ESTs by gene ontology analysis. Differential expression under heat stress was validated for a few selected genes (10) by qRT-PCR. A transcript showing homology to <italic>Hsp90</italic> was observed to be upregulated (7.6 fold) under heat stress in cv. C306. CDS of <italic>TaHsp90</italic> (Accession no. MF383197) was isolated from cv. C306 and characterized. Heterologous expression of <italic>TaHsp90</italic> was validated in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 and confirmed by protein gel blot and MALDI-TOF analysis. Computational based analysis was carried out to understand the molecular functioning of TaHsp90.

It provides an excellent source of many essential nutrients particularly vitamins, starch, minerals for 30% of the total world&#x02019;s population [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to climatic models, it is predicted that global temperature will continue to rise in coming years which will adversely affect agricultural production [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In India, Eastern Gangetic plains, Central and Peninsular parts of India are the major wheat growing areas and these are expected to be severely affected by heat stress [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Wheat is highly sensitive to high temperature stress especially at the post anthesis stage (i.e. grain filling) and temperature above the threshold at this stage leads to a drastically reduced yield [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under conditions of high temperature stress, many metabolic and cellular changes take place in plants but the precise mechanism of high temperature stress tolerance is still unclear. Bread wheat cv. C306, a selection from cross between (Regent X Ch23) X C591 (P19 X C28), is a heat and drought tolerant genotype which is usually grown under rainfed conditions [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Limited studies have been carried out to identify the genes associated with heat stress tolerance in cv. C306 [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, wheat cv. C306 is extensively used in breeding program for development of drought tolerant wheat as well as in the identification of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) linked to drought stress tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Bread wheat cv. C306 is a good genomic resource for understanding the molecular basis of heat stress tolerance in wheat. It can also be explored to harness heat stress responsive genes which can be utilized for developing heat stress tolerant wheat using breeding or transgenic approaches. Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) technique is an effective molecular biology tool for identifying differentially expressed genes through subtracted cDNA libraries. It is a low cost alternative to RNA sequencing methods for identifying differentially expressed, novel and/or uncharacterized genes/ESTs, even in organisms where sequence information available is only limited. Though SSH suffers from generation of low data resulting in poor genome coverage, yet it still continues to be one of the most popular technique for generating differentially expressed ESTs in any organism [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Exposure to high temperature activates cellular mechanisms responsible for heat stress, in response to which expression of a number of networking genes like Heat shock proteins (Hsps), molecular chaperones and other genes for interlinked metabolic enzymes are triggered. Chaperones like Hsp60/Hsp10 and Dnaj/Dnak/NEF (Nucleotide Exchange Factor) convert proteins misfolded due to stress to their active conformations whereas Caseinolytic proteases (Clp) play a major role in clearance of protein aggregates. Maize and rice mutants having disrupted ClpB/Hsp100 gene were observed to be susceptible to high temperature stress [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hsp90 and Hsp70 are chaperones that regulate heat stress gene expression by interacting with Hsfs (Heat stress specific transcription factors) [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hsp90 works in coordination with another important co-chaperone called as SGT1 (Suppressor of G2 Allele) by regulating auxin response. The interaction between Hsp90 and SGT1 plays a critical role in abiotic and biotic stress responses [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hsp90 mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were observed to have an abnormal embryo development and seed formation which confirms the crucial role of Hsp90 proteins in embryogenesis. [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HSP90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone primarily involved in protein folding, activation and signal transduction. During initial investigations, these set of proteins were found to be upregulated in cells under stressed conditions, giving the term heat shock protein of 90 kDa. Hsp90 is mainly composed of three conserved domains, N-terminal ATPase domain (ND), middle domain (MD) and C-terminal dimerization domain (CD) [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This study aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes under heat stress conditions in wheat cv. C306 at post anthesis stage by carrying out a detailed transcriptome analysis through SSH technique. Reverse northern dot blot was used to pick up most appropriate heat stress related transcripts prior to sequencing. Few potential heat stress responsive transcripts were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. One of the highly expressed transcript identified in the study, <italic>TaHsp90</italic> (Accession no. MF383197) was isolated and characterized for <italic>In-silico</italic> and computational based analysis to understand its molecular functioning and interaction with other molecules. The gene <italic>TaHsp90</italic> was cloned in prokaryotic expression vector pET28a (+) and was functionally validated in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. The <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells having recombinant plasmid (pET28-<italic>TaHsp90</italic>) was able to provide heat stress tolerance to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells under high temperature conditions. This gene can be validated for heat stress tolerance in a model plant system with an aim to develop transgenic crops for climate resilient agriculture. The heat responsive EST data generated in wheat cv. C306 would open a new avenue to understand molecular basis of stress tolerance in crop plants be and the identified unique transcripts related to heat stress response can be deployed for development of heat stress tolerant transgenics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials, growth conditions and stress treatment</title><p>The seeds of Indian bread wheat cv.

Its analysis under 10 developmental stages of wheat revealed that the highest expression was observed at the dough stage and lowest expression at stem elongation or jointing stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198293.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Level of expression was calculated based on Affymetrix wheat genome array data. It was observed that the expression started decreasing from germination to stem elongation stage and increased till dough stage with a slight fall at flowering stage. It was also observed that expression pattern was similar at seedling and flowering stage (between 9.5 to 10 folds in the medium range category). Similarly, at anatomical level, among the 26 tissues of wheat, highest expression was observed in the endosperm tissue (13 folds) while the lowest expression was observed in the glume (8 folds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198293.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). It was observed that expression was similar in seedling, leaf and crown tissues (10 folds, in the medium range category). Similar expression pattern was also observed in the inflorescence, floret, stamen and anther tissues. Embryo and caryopsis showed almost similar level of expression in the high range category (12&#x02013;12.5 folds). The digital tissue specific expression analysis showed marked differential expression among closely related genes (probesets). Most of the probesets were highly expressed in floret, anther, stamen and endosperm tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198293.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

Considering the importance of wheat-heat interaction, insights are needed into genetic and molecular mechanisms that control stress responsive metabolic pathways in heat tolerant cv. C306.</p><p>Here, we combined SSH, qRT-PCR and reverse northern dot blot analysis to identify the potential genes that are differentially expressed in response to heat stress (HS) with the aim to investigate molecular mechanism underlying for HS tolerance in wheat cv. C306. Secondary amplification of cDNA synthesis was visualized as a smear in the range of 100 bp to 1.5 kb on 1.2% agarose gel which indicated successful library preparation, and this result was in uniformity with Gurjar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For identifying and enriching differentially expressed genes under HS in wheat cv. C306, SSH has been an efficient approach in various crops [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We constructed two HS responsive forward SSH libraries (37&#x000b0;C HS and 42&#x000b0;C HS) at post anthesis stage in heat tolerant bread wheat cv. C306. 1728 EST were assembled to 403 singlets and 175 contigs. This information enriches wheat genome databases and provides basic molecular biology information for gene cloning and analysis of HS responsive metabolic pathways. ESTs obtained in this study showed a clearly defined coupling of plant stress tolerance under HS, which can be further used as HS tolerance linked markers. Under molecular function category the sequences belong to &#x0201c;protein binding and catalytic activity&#x0201d; were found to be most abundant (43 sequences each) under 37&#x000b0;C of HS. These results were in uniformity with that reported by Padaria et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 15.2% contigs and 26.87% singlets did not show any homology, these sequences will add further genomic resource to wheat data base and can be utilized for finding uncharacterized genes/transcription factors etc. These unknown/novel genes or functionally uncharacterized genes would provide a candidate genetic resource for abiotic stress tolerant genes. A chromosome based draft sequence of wheat genome (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese spring) is available, in which 1,24,201 annotated gene loci showed uniform distribution across the subgenomes they have also shown the high sequence similarity of hexaploid wheat to that of diploid and tetraploid ancestors [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is the first study related to HS responsive SSH library preparation of Indian wheat cv. C306 at post anthesis stage and the data has been submitted to EMBL-EBI (Accession no. LT965080 to LT965927: 37&#x000b0;C forward HS library; LT963784 to LT964663: 42&#x000b0;C forward HS library). All the analyzed transcripts have a distinct and important role in activating the tolerance mechanisms under heat and other abiotic stresses. 1728 ESTs were mapped to a total of 55 metabolic pathways (KEGG pathways) which were affected by HS treatment. In this way, an alternative functional annotation to ESTs was provided associated to their biochemical pathway. 11.3% and 30.77% ESTs from 37&#x000b0;C and 42&#x000b0;C HS SSH libraries, respectively, did not show any match to the existing database of NCBI.</p><p>Validation of differential expression of ten selected genes under HS was carried out in heat tolerant (cv. C306) and heat susceptible (cv. HD2967) wheat cultivars. The specificity of qRT-PCR amplification was confirmed by a single peak during melting temperature curve analysis of qRT-PCR amplified products. <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> was used as internal control [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198293.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further, three candidate genes code for <italic>Hsp-Sti</italic>, <italic>Hsp90</italic>, hypothetical <italic>Dnaj</italic> were also studied at different time intervals (30min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h) of HS in tolerant wheat cv. C306, confirming their role in early HS response. Higher level of GPX gene expression in wheat cv. C306 suggests that the potential role of antioxidant machinery for combating HS response. Antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, APX, CAT, GPX works in combination at the time of HS to decrease the level of antioxidants/ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <sup>&#x02022;</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Upregulation of ESTs showing homology to Metallothionenins or MTs was observed to be high confirming their role in HS tolerance. Studies by previous workers have also reported the role of metallothioneins in scavenging ROS [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. PPIase expression was observed to be significantly higher (3.03 folds at 42&#x000b0;C) in wheat cv. C306 as compared to its expression in cv. HD2967 (0.3 folds at 42&#x000b0;C). Enzyme PPIase contains amino acid proline as its main component and it basically functions as a chaperone for proper protein folding under HS, which was in conformity with the findings of Goswami et al. (2016) [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Kurek et al., 1999 have reported that the expression of FKBP77 (encoding PPIase) in wheat cv. Atir was 14 folds higher under HS at 37&#x000b0;C, which defined it as heat stress dependent isoform [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Hsp-Sti</italic> observed in this study showed the highest fold change (76.62 folds) expression among observed ESTs, however, exact biological role of these stress-inducible (Sti)-Hsps has not yet been elucidated [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is also reported that heat stress inducible proteins accumulated more in thermotolerant perennial creeping bentgrass (<italic>Agrostis scabra</italic>) as compared to heat susceptible species of grass, <italic>Agrostis stolonifera</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These stress inducible-Hsps can be further utilized for their potential role in HS response. Heat inducible genes were upregulated in transgenic plants overexpressing heat shock related transcription factor A (HsfA), transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing HSFA2 could rescue defects of mutant (HSFA1 QK mutant) under heat stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. CCDs (Carotenoid cleavage dioxygeneases) are non-heme important signalling molecules such as abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactone, further ABA plays important role in drought and HS tolerance, seed development and sugar signalling pathway. Very little information is available regarding molecular mechanism of CCDs, however CCD4 isoform from <italic>Crocus sativa</italic> was significantly induced by heat and dehydration stress treatment [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Further, an important co-chaperone of Hsp70, ss<italic>Dnaj</italic> plays an important role in assembly, protein folding and unfolding under stress conditions. Here putative <italic>Dnaj</italic> from wheat cv. C306 was upregulated (2.8 folds) under HS whereas susceptible cv. HD2967 showed fold change of only 0.8 fold. However, in this study several stress marker genes such as <italic>dhn</italic>, <italic>dun</italic>, <italic>wcor</italic> were not isolated from any of the two HS subtracted library. The possible reason could be that only limited number of clones were picked up, time duration of HS, presence/absence of these genes in two forward SSH libraries.

In plants, RAR1-SGT1-Hsp90 [(RAR1-Required for Mla12 (mildew resistance locus A) Resistance 1 and SGT1 is Suppressor of G2 allele of <italic>skp</italic>1 (suppressor of kinetochore protein)] complex binds in 1:1:2 ratio and confers tolerance to stress. The same complex is formed in animal cells at the time of immune response and is known to confer immunity against pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this work, <italic>TaHsp90</italic> was selected as a candidate gene for genomics, proteomics and <italic>in-silico</italic> based studies. Our results predicted that TaHsp90 was mostly found in cytoplasm with a CELLO prediction score of 3.767 which suggests its highly soluble and hydrophilic nature. Members of Hsp90 family possess penta-peptide MEEVD C-terminus which is a characteristic of cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. No transmembrane helix nor signal peptide was found in the TaHsp90 sequence. This could be one of the reasons for TaHsp90 not being targeted to any particular organelle. Wang et al. also reported nine cytosolic <italic>TaHsp90</italic> genes which were shown to be located on three different chromosomes i.e., 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> chromosome. They also reported that the presence of two introns in the genomic sequence of <italic>TaHsp90</italic> were responsible for variation in the length [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our TaHsp90 had 59 phosphorylating sites, this result was in contrast to that found by Kumar et al. which had shown 39 phosphorylating sites [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Phosphorylation capabilities of serine and threonine residues were more as compared to tyrosine and this finding was in uniformity with Basharat Z., who had predicted phosphorylation in Hsp70 of <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These kind of phosphorylated proteins are usually targeted to chloroplasts [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Site directed mutagenesis of important phosphorylated sites would elucidate the role of TaHsp90 under abiotic stress [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Many cell metabolic activities like RNA binding, splicing activity, protein-protein interaction, subcellular localization are influenced by phosphorylation. Zhang and Mount showed that two alternatively spliced isoforms of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SR45 protein (Ser-Arg rich) have different biological functions due to mutation caused at predicted phosphorylation site [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A refined 3D structure of TaHsp90 was generated successfully which can be used for understanding function at molecular level and active sites identification. However, structural significance of full length Hsp90 have been shown in bacteria, yeast and mammals [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We report here the secondary and 3D structure prediction of TaHsp90 which provides information related to active sites prediction and basic molecular functioning of the protein. Using PDB-PSI-BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/psiblast/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sss/psiblast/</ext-link>), TaHsp90 maximum identity deciphering was at 73% which is considered to be good score to start modelling. 3D structure was further verified by Ramachandran plot and it showed that 93.4% residues were in favoured region, validating the 3D protein conformation of TaHsp90. Further, digital expression of TaHsp90, and its close association with other genes was carried out. TaHsp90 digital expression at different developmental stages of wheat was mostly in the interquartile range (medium range) and similar pattern was observed for tissue specific expression pattern in 26 different anatomical parts. Developmental stage specific and tissue specific based expression pattern of TaHsp90 would be useful for selecting the wheat stage and tissue for qRT-PCR expression, transcriptome and molecular marker based studies. It was also found that the digital gene expression analysis revealed dynamic temporal expression of Hsp90 during different developmental stages of wheat, rice, maize and barley. The expression of Hsp90 remained relatively constant throughout the life cycle of rice and maize. The gene expression was found to be highest during flowering stage in barley while it showed attenuation in expression at the time of flowering in wheat. We speculate that this gene might be involved in multiple genetic pathways in involved in different developmental stages of crops especially flowering. Gene-specific expression provide evidence of when and where gene products may function and provide insights to the involved metabolic pathways which supports approaches for functional investigation through reverse genetics. Computational based studies of TaHsp90 would have greater practical significance not only related to its structure but also related to post translational modifications. Goswami et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] used different software tools available on server of GPS-polo 1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://polo.biocuckoo.org/">http://polo.biocuckoo.org/</ext-link>) for predicting the post translation modification sites (PTMs) and concluded that these PTMs may be used in manipulating the expression of genes/proteins associated with thermotolerance. Until now there is no report of cryo-atomic electron microscopic structure of Hsp90 from wheat, studies related to these would further help in understanding structural functioning and interaction with other molecules. Here, <italic>TaHsp90</italic> was validated for overexpression in a prokaryotic system, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 (DE3). The overepxressed TaHsp90 protein imparted tolerance to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli cells</italic> grown under HS conditions, confirming its role in HS response. There are reports in which genes from different plant species e.g. <italic>Dreb</italic> from <italic>Salicornia brachiata</italic>, <italic>Phytochelatin synthase</italic> from <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp., <italic>LEA</italic> gene from soybean, <italic>NAC4</italic> transcription factor from horsegram, <italic>Asr1</italic> from <italic>Ziziphus nummularia</italic> have been validated for overexpression in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, we reported <italic>TaHsp90</italic> from Indian wheat cv. C306, overexpression in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells. Functional validation of gene from plant systems in prokaryotic system are reported. <italic>TapAPX</italic> gene from heat tolerant cv. Raj3765 when cloned in an expression vector and transformed to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>., was able to provide HS tolerance to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells at elevated temperature [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, overexpression of <italic>Hsp90</italic> is known to provide abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants. Overexpression of <italic>Glycine max Hsp90</italic> was able to confer abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana Hsp90</italic> is coded by seven genes, of which <italic>AtHsp90</italic>.<italic>1</italic> is highly stress inducible and <italic>AtHsp90</italic> can be specifically inhibited by treating with geldanamycin (GDA) to study morphological abnormalities [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, Samakovll et al (2007), shown the importance of <italic>Hsp90</italic> in knock out lines lacking <italic>AtHsp90</italic> gene, these lines were lacking proper growth and were observed with other abnormalities like uneven growth of cotyledons, long hypocotyls, rootless seedling and triplet cotyledons [<xref rid="pone.0198293.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The study of <italic>TaHsp90</italic> in prokaryotic system as well as model plant systems will provide insights to its role under HS conditions and HS tolerance. <italic>TaHsp90</italic> can be taken up as a candidate gene for developing heat tolerant crop plants under the control of constitutive or stress inducible promoter either through marker assisted breeding or transgenic approach for a climate resilient agriculture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Average length distribution of heat stressed ESTs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Distribution of enzyme classes of HS libraries.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>GO analysis of heat stressed ESTs in three categories.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Interactive map plot of SSH libraries using REVIGO.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>ClustalW alignment of TaHsp90 with Hsp90 of other plant species.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>N-linked and O-linked glycosylation potential of TaHsp90.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0198293.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0198293.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>Comparative digital expression analysis of <italic>TaHsp90</italic> to closely related species.</title><p>A-<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>.
