However, little is known about the relationships and the underlying mechanisms between endogenous hormones and the occurrence of wheat tillers induced by exogenous hormones. In this study, two winter wheat cultivars, Xinong 979 and Xiaoyan 22, were used to investigate the effects of the exogenous application of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin (Z) on the occurrence of wheat tillers and investigate underlying mechanisms regulating the occurrence of tillers. The results showed that the application of IAA inhibited the occurrence of tillers, and external Z application promoted the occurrence rate of tillers under low nitrogen conditions. Further analysis of the results showed that exogenous IAA completely inhibited the growth of tiller buds, while exogenous Z significantly promoted the growth rate of tiller buds in low nitrogen conditions. Endogenous hormones exhibit important functions in regulating the growth of tiller buds, which contents were affected by exogenous hormones. Furthermore, according to the principal component analysis and correlation analysis, the growth of tiller buds was significantly positively correlated with the content of endogenous Z, whereas it was significantly negatively correlated with the ratios of endogenous IAA to endogenous Z (IAA:Z) and endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) to endogenous Z (ABA:Z). Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between the growth of the tiller buds and the endogenous IAA, endogenous gibberellins (GAs), and endogenous ABA content. These results suggested that Z played key roles in regulating the tiller occurrence, and exogenous hormones regulated the growth of wheat tiller buds via affecting the Z contents, thus regulating the occurrence of wheat tiller.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>hormonal</kwd><kwd>tiller</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>yield</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="12"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most essential crops worldwide (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Population growth and social development necessitate a rigid demand for high-yield wheat, which at present, mainly relies on raising yield per unit area (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the yield potential of wheat can be dissected into four major components: plant number per unit area, spike number per plant, grain number per spike, and grain weight (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu, 2013</xref>). The number of tillers of an individual wheat plant, which determines the spike number per plant, is an important agronomic trait for grain production (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Affected by environmental factors, the number of tillers is dynamic and adjustable (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Tiller development is greatly inhibited by abiotic stressors, such as drought, low nitrogen, and low temperature, resulting in lower crop yields due to a smaller population (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In contrast, too many surviving tillers owing to better environmental factors leads to a larger population, which may cause lodging in the late growth stage because of deterioration of the stem quality (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to construct a rational population structure for wheat to enhance yield potential and avoid lodging.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Difference in wheat population. <bold>(A)</bold> Too few surviving tillers leads to a smaller population, resulting in lower crop yields due to less spikes number per unit area. <bold>(B)</bold> Too many surviving tillers leads to a larger population, which may cause lodging in the late growth stage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01886-g001"/></fig><p>It is key to regulate the occurrence of tillers to obtain the proper number of tillers within a wheat population. The occurrence of tillers generally involves two developmental stages: the formation of axillary meristems in the leaf axil and the growth of tiller buds (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>). Of the two developmental stages, the former is mainly determined by genetics (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hyles et al., 2017</xref>), while the growth of tiller buds is more sensitive to environmental elements. Additionally, external treatments have a significant effect on the growth of buds (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Assuero and Tognetti, 2010</xref>). The occurrence of tillers is usually marked by the first complete leaf of the tiller protruding out of the coleoptile or tiller sheath (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Yu, 2013</xref>), indicating that the growth of tiller buds directly determines the occurrence of tillers. Therefore, promoting or inhibiting the growth of a tiller bud in a specific position can regulate the occurrence of this tiller. Currently, there is no effective technical approach for the direct control of the growth of wheat tiller buds.</p><p>The growth of tiller buds is regulated by a variety of hormones (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), of which indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the earliest discovered class of plant hormones that are synthesized at the apices and are transported down the polar base to inhibit the growth of lateral buds (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). External application of naphthyl acetic acid (NAA, a synthetic auxin) completely inhibits the growth of tiller buds in rice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011a</xref>). In contrast to IAA, cytokinins (CTKs) have a stimulatory effect on lateral bud outgrowth (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kariali and Mohapatra, 2007</xref>). Previous studies have shown that higher zeatin nucleosides (ZR, a cytokinin) can promote the sprouting of tiller buds in maize (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012b</xref>), and increasing the CTK content in tiller nodes can accelerate the growth of rice tiller buds (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to the regulation of IAA and CTK, other hormones also significantly affect the growth of lateral buds. The application of gibberellic acid (GAs) markedly inhibits the occurrence of crop tillers (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 1997</xref>). Consistent with this result, our previous study also showed that spraying GA<sub>3</sub> can significantly inhibit the growth of tiller buds. Moreover, external application of abscisic acid (ABA) slightly slows the growth rate of rice tiller buds (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011a</xref>). Further studies have found that exogenous ABA affected the growth of tiller buds by increasing the endogenous ABA content in tiller nodes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, external hormone application has been shown to be an effective measure to regulate the growth of tiller buds.</p><p>Similarities exist among different crops in physiological characteristics and growth regulation measures; however, there are also marked differences as well. Several relatively systematic studies have been conducted on the relationship between hormones and the occurrence of tillers in rice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and maize (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). However, there is limited information available about hormones and the occurrence of wheat tillers. Furthermore, some experiments have shown that IAA applied to the top of plants cannot enter lateral buds (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Booker et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that IAA does not directly inhibit the growth of lateral buds, and there may be secondary messengers that transmit IAA signals to lateral buds. At present, some hormones have been confirmed as secondary messengers such as CTKs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Domagalska and Leyser, 2011</xref>). Moreover, studies have also suggested that the function of GAs and ABA do not directly affect lateral buds but might change the content of other hormones to affect the growth of tiller buds (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Morris and Choonseok, 2006</xref>). Therefore, the role of hormones in regulating the growth of tiller buds needs to be further clarified.</p><p>In order to address these limitations of previous research (Currently, &#x02780; there is no effective technical approach for the direct control of wheat tiller occurrence at present; &#x02781; there is limited information available about hormones and the occurrence of wheat tillers; &#x02782; there are different opinions on the role of endogenous hormones such as IAA, CTKs, GAs, ABA in the growth of tiller buds.), the objectives of the present study were to investigate the effect of exogenous IAA and Z on the occurrence of tillers in wheat and analyze the relationship between endogenous hormones and the growth of wheat tiller buds. A greater understanding of these relationships, both positive and negative, can provide a theoretical basis to improve regulatory techniques for the effective construction of the canopy structure of high-yield wheat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The whole experiment consists of four small tests (2.1&#x02013;2.4).

In addition to genetics (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2016</xref>) and nutrition (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sakakibara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2014</xref>), hormones play key roles in the development of wheat tillering, and the external application of hormones can regulate the occurrence and growth of tillers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chatfield et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011b</xref>). The growth of target tillers regulated by exogenous hormones is closely related to the leaf age of crops at the time of treatment (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). In the present study, the occurrence of 0, I, and II were normal under different treatments because of the treatment time. The percentage of occurrence of III, I-p, IV, I-1, and II-p tended to decline as the application of IAA increased. Compared with the CK treatment, the exogenous application of Z had no obvious effect on promoting the occurrence of tillers.</p><p>The tillers develop from tiller buds. Further analysis of the effects of exogenous hormones on the growth of tiller buds shows that spraying IAA completely inhibited the growth of tiller buds, which is similar to the findings described by a previous study (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011a</xref>). But in the present study, exogenous Z treatment had no obvious effect on the growth of tiller buds. The growth of tiller buds is directly related to endogenous hormones (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we measured the hormone dynamics throughout an entire experimental period, and found that the content of endogenous Z increased as the growth of tiller buds progressed. External IAA application significantly reduced the Z content compared with the control, while the Z levels increased significantly after the application of exogenous Z in a short period but then no significant difference was observed in the CK and Z treatment groups. Therefore, we speculate that exogenous Z does not promote the growth of tiller buds because the external application of Z has no significant effect on endogenous Z.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that nitrogen is a substrate for CTK synthesis, thus regulating the concentration of nitrogen in the environment can change the level of endogenous CTK (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this finding, we also conducted a nitrogen experiment to further analyze the role of Z in regulating the growth of tiller buds under two different N environments. The results showed that the endogenous Z content of plants in the low-nitrogen treatment group was significantly lower than that in the CK group, and the growth rate of tiller buds also showed a significant slowing of growth. In addition, the application of Z on the plants in the low-nitrogen treatment showed a significant increase in the endogenous Z content. Compared with the low-nitrogen treatment group, the growth rate of tiller buds of the LN+Z group was significantly accelerated. This indicates that exogenous Z can effectively promote the growth of tiller buds in an environment low in nitrogen. Subsequently, we set up a low-nitrogen treatment in the field, verifying that exogenous Z can significantly increase the survival rate of high position tillers under low N conditions, and thus promote the occurrence of wheat tillers.</p><p>Accordingly, we conclude that plant hormones can effectively control wheat tiller occurrence, and the application of exogenous hormones changes the growth of tiller buds via affecting the endogenous hormone content, thus regulating the occurrence of tillers in wheat. Exogenous IAA could inhibit the occurrence of tillers and reduce the quantity of wheat population; exogenous Z can increase the survival rate of tillers when the growth of tiller buds is affected by biotic and abiotic stressors, thereby increasing the population.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship Between Endogenous Hormones and the Growth of Tiller Buds</title><p>External factors influence wheat tillering through physiological effects, which are predominantly mediated by the variations in hormone content (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kariali and Mohapatra, 2007</xref>). IAA and CTK play important roles in regulating the growth of plant lateral buds (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, IAA inhibits the tillering process by producing apical dominance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Leopold, 1949</xref>). <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2011a)</xref> also reported that the application of NAA completely inhibited the growth of rice tiller buds. Our data clearly demonstrated that exogenous application of IAA completely inhibited the growth of wheat tiller buds, thus our findings are consonant with previous studies. However, some experiments have shown that the application of exogenous IAA to the top of the plant does not enter the lateral buds (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Booker et al., 2003</xref>). In this experiment, the external application of IAA significantly increased the content of endogenous IAA in the tiller node but had no obvious effect on the IAA content in the tiller buds. Also, reducing the auxin content in the stem via the application of growth polar transport inhibitors does not promote the occurrence of lateral buds (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, according to the PCA and correlation analysis, no significant correlation was observed between the growth of tiller buds and the level of endogenous IAA, indicating that IAA does not directly inhibit the growth of lateral buds, and there may be a secondary messenger that transmits IAA signals to the lateral buds. A previous study has suggested that the second messenger has CTKs, etc. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Domagalska and Leyser, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Cytokinin promotes cell division and plays a key role in the growth and differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Through the phenotypic analysis of the mutants of the CTK signaling receptor system, a previous study has found that overexpressing CTK in the recessive mutant has a multi-branched phenotype (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Manuella et al., 2002</xref>) and the petunia mutant also showed multiple branches through enhancing the expression of an isoamyl transferase gene (synthesis of active CTK) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Elena et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, higher CTK content can promote the germination of corn tiller buds (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>) and the growth of rice tiller buds (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In this experiment, endogenous CTK showed an upward trend during the normal growth of wheat tiller buds. By reducing the nitrogen concentration of the nutrient solution to reduce the endogenous CTK in the plants, the growth rate of the tiller buds slowed, and this rate could be adjusted by exogenous application of CTK to change the endogenous CTK content. All the above research has demonstrated that CTK directly promotes the growth of tiller buds.</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that the synthesis and accumulation of CTK are regulated by IAA; in addition, as an upstream signaling hormone, IAA inhibits the synthesis of CTK in plant tissues (roots, stems, etc.) and its translocation to other organs (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Nordstr&#x000f6;m et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we also found that after the application of exogenous IAA, the endogenous Z content decreased during the growth of tiller buds and was lower than that of plants grown under normal conditions. Based on the above results, we conclude that endogenous Z plays a leading role in the regulation of the growth of wheat tiller buds, while the effects of endogenous IAA are more indirect. Exogenous IAA regulates the accumulation of endogenous Z by affecting the distribution and quantity of IAA in the plant, and then inhibiting the growth of the tiller buds.</p><p>In addition to the effects of IAA and CTK on tillering, there are many reports on the relationship between GAs and tillering. Spraying GA<sub>3</sub> can significantly inhibit the occurrence of crop tillers (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 1997</xref>). Some studies have speculated that exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> inhibits the growth of tiller buds by affecting plant nutrition (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2006</xref>), but <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2011a)</xref> pointed out that the growth of tiller buds is not necessarily related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants, and the buds growth is mainly regulated by hormone metabolism. In this experiment, the PCA and correlation analysis indicated that there was no significant correlation between endogenous GAs and tiller growth. <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Phillips (1975)</xref> suggested that GAs indirectly affects apical dominance by inducing IAA synthesis or inhibiting IAA decomposition. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al. (2013)</xref> further found that exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> affects the growth of tiller buds by changing the endogenous ratios of IAA to Z and ABA to Z. Furthermore, ABA is closely related to lateral bud dormancy (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Pei et al., 1998</xref>). Some studies have shown that the higher ABA content in the regenerated buds of rice is the main factor inhibiting the buds growth (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1997</xref>), and the increase in endogenous ABA content of wheat tillers inhibits the further development of tillers and leads to decline (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ma and Liang, 1997</xref>).</p><p>However, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2011a)</xref> concluded that there was no significant correlation between ABA and the growth of tiller buds in rice; our previous study also found that spraying ABA did not completely inhibit the growth of wheat tiller buds, but only slowed its growth rate, indicating that ABA is not the main factor regulating the growth of tiller buds. However, some results have revealed that the application of ABA significantly increased the ratio of ABA to Z, while higher ABA:Z inhibited the growth of tiller buds and promoted the decline of tillering (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2012a</xref>). Therefore, ABA mainly influenced the growth of tiller buds via the balance of ABA to Z. Additionally, a few studies have indicated that the mechanisms of axillary bud outgrowth depend on the relative content of endogenous hormones rather than the absolute level of an individual hormone (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shimizu-Sato and Mori, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). The data from the present study agreed with these results in that the ratios of IAA to Z and ABA to Z were significantly negatively correlated with the growth of wheat tiller buds, indicating that the ratios had an essential role in the growth of tiller buds. Nevertheless, our data also showed that the endogenous Z content increased with the growth of tiller buds, while the IAA and ABA levels remained nearly constant during the entire experimental period. These results suggest that the difference in IAA:Z and ABA:Z was more due to the variation of the Z content. Therefore, we can conclude that exogenous hormones affected the accumulation of endogenous Z in the tiller nodes and buds through altering the synthesis and distribution of endogenous hormones, thus regulating the growth of wheat tiller buds.</p><p>However, at this stage, the mechanism by which hormones regulate the growth of wheat tiller buds is understood at the physiological and biochemical level, but research is lacking at the molecular level. Recently, some new plant hormones have been discovered, such as strigolactone (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Umehara et al., 2008</xref>), but the role of these hormones in the growth of wheat tiller buds and how these can be applied to the control of wheat tiller occurrence are currently poorly understood. Therefore, these issues need to be further studied and clarified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We proposed and verified a technical approach to effectively regulate the growth of wheat tillers: when the number of wheat population grew too large, the number can be reduced by applying IAA to inhibit the occurrence of tillers; and when the population number was less than the expected value, exogenous Z can be sprayed to promote tillering so as to increase the number. Multiple hormones regulate the growth of wheat tillers. For the different opinions on the role of endogenous hormones in the growth of tiller buds at present, the following results have been obtained through experiments. Exogenous IAA completely inhibited the growth of tiller buds through reducing endogenous Z levels. External application of Z increased the endogenous Z content, thus promoting the growth of the wheat tiller buds. The PCA and correlation analysis demonstrated that the growth of the tiller buds was significantly positively correlated with the content of Z, suggesting that Z plays key roles in regulating the occurrence of tillers, and exogenous hormones regulated the growth of wheat tiller buds via affecting endogenous Z levels, thus regulating the occurrence of tillers in wheat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>).</p><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>FIGURE 12</label><caption><p>The regulatory mechanism of exogenous IAA and Z on the occurrence of wheat tiller.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01886-g012"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DY, XR, and TC conceived and designed the experiments.
