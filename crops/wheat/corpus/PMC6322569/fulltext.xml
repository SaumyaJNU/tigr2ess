With the aim of testing the role of the carbon sink&#x02013;source relationship under different CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, we performed two experiments with two barley genotypes (Harrington and RCSL-89) exposed to changing CO<sub>2</sub>. In Experiment 1, the genotypes were exposed to 400 and 700 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> induced photosynthetic acclimation in Harrington that was linked with the depletion of Rubisco protein. In contrast, a higher peduncle carbohydrate-storage capacity in RSCL-89 was associated with a better balance of leaf carbohydrates that could help to maximize the photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In Experiment 2, plants that were grown at 400 ppm or 700 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> for 5 weeks were switched to 700 ppm or 400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Raising CO<sub>2</sub> to 700 ppm increased photosynthetic rates with a reduction in leaf carbohydrate content and an improvement in N assimilation. The increase in nitrate content was associated with up-regulation of genes of protein transcripts of photosynthesis and N assimilation that favoured plant performance under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, decreasing the CO<sub>2</sub> from 700 ppm to 400 ppm revealed that both stomatal closure and inhibited expression of light-harvesting proteins negatively affected photosynthetic performance and plant growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Barley</kwd><kwd>carbohydrates</kwd><kwd>elevated CO<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>N assimilation</kwd><kwd>peduncle</kwd><kwd>photosynthetic down-regulation</kwd><kwd>sink&#x02013;source</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has increased from around 280 ppm recorded at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (1780) to approximately 400 ppm at present, and it is expected to increase to over 900 ppm by the end of the 21st century, depending on the climate-change emission scenario (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>). While it would be logical to assume enhanced photosynthetic assimilation in C<sub>3</sub> plants due to the increase in CO<sub>2</sub>, several studies have shown that a build-up of leaf carbohydrate linked to higher CO<sub>2</sub> availability might induce a reduction in carboxylation efficiency (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Prolonged exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> often induces stomatal closure with a consequent impact on CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the chloroplast, which would partly explain the decline in photosynthetic carboxylation capacity (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Non-stomatal limitations can also lead to a down-regulation of photosynthesis due to a decrease in the amount and activity of Rubisco, and this is accompanied by the accumulation of carbohydrates. Several factors have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of CO<sub>2</sub> acclimation, including insufficient plant sink strength (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007</xref>), nitrogen (N) dilution by accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Stitt and Krapp, 1999</xref>), and/or inhibition of nitrate assimilation (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Enhanced leaf C content caused by greater photosynthetic rates in plants exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> could lead to repression of photosynthesis-related genes and to a down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The build-up of leaf carbohydrate has been associated with the capacity to develop strong C sinks, such as developing organs (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, the presence of higher C sink strengths could contribute to preventing photosynthetic down-regulation via a better redistribution and allocation of carbohydrates to the developing sinks under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Plants with a greater capacity to remobilize the &#x02018;extra&#x02019; photoassimilates to organs with a higher C demand could have a similar advantage.</p><p>Nitrogen assimilation has also been identified as a key process that influences photosynthetic performance under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Photosynthesis provides C skeletons for assimilating N into amino acids to form proteins and other nitrogenous compounds. The imbalance between C fixation and N assimilation has been suggested as the main factor responsible for photosynthetic down-regulation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth and Long, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, limitations in N assimilation observed in plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> have been associated with a reduction in energy availability, which would have effects on C and N metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Rachmilevitch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Such limitations in energy availability would modify the C/N ratio by increasing the carbohydrate content and decreasing the N pool due to competition for reductant (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Rachmilevitch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Assimilation and remobilization of C compounds is important during grain filling. To sustain grain filling in C<sub>3</sub> cereals, photoassimilates are mainly provided from photosynthesis in the upper leaves, predominantly the flag leaf and penultimate leaves in barley and the flag leaf in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hosseini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), from the remobilization of C stored in leaves and peduncles that was assimilated before anthesis (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gebbing and Schnyder, 1999</xref>), and from photosynthesis in the ear (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Tambussi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Sucrose, fructans, and starch are the most important carbohydrates that affect crop performance during the grain-filling period in barley. Sucrose is the major transported form of carbohydrate and it provides most of the energy and C necessary for the growth and development of non-photosynthetic organs. Together with starch, fructans have been described as the major C storage compounds in different cereal organs such as the grains, leaves, stems, and roots (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Morcuende <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition to their role as reserve carbohydrates, fructans also provide C and energy to non-photosynthetic tissues when the C demand is high (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Xue <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Van den Ende, 2013</xref>). In addition, carbohydrates can also act as signal molecules that regulate the expression of a wide variety of genes involved in different metabolic pathways and cellular functions (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Osuna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Van den Ende, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Valluru, 2015</xref>). Fructan synthesis is activated when sucrose content exceeds a threshold concentration (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Pollock and Cairns, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Koroleva <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The increase in sucrose content increases fructosyltransferase gene expression, whereas high nitrate content inhibits its expression (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Morcuende <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). A close correlation between increases in carbohydrate content and the down-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and N metabolism has been recently reported (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the search for more productive varieties, conventional plant-breeding programs have reduced the genetic diversity of crops by the use of &#x02018;elite&#x02019; varieties that have lost alleles relevant to specific environmental conditions (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Ellis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Dawson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The intensive plant-breeding programs conducted over recent decades have mainly been focused on the selection of genotypes with high harvest indices. However, such selection has not contributed to overcoming sink&#x02013;source limitations (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Maydup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Schmid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). To recover some of the favourable alleles lost during plant-breeding programs, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Matus <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> developed a recombinant chromosome substitution line (RCSL) population of 140 lines using the wild ancestor of barley, <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> subsp. <italic>spontaneum</italic>, as a source of donor alleles for <italic>H. vulgare</italic> subsp. <italic>vulgare</italic> cv &#x02018;Harrington&#x02019;, which is commonly used as a quality standard in North America. The recovered genes in the RCSL-89 line showed higher tolerance to abiotic stress by accumulating more carbohydrates under drought (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;ndez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Adaptation of crops to future atmospheric conditions will require a better understanding of how plants respond to increasing C content. In this study, we took two approaches to investigate the importance of the C sink&#x02013;source balance in the responsiveness of plants to different CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. The first goal was to determine the relevance of the balance in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. For this, barley genotypes with high (RCLS-89) and low (Harrington) capacities to store C/N compounds in the peduncles were exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The second goal was to characterize and identify mechanisms developed by plants to regulate their C sink&#x02013;source balance under changing CO<sub>2</sub>. For this, two sets of 64 plants were grown. The first set was initially exposed to ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (400 ppm) followed by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (700 ppm), and the second set was initially exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (700 ppm) followed by ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (400 ppm). The comparisons made between the responses of elite cultivars and newly developed genotypes have implications for future breeding programs that seek adaptive alleles to maintain the C sink&#x02013;source balance under changing CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and experimental design</title><p>Seeds of the two barley genotypes, <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> subsp. <italic>vulgare</italic> cv Harrington and RCLS-89 (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Matus <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), were kept at 4 &#x000b0;C for 10 d to synchronize germination.

The experimental set-up was designed as two experiments in parallel.

For Experiment 2, a set of 16 plants that had been grown for 5 weeks at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e. up to flag-leaf emergence) were then exposed for the following 6 weeks to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (400&#x02013;700 treatment).

Indeed, an insufficient demand for carbohydrates from developing C-sinks has been observed to induce leaf C imbalances (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The peduncle has a special importance in the C-storage capacity for maintaining leaf C balance during the vegetative stage in cereals (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Tambussi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Later, during the grain-filling period, the C stored in the peduncle is remobilized towards the grain. In our study it was notable that in both barley genotypes, higher fructan contents were found in peduncles than in flag leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), showing the importance of these organs for the subsequent grain filling-stage.</p><p>Inadequate C-sink strength can lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity so that C-source activity and sink capacity are balanced (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> decreased <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub> and the relative Rubisco content in Harrington (which has a low capacity to store C/N compounds in the peduncles), while an increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub> was found in RCSL-89 (high capacity to store C/N compounds in peduncles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The decline observed in Harrington was consistent with the photosynthetic down-regulation response widely observed under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In addition, the depletion in Rubisco content in these plants, together with the decreases in amino acids and soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), reduced the levels of leaf organic-N compounds, as has been observed in previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In contrast to Harrington, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> led to an increase in the soluble protein content in RCSL-89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This suggested an improvement in leaf organic-N compounds that could have helped to maximize photosynthetic capacity, which is consistent with the higher <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub> observed under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in RCSL-89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, the drastic increase in ear biomass under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in RCSL-89 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) indicated that the strong sink capacity of this organ was especially important in the photosynthetic performance of this genotype under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The distribution of photoassimilates from flag leaves to the peduncles may have contributed to the avoidance of carbohydrate build-up under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Our results suggested that the improved leaf C balance in RCSL-89 may have helped to maintain N status, and consequently plants avoided photosynthetic down-regulation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Similar to effects observed previously in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), in Harrington the down-regulation of genes encoding the Rubisco large subunit, together with decreased transcripts for proteins involved in light-harvesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) and the lower Rubisco content under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), may have contributed to the photosynthetic acclimation that we found in this genotype. The fact that at 700 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> Harrington had a higher starch content than RCSL-89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) may indicate that the flag leaves of Harrington were subjected to C sink&#x02013;source imbalance. It should be noted that starch has been proposed as a way to store excess C in plants, while leaf sucrose content is suggested to represent the main form of C translocated towards developing sinks (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Stitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This highlights the fact that impaired N assimilation, and consequently reduced Rubisco protein availability, could be linked to leaf C sink&#x02013;source imbalances (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Aranjuelo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">White <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In our study, NR activity was not significantly affected by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the flag leaves of either Harrington or RCSL-89 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggested that CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment did not restrict leaf nitrate reduction, which is in contrast with decreases reported in other species (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The higher sucrose content in RCSL-89 could have contributed to the maintenance of NR expression and activity (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Morcuende <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) and to sustaining the activity of GS (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Robredo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), with a consequent impact on amino acid and protein availabilities under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, GS has been described as a target enzyme involved in N and C metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Vega-Mas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The decline in GS and GDH activities decreased the nitrate-assimilation pathway in Harrington flag leaves, which in turn altered the contents of amino acids and other organic-N compounds under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, the maintenance of the activities of these enzymes observed in RCSL-89 flag leaves would guarantee assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids. Indeed, total soluble protein levels increased in RCSL-89 flag leaves under exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These findings suggest that a limitation in N assimilation could be involved in the decline in organic-N compounds and the down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity found in Harrington plants under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The improved photosynthetic acclimation responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the RCSL-89 genotype were associated with enhanced flag-leaf N assimilation and a consequent increase in organic N compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, the higher sink capacity of the peduncle and the ears would have facilitated the correct leaf C/N balance and overcome the photosynthetic down-regulation due to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, confirming the importance of C-sink strength for increased crop yields under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Experiment 2: a balance in C and N metabolism modulates adaptability to changing CO<sub>2</sub></title><p>As observed in Experiment 1, photosynthesis in plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is limited by the ability to adjust photosynthetic activity according to leaf C demand (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Ziska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). To evaluate the adaptation capacity of the two barley genotypes to changing environmental CO<sub>2</sub>, plants were grown under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (400 ppm) or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (700 ppm) and then exchanged between treatments.</p><p>Increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration caused similar responses in <italic>A</italic><sub>N</sub>, <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>i,</sub> and relative Rubisco content in both genotypes relative to plants grown continuously at 700 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Harrington maintained its photosynthetic capacity compared to plants grown continuously at 700 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub> observed in RCSL-89 grown continuously at 700 ppm was not detected when it was initially grown at 400 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The ability to overcome photosynthetic acclimation may be linked to the up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in light-harvesting and the maintenance of Rubisco gene expression and protein content (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Hence, our findings suggested that Harrington plants did not suffer photosynthetic down-regulation or, at least, that they showed a better photosynthetic capacity than RCSL-89 under increasing CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In agreement with previous findings by <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Stitt <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>, the higher starch content observed in Harrington compared to RCSL-89 grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) could be considered a symptom of C overflow due to the rate of photosynthesis exceeding the rate of leaf C demand. This imbalance may have been associated with the down-regulation of amino acid storage, in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Yamakawa and Hakata, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Midorikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the starch content did not differ in the peduncles of either genotype after increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, but RCSL-89 showed higher storage capacity for fructans in the flag leaves and peduncles than Harrington.</p><p>Increasing the CO<sub>2</sub> increased the activity of NR in flag leaves of both Harrington and RCSL-89 relative to plants grown continuously at 700 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This indicated that the reduction of leaf nitrate was unaffected by CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment, which is in contrast to the reduction in the N pool reported in other species grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). More notably than in the first experiment, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment induced the expression of NR genes and increased the nitrate content, as has been observed previously (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Stitt and Krapp, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), while increasing the amino acid content and reducing the sucrose and starch contents relative to plants grown at 700 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>. The competition for reductants in the chloroplast stroma has been described as a factor that conditions C and N assimilation (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Rachmilevitch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). For this reason, the leaf light-harvesting complexes and proteins involved in electron transport may be particularly important in maintaining the energy necessary for balancing both N and C metabolism. In agreement with <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Vicente <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)</xref>, we observed that exposure to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> induced the expression of PSII light-harvesting complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). More than 50% of the N that is assimilated by roots is allocated to flag leaves and comprises Rubisco, light-harvesting complexes, and other proteins involved in electron transport (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kitaoka and Koike, 2004</xref>). Our results suggested that increasing CO<sub>2</sub> from 400 ppm to 700 ppm caused concomitant increases in <italic>A</italic><sub>N</sub> and nitrate content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and reductions in carbohydrate content (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) by increasing energy availability for co-ordinating C and N assimilation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. These findings suggest that this stimulation of N assimilation could be involved in the increase in the amino acid content and the capacity to overcome the initial photosynthetic down-regulation found in Harrington under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Decreasing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from 700 ppm to 400 ppm after flag-leaf emergence caused significant stomatal closure and reduced photosynthetic rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), which were associated with lower biomass in Harington plants (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Stomatal limitations are one of the mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic down-regulation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Bloom <italic>et al.</italic> (2002</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) reported that a reduction in <italic>A</italic><sub>N</sub> increases nitrate assimilation because NR has access to a larger amount of NADH for reducing nitrate to nitrite. Our results suggested that plants exposed to decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> suffered energy limitations due to a lower expression of light-harvesting complexes and reaction centres when compared to plants grown continuously at 400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This photosynthetic limitation was reflected by a decrease in the leaf carbohydrate contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, the peduncles of RCSL-89 plants showed a greater accumulation of starch, which is associated with long-term carbohydrate storage. In accordance with the photosynthetic limitations, genes related to photosynthesis, such as light-harvesting, Rubisco, and chlorophyll synthesis, were down-regulated, or at least showed similar expression to plants grown at 700 ppm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Comparing Harrington and RCSL-89, the higher fructan content in the peduncles of RCSL-89 could have been linked to the repression of fructosyltransferases (particularly sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase), which are involved in fructan synthesis. The lower sucrose and starch-storage capacity in flag leaves, together with the accumulation of fructans in the peduncles, revealed that the lower photosynthetic capacity acted to modify the C/N balance. In this regard, the lower biomass, especially in terms of ear weight, together with the lower levels of amino acids and proteins as well as the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes suggested that the plants attempted to adapt to the new environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Conclusions and future perspectives</title><p>Our study has highlighted the importance of the C/N balance as influenced by photosynthesis and N assimilation in two barley genotypes exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and the relevance of the peduncle sink capacity to this balance. Our study showed that in genotype Harrington, which has a low capacity to store C/N compounds in the peduncles, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment decreased photosynthetic capacity whereas genotype RCSL-89, which has a higher capacity, could overcome photosynthetic down-regulation under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. The larger C-sink capacity of RCSL-89 enabled the avoidance of a build-up of leaf carbohydrates and enabled the maintenance of Rubisco protein in the flag leaves. On the other hand, the leaf C sink&#x02013;source imbalance of Harrington plants grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> was linked to a depletion of Rubisco content and a consequent decrease in <italic>V</italic><sub>cmax</sub>. The increased expression of transcripts associated with light-harvesting complexes and changes to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion were shown to be significant in influencing plant growth and C and N metabolism when the CO<sub>2</sub> conditions were modified. Increasing CO<sub>2</sub> from 400 ppm to 700 ppm reduced leaf carbohydrate contents and improved N assimilation. On the other hand, decreasing the CO<sub>2</sub> from 700 ppm to 400 ppm led to both stomatal closure and repression of transcripts of light-harvesting proteins, showing them to be the main factors involved in the inhibition of photosynthetic machinery and plant growth.</p><p>Within the context of current environmental conditions and those projected for the coming decades, it is crucial to increase crop yields through the development of cultivars that are resilient to environmental changes. While the work now underway in plant breeding programs is of great importance, there is a risk that alleles crucial to adaptations to this unpredictable future might be lost when selecting modern elite crop cultivars. Moreover, as evidenced here and in earlier studies, the introgression of genes from wild genotypes into modern varieties could overcome some sink&#x02013;source limitations. Together, our results show that the RCSL-89 barley line has a greater responsiveness to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> than the elite Harrington cultivar, highlighting the potential contribution that adaptive alleles from wild genotypes have to breeding programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s21"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1.
