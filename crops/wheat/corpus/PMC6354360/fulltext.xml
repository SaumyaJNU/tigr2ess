Pups born from the second pregnancy had reduced tissue elastance compared to pups born from the first pregnancy, regardless of the dam&#x02019;s diet. As there was reduced offspring survival born to dams fed a high fat diet, the statistical power of lung function measures of offspring was limited.

There are many plausible explanations for how obesity could cause asthma. These include environmental influences, genetic predisposition, comorbidities, mechanical changes associated with increased body weight, direct contribution of adipokines like leptin, and low-grade systemic inflammation induced by obesity. There is also the possibility that foetal programming events that occur via maternal obesity could contribute towards asthma development in childhood. Most epidemiological analyses have concluded that maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is linked with an increased risk of wheezing in the first years of life and childhood asthma (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). These observations around increased risk for wheeze in early life are likely to be independent of maternal atopy or asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is up to a 50% increased odds of asthma in children of obese/overweight mothers (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). These observations suggest that maternal obesity could contribute significantly towards asthma susceptibility and other associated respiratory problems (like those induced by viral infection).</p><p id="Par23">The in utero and neonatal periods are particularly critical as abnormal weight gain at these times may have irreversible or exacerbating effects on the development of both obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Maternal obesity may induce foetal programming of the immune, metabolic, and respiratory systems to increase the chance of childhood asthma, but maternal obesity is a complex exposure, which could be related to a range of dietary, environmental and genetic factors. While direct foetal programming could explain the observed positive relationships between maternal obesity and offspring asthma, it is quite plausible that they are confounded by either shared environmental or genetic risk factors for both maternal obesity and childhood asthma. Epidemiological studies do not prove that maternal obesity is a cause of childhood asthma, and may be confounded by environmental or genetic risk factors, for example, excessive gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Furthermore, the mechanism(s) by which maternal obesity increases asthma risk in offspring are yet to be determined. Some suggested biological mechanisms for the maternal obesity-childhood asthma link include: foetal exposure to high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines, stress hormones, oxidative stress and glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; placental inflammation and dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; increased rates of pregnancy, delivery and neonatal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; increased use of reproductive technologies and prescriptive medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; and, an involvement of intestinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or lung microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given the complexity of maternal obesity as an exposure, animal models promise to help elucidate the nature and mechanisms behind this association.</p><p id="Par25">The ability of maternal obesity to promote the development of obesity in offspring is well established in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. High fat diet intake by murine dams during pregnancy and lactation induces a phenotype in offspring that closely resembles human metabolic syndrome with abnormal glucose homeostasis, increased blood pressure, abnormal serum lipid profiles, increased adiposity and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Feeding mice a high fat diet can also induce inflammation, whereby increased eosinophils, interleukin-5 (IL-5), eotaxin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)&#x003b1; and leptin were observed in the lungs with the induction of allergic airway disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other studies report similar effects of a high fat diet to induce lung eosinophilia, but without adverse effects on lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, not all studies report adverse effects of consuming a high fat diet in mice with allergic airway disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">More recent studies have identified that maternal high fat diet or over-nutrition reduces surfactant mRNA or protein expression in the lungs of foetal and neonatal mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with some researchers identifying adverse effects on lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with effects on lung function in early life not yet described. These are important studies to complete, and may help us determine the potential of maternal obesity and metabolic dysfunction, and high fat diet exposure in early life to contribute towards the development of asthma in childhood. We hypothesized that maternal obesity and metabolic dysfunction (induced pre-conception) would modify the lung function of offspring in early life to potentially contribute towards the development of respiratory dysfunction in later life. To test this, we used a model of maternal high fat intake to induce substantial weight gain and metabolic dysfunction prior to mating, with a high fat diet fed to mice throughout pregnancy and lactation periods. We then tested the respiratory (and other health outcomes) of 2&#x02009;week-old offspring (before weaning), and dams, using our optimised forced oscillation technique (FOT) in which we measured lung function in neonatal mice at 2&#x02009;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the earliest age (and size) for which this is currently technically possible in mice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par27">Experiments were performed according to the ethical guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and with approval from the Telethon Kids Institute Animal Ethics Committee (AEC#280).

A number of metabolic measures were recorded for dams throughout the initial 12&#x02009;weeks of consuming either diet (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and detailed below). After 12&#x02009;weeks of consuming either diet, female mice were housed with male mice for 14&#x02009;days as trios (2 females and 1 male) for breeding. Significant weight gain of greater than 4&#x02009;g within 10&#x02009;days of co-housing dams with the male mouse was a good predictor of successful impregnation (more so than the presence of vaginal plugs) regardless of whether mice were fed a low or high fat diet. After confirmation of pregnancies, dams were separated and housed individually and visually monitored for the birth of offspring. Dams and their offspring were not disturbed (with no cage changes) from when pregnancies were confirmed and dams were separated into individual cages, until offspring reached 1&#x02009;week of age, although extra nesting material was provided to dams in the week prior to the birth of their offspring. Mice were mated a second time 1&#x02009;week after the first litters of 2&#x02009;week-old mice were removed for acquisition of body weight, metabolic, lung function and other data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was done because of the poor survival of litters from the first pregnancies (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> below), and to examine the potential effect of multiple pregnancies on dam outcomes. Female mice were 22&#x02009;weeks of age at this time, and had been fed either diet for 18&#x02009;weeks. Lung function and other respiratory measures were recorded from 2&#x02009;week-old offspring of the second litters and 33&#x02009;week-old dams (fed either diet for 29&#x02009;weeks) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

By measuring lung function at 2&#x02009;weeks of age, we can also be reasonably certain that the direct consumption of high fat diet (through food, and not in milk) by offspring is avoided.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the experiment<italic>.</italic> From 4&#x02009;weeks of age, C57Bl/6&#x02009;J female mice (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) were separated into 2 treatment groups and fed either a low fat diet (LFD, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) or high fat diet (HFD, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14). Fasting glucose and insulin levels were determined in these female mice after being fed the diets for 5, 7, 9, 11 and 18 (glucose only) weeks. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed after female mice had been fed either diet for 11&#x02009;weeks. Female mice were first mated with C57Bl/6&#x02009;J male mice, after dams had been fed either diet for 12&#x02009;weeks. Three weeks later, offspring were born. Dams were re-mated 1&#x02009;week after their first litters were removed at 2&#x02009;weeks of age. The lung function of all surviving offspring (of both pregnancies) was measured when these mice reached 2&#x02009;weeks of age. After lung function assessments were completed, BALF was collected from most neonates to determine the proportions of major cell types, and levels of cytokines and adipokines. In a small subset of the neonates, lungs were fixed for structural assessment.

Pups were tracheotomised with a 10&#x02009;mm length of 21&#x02009;G needle secured with surgical silk before being placed inside a whole-body plethysmograph and connected to a small animal ventilator (Minivent; Harvard, March-Hugstetten, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mice were ventilated at 400 breaths/min at a tidal volume of 10&#x02009;mL/kg and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Once on the ventilator all mice received a slow deep inflation to P<sub>rs</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, followed by another inflation 5&#x02009;min later to standardize the lung volume history. Immediately after this, thoracic gas volume (TGV) was measured by plethysmography. TGV is the volume of gas contained within the chest during plethysmography when the airway opening is occluded. In mice, this is roughly equivalent to the functional residual capacity of the lung. Two electrodes were inserted into the intercostal muscles, the ventilator was stopped and the airway opening and plethysmography box were briefly closed. Six one-second-long box (P<sub>box</sub>) and tracheal (P<sub>trachea</sub>) pressure measurements were recorded using two pressure transducers (Validyne MP45; Validyne Engineering, Northbridge, CA, USA; and model 8507C-2; Endevco, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA, respectively). Inspiratory breathing efforts were created during the 6&#x02009;s by stimulating the intercostal muscles with electrical impulses (~&#x02009;20&#x02009;V amplitude and 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;s in duration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The constant phase model was used to partition Z<sub>rs</sub> into Newtonian resistance, tissue damping, tissue elastance and and hysteresivity. Newtonian resistance (R<sub>n</sub>) is the impedance to the flow of air in the non-respiratory portions of the lungs. As the mice were tracheostomised in this study, this refers to the impedance to airflow in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Tissue damping (G) reflects the energy dissipation in the alveoli. It can also be thought of as the resistance of the respiratory portions of the lungs. Tissue elastance (H) reflects the energy conservation in the alveoli. It can also be thought of as the &#x0201c;stiffness&#x0201d; of the lung parenchyma. Hysteresivity (&#x003b7;; G/H, a measure of the degree of heterogeneity of ventilation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Inertance values were negligible and are not reported. Due to the high compliance of the chest wall, R<sub>n</sub> is equivalent to airway resistance (R<sub>aw</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As reported in the results section, the number of animals per treatment for these outcomes varied based on the mechanical and technical limitations of our lung function assessment equipment, where while we are able to ventilate very small mice and measure Z<sub><bold>rs</bold></sub> using the FOT, when fitting the constant phase model to impedance, if any measurement artefacts occur (e.g. due to cardiac interference, non-optimal placement of the endotracheal tube etc), they can result in a poor model fit and thus render some or all components of the constant phase model fit invalid. In very small mice, as we were studying here, ideal model fits are very difficult to obtain, despite our experience in this area. Further, as we report specific parameters of lung function for 2-week old offspring (which are corrected to TGV), a valid measurement of TGV is required for each experimental animal. We are not able to analyse TGV measurements &#x0201c;on-the-fly&#x0201d; so it is only later that we are able to tell with certainty that any particular animal has a valid TGV measurement. If that animal does not have a useable TGV, it is not possible to report specific parameters of lung function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Responsiveness to methacholine in dams</title><p id="Par34">Lung function and responsiveness to methacholine were measured in dams using the legacy Scireq flexiVent (Scireq, Montreal, Canada) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The flexiVent system was required to obtain responsiveness measurements to MCh as the wave-tube system used for the pups does not allow methacholine to be introduced into the ventilatory circuit. As with the pups, dams were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine and xylazine (diluted with 0.9% Sodium chloride solution prior to being tracheotomised with a 1&#x02009;cm length of cannula (internal diameter 0.086&#x02009;cm). They were then attached to the flexiVent and ventilated at 450 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 8&#x02009;mL/kg and a PEEP of 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Following standardisation of the lung volume history via three slow deep inflations to a respiratory system pressure of 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, respiratory mechanics at functional residual capacity were determined using the low frequency FOT and fitting of the constant phase model to Z<sub>rs</sub>. Measurements were taken once per min for 5&#x02009;min. Then a 10&#x02009;s challenge of saline aerosol, and increasing doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30&#x02009;mg/mL) of methacholine (Acetyl &#x003b2;-methacholine chloride, Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich, MO, USA) were delivered by an ultrasonic nebulizer (DeVilbiss UltraNeb, Somerset, PA, USA).

The high fat diet significantly increased body weight, weight gain and WAT deposits in female mice (dams-to-be), and induced metabolic dysfunction (elevated fasting glucose and glucose intolerance) prior to breeding. Reduced litter survival was observed for pups born to dams fed the high fat diet. Those pups that did survive until 2&#x02009;weeks of age were longer, weighed more, and had increased lung volumes compared with offspring born to dams fed the low fat diet. However, the high fat diet did not compromise the lung function of offspring, with no significant effect on specific airway resistance, tissue damping or tissue elastance. Eating the high fat diet also increased the lung volume of dams, as well as specific airway resistance, tissue damping and elastance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and responsiveness to methacholine (tissue damping and elastance, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). No overt signs of inflammation were observed in the BALF of offspring of dams fed a high fat diet, while increased TNF&#x003b1;, IL-5, IL-33, and leptin levels were observed in BALF of their mothers. These findings suggest that maternal consumption of a high fat diet during the preconception, pregnancy and lactation periods increases somatic growth, which is likely linked with increased lung volume of both the offspring and dams, and that long-term consumption of a high fat diet modifies lung function and promotes respiratory inflammation in adulthood.</p><p id="Par49">While significant increases in lung volume and body size (weight and length) were observed in offspring born to dams fed a high fat diet, we also observed a non-significant increase in airway resistance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.089). This failure to achieve significance may have been caused by the low sample size (an effect of the maternal high fat diet on offspring survival), with the 30% difference likely to be biologically significant (HFD mean SRaw is 55.9&#x02009;hPa.s; LFD mean SRaw is 39.3&#x02009;hPa.s). We also observed some non-significant reductions in the mean linear intercept length of offspring born to dams fed the high fat diet (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08), perhaps indicative of more fully developed lungs. In the mouse, 50% of alveolar septa form between days 4 and 14 of life with a further 40% between days 14 and 36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], suggesting that our measurements of lung function at 2&#x02009;weeks of life, were done during a period of rapid alveolarization. Interestingly, recent studies suggest &#x02018;airway dysanapsis&#x02019; may exist in obese children, which is defined as the &#x02018;incongruence between lung and airway growth&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In obese children, airway dysanapsis is demonstrated by increased lung volume, and reduced airflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our observations of increased lung volume and a trend towards increased airway resistance are suggestive of a similarity to those of airway dysanapsis in obese children, although it is important to note that the stage of development of lungs in young mice and children may not be equivalent, as most alveolarization occurs post-birth in the lungs of mice (unlike humans) (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). Together, these studies indicate that the increased nutrition supplied during exposure to high fat diet in utero and lactation increases lung (and body) size, with a reduction in mean linear intercept suggestive of &#x02018;more fully developed&#x02019; lungs but has detrimental effects on other aspects of lung development. A future goal could be to determine if there is a window of high fat diet exposure (e.g. pre-conception, gestation, lactation), which is responsible for increasing lung volume in offspring.</p><p id="Par50">Clinically, the &#x02018;obese asthma&#x02019; phenotype in childhood is characterized by increased severity, reduced disease control and impaired quality of life (compared with age-matched, non-obese individuals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Obese asthma in children may not be associated with airway or systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, we did not observe any signs of inflammation (or mucus) in the lungs through histopathological assessment (data not shown) or measurement of cytokines and adipokines in BALF in offspring born to dams fed a high fat diet. Indeed, levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-5 and IL-33 were below the level of detection of the assay in many samples. In contrast, obese asthma in adults is associated with increased airway and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], consistent with our observations of increased TNF&#x003b1;, IL-5, IL-33 and leptin concentrations in the BALF of dams fed the high fat diet. It might be that further exposure to a high fat diet, and/or other stimuli (e.g. viral infection/allergen), with immune maturation, are required for offspring to produce significant cytokine levels in the lung. In similar studies, exposure to high fat diet during lactation (only) induced an early-onset obesity in offspring (C57BL/N mice) at 3&#x02009;weeks of age, with increased expression of mRNAs of IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A and TNF&#x003b1; in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Interestingly, the effect of exposure to the high fat diet during lactation was transient, with no difference in these cytokine mRNAs observed in the lungs of offspring when they reached 10&#x02009;weeks of age, and limited effects on peribronchial elastic fibre content, bronchial smooth muscle mass and connective tissue deposits in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

The effects of high fat diet in inducing airway dysfunction and inflammation may not be limited to exposures during pregnancy, with post-weaning intake of a high fat diet increasing airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and promoting neutrophils and higher IL-6 levels in the BALF in 10&#x02009;week-old BALB/cByJ mice previously fed a high fat diet from 3&#x02009;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Ongoing early life and post-weaning exposure to high fat diet can also promote fibrosis in the lungs, with increased transforming growth factor-&#x000df; and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin protein levels observed in the lungs of 12&#x02009;week-old offspring born to Sprague-Dawley dams fed a high fat diet for 9&#x02009;weeks before mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Reduced concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites and enhanced arginase levels were also observed in the lungs of adult offspring of C57Bl/6&#x02009;J dams fed a high fat diet for 6&#x02009;weeks prior to mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These observations may explain the increased tissue elastance (lung stiffness) responses observed in dams fed a high fat diet, following methacholine challenge. Together, these findings suggest that multiple interacting pathways are induced by maternal exposure to high fat diet to cause lung dysfunction and potentially increase susceptibility for obese asthma in offspring.</p><p id="Par52">There are two types of adult asthma induced by obesity: 1) early onset asthma complicated by obesity (Th2 (Th2)-skewed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; and, 2) late-onset with a low Th2 phenotype. This late-onset phenotype is linked with non-atopic asthma in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and has a distinct clinical phenotype, characterized by neutrophilic airway and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], obstructed and restricted lung function, increased severity and hospitalization rates, reduced disease control and quality of life and impaired responsiveness to corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Our observations of increased Th1 (TNF&#x003b1;) and Th2 (IL-5, IL-33) cytokine concentrations in the BALF of dams fed a high fat diet, without any neutrophilia or eosinophilia suggest that these mice are &#x02018;poised&#x02019; to react to further allergenic or viral exposure. However, our findings of increased lung volume in dams fed a high fat diet are not aligned with ongoing hypotheses of the effects of obesity on lung function in humans, in which it is thought that excessive accumulation of fat in the thoracic and abdominal compartments compresses the lungs to reduce lung volume and increase risk for peripheral airway and parenchyma collapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These differences in the effects of obesity on lung volume measurements in mice compared with human (as adults), could be explained by differences in the orientation of mice vs humans (supine vs sitting) when lung function is being assessed. Our means of testing lung function, with mice in the supine position under general anaesthetic may allow for more extensive lung inflation than achievable in humans.</p><p id="Par53">Another interesting finding of our study was an independent effect of second pregnancy on offspring weight and lung function outcomes. Offspring from pregnancy two weighed more than offspring of pregnancy one (regardless of the diet of the mother). It is possible that the increasing age of female mice increased the risk for pregnancy complications that could contribute towards increased body weight of offspring. Older women are at increased risk for gestational diabetes, independently of pre-gestation BMI and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We did not measure any metabolic outcomes during either pregnancy due to concerns that even small interventions in the dam could affect litter survival especially those fed the high fat diet. However, reduced fasting glucose levels were observed in dams fed a high fat diet that were able to become pregnant a second time (immediately prior to mating), suggesting that some adaption to the effects of high fat diet may be necessary to become pregnant a second time (although most of these pregnancies were not successful). It may be that glucose metabolism was further adversely affected in the second pregnancy. Furthermore, maternal age, and multiparity may interact to produce different maternal environments that modify the lung development of offspring. Conversely, other studies suggest that immune training experienced in the first pregnancy may support better placentation events in second pregnancies through the activity of specific subset of natural killer cells and increased expression of molecules that support vascularization (e.g. VEGF&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Similarly, we also observed reduced levels of the innate Th2 cell-promoting cytokine IL-33, and the adipokine, leptin in the lungs of dams fed a high fat diet that were pregnant twice. Interestingly, increased expression of these mediators has been shown to promote asthma exacerbation and airway hyper-reactivity in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Furthermore, reduced tissue elastance (and adiponectin levels in BALF) was observed in the offspring of the second pregnancy of dams fed either diet; suggesting that there may be protective effects of a second pregnancy that extend to the offspring in some developmental niches (i.e. the lungs).</p><p id="Par54">Others have also recorded adverse effects of maternal high fat diet consumption on foetal and neonate survival. A 2-fold reduction in foetal survival (at embryonic day 18) was observed in pregnant C57Bl/6&#x02009;J dams fed a high fat diet for 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;months prior to mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Increased perinatal death rates were observed in Sprague-Dawley dams fed a high fat diet for 4&#x02009;weeks prior to mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Obesity and excessive weight gain also increases risk for early miscarriage, complications and stillbirth in human pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Han et al. (2017) observed in ICR mice, that maternal consumption of a high fat diet impaired the expression of the Stella protein in oocytes, resulting in pronuclear epigenetic asymmetry in zygotes and DNA damage, increasing rates of foetal and neonatal death, and promoting the development of aberrant metabolic phenotypes in surviving offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. It may be that high fat diet consumption also has epigenetic effects in genes essential for optimal lung development.</p><p id="Par55">Our initial reasoning for feeding dams the high fat diet for 12&#x02009;weeks was to demonstrate metabolic dysfunction (e.g. increased glucose intolerance, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) in addition to increased body weight prior to mating mice. At the time of our experiments (early 2015), there were only a few reports published describing some moderate adverse effects of high fat diet on offspring survival. For example, Krasnow et al (2011) reported higher mortality (23%, compared to 3% for low fat diet) for pups born to second pregnancies for C57Bl/6&#x02009;J dams fed a high fat diet for 12&#x02009;weeks (prior to mating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In a model very similar to our own, King et al (2013) reported that fewer pups were born to dams fed a high fat diet for 12&#x02009;weeks prior to and during mating, as well as lactation, compared to dams fed a low fat diet (high fat diet&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.0 pups/litter (mean), control diet&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.5 pups/litter (mean) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, the effects of our maternal high fat diet model on offspring survival were more severe (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The reasons for this difference are unclear, although they could have been mediated through differences in animal housing or diet (our high fat diet was 46%, versus 58% digestible lipid for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]). Alternatively researcher-based issues may account for the observed differences between these studies. Indeed, handling of mice by male researchers may be more stressful for mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and the person mainly handling animals in our study was male. This may have contributed towards higher than expected rates of litter death (potentially due to increased cannibalization rates) for first-time C57Bl/6&#x02009;J mouse mothers, with high rates of offspring death also observed for dams fed the low fat diet (following the first pregnancy).</p><p id="Par56">Due to the low survival rates of litters born to dams fed a high fat diet, we were unable to compare the effects of maternal consumption of the high or low fat diet on offspring outcomes in a representative pup of each sex from each litter (with litter as <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1/sex), as recommended by some statisticians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As litter sizes were not significantly different between treatments, it was unlikely that in utero death contributed towards the increased size of pups born to dams fed a high fat diet. Our findings of reduced sex ratio (fewer males than females) born to dams fed a high fat diet are consistent with the <italic>Sex Allocation Hypothesis</italic> of Trivers and Wallard (1973), who state that; &#x0201c;as maternal condition declines, the adult female tends to produce a lower ratio of males to females&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These negative effects of maternal high fat diet on offspring survival (and sex ratio) are important limitations for consideration in this study, and substantially reduced our statistical power for measures done in offspring.</p><p id="Par57">We also recognize the limitations of using rodents as model animals to examine lung development. In rodents, lung alveolarisation is completed post-natally, unlike humans and sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, we report findings that are consistent with those of other researchers who have used mice, rats, and sheep as model animals to investigate the effects of maternal high fat diet consumption (or overnutrition) on offspring lung development. Similarly, our findings largely recapitulate the clinical phenotypes of obese asthma in children and adults. Our model could be useful to measure the potential interacting or exacerbating effects of maternal atopy or respiratory infection during pregnancy on the obese asthma phenotype in childhood. Similarly, the influences of other environmental exposures during pregnancy and early life will be important to explore, including; allergen exposure, pollution, living with pets, sun exposure, activity and other diet influences as well as the importance of the timing of high fat diet exposure, and the influence of high fat diet through the gut and/or lung microbiomes.</p><p id="Par58">Our findings of increased body weight in offspring, were very similar to those of other research teams, who fed C57Bl/6&#x02009;J dams a high fat diet for 3&#x02009;months prior to mating, with offspring exhibiting increased body weights at 2&#x02009;weeks of age, and preference for sugary and fatty foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Similar findings on the effects of maternal high fat diet on 2&#x02009;week-old offspring body weight have also been reported, when C57Bl/6&#x02009;J dams were fed a high fat diet for a shorter period of time (for &#x02264;8&#x02009;weeks pre-mating) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The effects of maternal high fat diet on body weight of young C57Bl/6&#x02009;J offspring coincide with other signs of adiposity, including body composition and adipose tissue weights. Krasnow et al (2011) described that newborn (P0) pup born to dams fed a high fat diet for 4&#x02009;weeks before mating had increased body weights, percentage body fat and hepatic fat levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Maternal high fat diet for 6&#x02009;weeks prior to mating, increased body weight, WAT deposit weights and blood triglyceride levels in 3&#x02009;week-old offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Consumption of a high fat diet during gestation and lactation increased body weights, WAT deposit weights and blood triglyceride, glucose and insulin levels in 3&#x02009;week-old offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Dinger et al (2016) reported that maternal high fat diet during lactation increased body weight and epigonadal WAT deposits in 3&#x02009;week-old offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The effects of maternal high fat diet in promoting increased somatic growth of offspring, including body length, have been previously reported as epigenetically heritable features (across multiple generations) linked with changes in growth hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. While we observed increases in both body weight and length, this was accompanied by increases in BMI, suggesting the changes in weight exceeded those effects on length. Together, these data suggest that maternal high fat diet consumption increases multiple signs of obesity in young C57Bl/6&#x02009;J offspring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par59">In conclusion, we report here that maternal intake of a high fat diet and the establishment of metabolic dysfunction prior to pregnancy may modify the development of the lungs of offspring, by increasing body size, lung volume and potentially causing changes in lung morphology, which need to verified through further experimentation. These effects may be unrelated to inflammation in offspring, but could be influenced by in utero exposure to maternal inflammation induced by ongoing consumption of the high fat diet. Our model may recapitulate clinical phenotypes of pediatric and adult obese asthma in humans, and can be used in future studies to explore the influence of environmental exposures on the development of metabolic and respiratory dysfunction in early life, to potentially identify new interventions that promote better metabolic health during pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>(S)G</term><def><p id="Par5">(Specific) tissue damping</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(S)H</term><def><p id="Par6">(Specific) tissue elastance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>(S)R<sub>aw</sub></term><def><p id="Par7">(Specific) airway resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BALF</term><def><p id="Par8">Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par9">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FOT</term><def><p id="Par10">Forced oscillation technique</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GTT</term><def><p id="Par11">Glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>I<sub>aw</sub></term><def><p id="Par12">Inertance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-</term><def><p id="Par13">Interleukin-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEEP</term><def><p id="Par14">Positive end expiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>P<sub>rs</sub></term><def><p id="Par15">Transrespiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>R<sub>n</sub></term><def><p id="Par16">Newtonian airway resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGV</term><def><p id="Par17">Thoracic gas volume</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p id="Par18">Tumour necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WAT</term><def><p id="Par19">White adipose tissue</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Z<sub>rs</sub></term><def><p id="Par20">Respiratory system impedance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x003b7;; G/H</term><def><p id="Par21">Hysteresivity</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the technical assistance of Ms. Sian Geldenhuys and Ms. Naomi Fleury.
