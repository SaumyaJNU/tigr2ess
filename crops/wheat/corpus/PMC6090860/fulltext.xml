Bread wheat (BW) evolved from a natural hybridization of the tetraploid cultivated emmer wheat <italic>T. turgidum</italic> L. ssp. <italic>dicoccon</italic> (Schrank) Thell. (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28; AABB, a progenitor of modern durum wheat) with the wild diploid <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> Coss.

Generation of hexaploid wheat from a few accessions of <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> followed by limited gene flow from <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> to hexaploid wheat led to limited D-genome diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Intercrosses of existing elite wheat germplasm in each breeding cycle and selection has further narrowed the genetic diversity by the depletion of a few alleles from a more diverse gene pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such narrow genetic diversity of elite wheat germplasm is a challenge for sustainable wheat production, which is needed for a rapidly growing world population with the predicted dramatic climate changes and other emerging abiotic and biotic stresses.</p><p id="Par14">One approach for broadening the genetic base of BW is utilizing genes from cultivated tetraploid wheat (<italic>T. turgidum</italic>) and from wild relatives (<italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>) through synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The SHW, often designated as primary synthetic wheat, is a recreation of wheat by crossing between modern durum wheat and wild goat grass. The SHWs provide a rich source of novel genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and often confer resistance to biotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The D-genome from SHW is reported to have higher nucleotide sequence diversity than the D-genome from BW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The lack of sequence diversity in the D-genome of BW can be noted from the number of SNPs identified in the A or B genome which usually ranges from two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] to five- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] times higher than SNPs identified in the D genome.

Hence, wheat genome diversity, especially the D-genome diversity, in BW could be improved by crossing to SHW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Also, the SHWs used in this study have not been used previously for genetic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (i) investigate genetic diversity in unique sets of diverse SHW accessions (101) using SNPs derived from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) platform, (ii) decipher the presence of population structure in SHW collection, and (iii) compare genetic diversity among SHWs and 12 elite wheat cultivars (comprising 10 cultivars from Lincoln, Nebraska and two from Turkey) to determine the prospects of broadening the genetic base of BW using SHW. Understanding the genetic diversity and population structure of SHWs will help in effectively using these novel genetic resources in breeding programs to broaden the genetic base of wheat, identify novel genes/genomic regions associated with multiple stresses and useful traits, and utilizing such regions/genes in marker assisted breeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par16">Initially, 139 SHWs were analyzed for genetic diversity and population structure (Additional&#x000a0;files&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

However, in a different study of 477 <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> accessions, <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> were divided into two lineages (<italic>Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii</italic> and <italic>ssp. strangulata</italic>) having little genetic overlap in the clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Genetic diversity</title><p id="Par38">Analysis of molecular variation suggested that the population differentiation exists in two subgroups obtained from Bayesian clustering algorithm, where most of the variation was accounted by within population variance. Gene diversity (H<sub>S</sub>) for each subgroup showed that genetic variation in SHWs ranged from 0.18 (Spring_SHW) to 0.31 (Winter_SHW) with an overall gene diversity of 101 SHWs was 0.33. In Spring_SHW group, only one durum parent was used with different accessions of <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> parents indicating that genetic variation observed within Spring_SHW was largely due to <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> parents (D-genome diversity). Furthermore, the D genome gene diversity within 101 SHWs was 0.31 and genetic diversity of diploid parents (<italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>) from SHWs would expected to be very diverse and novel. The SHWs had a significantly higher level of gene diversity (H<sub>S</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32 to 0.33) compared to elite BW cultivars (H<sub>S</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17 to 0.25) in the present study. Similarly, higher gene diversity in SHWs have been reported in the past using AFLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and SSR markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], indicating the usefulness of SHWs in introducing novel sources of genetic diversity into elite BW germplasm. For instance, gene diversity in 54 SHWs using AFLP marker was 0.39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Mean genetic diversity in SHWs using SSR markers reported in past were 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], 0.61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and 0.69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In general, the gene diversity of SNP makers is low due to its bi-allelic nature whereas SSR markers are high due to its multi-allelic nature. The gene diversity of SHWs using SNP makers in the past were lower than the present study. For instance, lower genetic diversity in SHWs compared to the present study was reported by Zegeye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], who evaluated 181 SHWs using 2590 SNP markers and found the genetic diversity ranged from 0.24 (B genome) to 0.26 (D genome).</p><p id="Par39">The gene diversity of BW cultivars (10 cultivars from Nebraska, USA and two cultivars from Turkey) in our study ranged from 0.17 to 0.25. Similar results were obtained in a study of a diversity panel of 369 Iranian hexaploid wheat accessions. The gene diversity using SNP markers in Iranian wheat landraces and cultivars ranged from 0.14 to 0.20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The genetic diversity using GBS derived 20,526 SNPs in 8416 Mexican wheat landraces ranged from 0.06 to 0.26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The set of SHWs in our study had greater genetic diversity and was reported to have a multiple resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This result suggests that the SHWs under study may provide a novel source of genetic diversity (novel alleles for a trait of interest) to the elite wheat breeding program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">The present study provided a detailed understanding of genetic diversity and population structure of 101 SHWs and revealed high genetic diversity in the SHW compared to elite BW cultivars. Population structure analysis revealed that SHWs developed from diverse accessions of durum wheat and <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> originated from different countries were divided into two (Spring_SHW and Winter_SHW) distinct groups based mainly on geographical location of durum parents and growth habit of the crop. Further population structure analysis of durum and <italic>Ae.</italic> parents separately identified two subgroups, mainly based on type/pedigree or origin of parents used. Although <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> parents were divided into two groups mainly based on type of parent used, <italic>Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii</italic> and <italic>ssp. strangulata</italic> did not separate entirely in each subgroup. The GBS derived SNPs were able to identify the inaccurate pedigree of synthetic hexaploid wheats based on misclassifications of some of the durum or <italic>Ae.</italic> parents from analyzing 139 SHWs and such misclassifications may have resulted due to heterozygous or heterogeneous parent lines, partial sterility and outcrossing, or seed handling error/mechanical mixing.</p><p id="Par41">This study found that the percentage of SNPs on the D genome was nearly equal to that of other two genomes (A and B), which is unique to the SHWs as compared to previous studies on BW that reported that the D genome had less than 50% of the SNPs compared to A and B genomes. This result indicated the presence of high variation in the D genome in the SHWs. Furthermore, the gene diversity of SHWs under study was higher in all three genomes compared to elite BW cultivars and the greatest increase in gene diversity (88.2%) was observed in the D genome of SHWs compared to BW cultivars. Such higher genetic diversity in SHWs suggests that the diversity could be utilized in the elite wheat-breeding program to broaden the genetic diversity and increase genetic gain. The markers with high genome coverage such as GBS derived SNP markers are helpful for elucidating the population structure and genetic diversity. The results of this study will provide valuable information for wheat genetic improvement through inclusion of novel genetic variation and facilitate the discovery of novel source of genes/genomic regions conferring resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses from association mapping study to unravel economically important marker-trait associations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
