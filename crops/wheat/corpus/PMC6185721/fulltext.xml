<italic>culmorum</italic> during the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease on wheat. A wheat cytochrome P450 gene from the subfamily CYP72A, <italic>TaCYP72A</italic>, was cloned from wheat cultivar CM82036. <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> was located on chromosome 3A with homeologs present on 3B and 3D of the wheat genome. Using gene expression studies, we showed that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> variants were activated in wheat spikelets as an early response to <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, and this activation was in response to the mycotoxic <italic>Fusarium</italic> virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON). Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) studies in wheat heads revealed that this gene family contributes to DON resistance. VIGS resulted in more DON-induced discoloration of spikelets, as compared to mock VIGS treatment. In addition to positively affecting DON resistance, <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> also had a positive effect on grain number. VIGS of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> genes reduced grain number by more than 59%. Thus, we provide evidence that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> contributes to host resistance to DON and conclude that this gene family warrants further assessment as positive contributors to both biotic stress resistance and grain development in wheat.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/1A/2508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1953-6070</contrib-id><name><surname>Doohan</surname><given-names>Fiona M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10/IN.1/B3028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1953-6070</contrib-id><name><surname>Doohan</surname><given-names>Fiona M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>We acknowledge Science Foundation Ireland for providing funding (project nos. 10/IN.1/B3028 and 14/1A/2508).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytochrome P450s are heme-containing membrane-bound enzymes that can perform several types of oxidation-reduction reactions [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

There is compounding evidence to show that cytochrome P450s play a role in the host response to diseases, including the wheat response to Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>FHB is a devastating fungal disease of wheat, barley and other small grain cereals grown in warm and humid regions worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (teleomorph: <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic>) is the principal causal agent of the disease. It infects wheat heads during flowering and thereby interferes with seed development leading to severe yield loss and reduced grain quality [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> also produces trichothecene mycotoxins in infected grains, predominantly deoxynivalenol (DON), which are harmful to plant, human and animal health [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some cereal varieties are resistant to FHB disease. DON was shown to induce cytochrome P450 genes in FHB-resistant genotypes of wheat and barley. Comparing wild type and <italic>Tri5</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>
<italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> DON-minus mutants, Boddu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] identified several cytochrome P450 transcripts that were specifically induced during trichothecene accumulation in barley plants. A cytochrome P450 gene, <italic>CYP709C1</italic>, associated with resistance to FHB and Fusarium seedling blight in wheat was highly induced in wheat spikelets inoculated with DON [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In barley, cytochrome P450s were induced in spikelets in response to DON application [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Walter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] showed that the transcript levels for two cytochrome P450s were significantly higher in progeny of a wheat population that inherited a genetic locus associated with FHB resistance as compared to those that did not. It remains to be determined whether cytochrome P450s are associated with detoxification of DON or the transformation of other disease/toxin-induced moieties. Indeed, there is no evidence that plant cytochrome P450s directly affect DON resistance, either via a role in detoxification or by other means. But recently, a bacterial cytochrome P450 was shown to catabolise DON to a derivative that was much less toxic to wheat [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Here we characterized the mycotoxin-responsive cytochrome P450 first identified by Walter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and investigated its potential to respond to and improve DON and FHB resistance. The gene clustered within the CYP72A subfamily and is hereafter referred to as <italic>TaCYP72A</italic>. Gene expression studies investigated the effect of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> and the mycotoxin DON on the regulation of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> homeologs in wheat. The effect of VIGS of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> on the DON sensitivity of wheat was investigated. The VIGS experiment also assessed the contribution of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> genes to grain development. Based on the results of this study, we describe the first wheat cytochrome P450 variants to positively contribute to both DON resistance and grain development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant and fungal material and propagation</title><p><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (wheat) cultivars (cvs.) CM82036 (a cross between &#x02018;Sumai-3&#x02019; and &#x02018;Thornbird-s&#x02019;) and Remus were used in this study.

Indeed, comparing DON and Tween 20 treatment in BSMV:00-treated tissue, it was evident that DON treatment did not significantly reduce either grain number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204992.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) or grain weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204992.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). But, gene silencing with either BSMV:CYP1 and BSMV:CYP2 exacerbated the negative effect of DON on grain weight, and significantly so for the former construct (31% reduction in grain weight in BSMV:CYP1-treated plant when comparing DON versus Tween 20 treated heads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204992.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Overall the results led us to conclude that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> positively influences grain development.</p><fig id="pone.0204992.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204992.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Effect of silencing <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> genes on grain number and weight in both mock and DON-treated heads of wheat cultivar CM82036.</title><p>Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) was conducted as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204992.g004">Fig 4</xref> (flag leaf VIGS treatments being empty virus BSMV:00 or treatments BSMV:CYP1 and BSMV:CYP2 which target <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> variants for silencing); subsequently, emergent heads were treated with 10 &#x003bc;l of 5 mg ml-1 DON or 0.02% Tween 20 (mock treatment).

Using the RNA from the same time course experiment as used herein, Perochon et al. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] recently reported that the transcription of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> DON biosynthetic gene <italic>FgTri5</italic> peaked at 2 dpi, and this coincides with the peak in pathogen induction of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic>. Thus, we concluded that the expression of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> was coincident with toxin biosynthesis. Perochon et al. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also reported that both the DON-minus mutant and the wild type <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> induced a defence response in wheat, as determined via qRT-PCR analysis of the defence marker gene <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> Pathogenesis-Related-1 (<italic>TaPR1</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, since <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> was only induced by the wild type fungus and not the mutant, we conclude that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> is activated as part of the wheat response to toxin production rather than as part of a general defence response against <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>.</p><p>Cytochrome P450s of CYP72 family belong to the non-A type cytochrome P450s which include highly divergent group of sequences that show local similarity to non-plant cytochrome P450s than to other plant cytochrome P450s and function in lipid or hormone metabolism while the A-type P450s are involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The CYP72A subfamily from the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> comprises a cluster of 8 cytochrome P450s, however their functions are still unknown [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The enzymatic function of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> remains unknown, with no close homolog being biochemically characterised. Several homologs have been annotated as secologanin synthase proteins based on their homology to <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> protein CYP72A1. But the homology between this protein and TaCYP72A is 51% and we should not infer anything from this as it appears to be typical that even closely related CYP72A proteins are involved in different pathways, suggesting that CYP72A functional evolution is independent of the other CYP72As in each plant species [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Trichothecenes are potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis and DON inhibits the peptidyl transferase activity in 60S ribosome subunit [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It may be that the induction of the <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> and its homeologs is a downstream response to the protein synthesis inhibitory activity of trichothecenes, as gene expression studies confirmed that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> is responsive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (unpublished data).</p><p><italic>TaCYP72A</italic> is the first plant cytochrome P450 gene subfamily shown to enhance DON resistance in plants. This was validated via gene silencing in the plant of origin, wheat. <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> acts either to alleviate DON-induced stress or is directly involved in DON detoxification as a component of the classical xenobiotic detoxification pathway [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The increase in the number of DON-bleached spikelets in <italic>TaCYP72A-</italic>silenced wheat plants suggests that this gene subfamily might directly affect either DON detoxification or translocation. A wheat UDP-glucosyltransferase (<italic>TaUGT3</italic>) and a barley UDP-glucosyltransferase (<italic>HvUGT13248</italic>) have been cloned which were able to convert DON to DON-3-O-glucoside [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, DON naturally possess a hydroxyl at the glucosylated C-3 atom [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and thus there is no obvious need for cytochrome P450 activity to precede that of UGT. A cytochrome P450 enzyme from a DON-utilising bacterium, <italic>Sphingomonas sp</italic>., was shown to catabolise DON <italic>in vitro</italic> and the reaction product was identified as 16-hydroxy-DON [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In a bioassay using wheat seedlings, 16-hydroxy-DON showed reduced toxicity compared to DON [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This demonstrates that hydroxylation of DON is a DON detoxification mechanism and cytochrome P450s are capable of detoxifying DON independent of phase II enzymes. It is not known if a similar DON detoxification mechanism exists in plants. The bacterial enzyme and <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> belong to different subfamilies of cytochrome P450s.</p><p>The DON detoxification model proposed in animals by Sobrova <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] suggests that cytochrome P450s might oxidise the free hydroxyl groups of DON to form DON radicals which might then be scavenged by antioxidant enzymes or conjugated with glutathione (GSH). The co-expression of wheat cytochrome P450 genes, including <italic>TaCYP72A-840</italic>, with UGTs, GSTs and ABC transporters [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggests that that plants might possess a variant of the proposed DON detoxification model in animals. The model suggests that cytochrome P450s might metabolise DON and the metabolites can be further conjugated with GSH for extrusion. DON-glutathione (GSH) conjugate was discovered as one of several DON conjugates in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. That study also detected five other DON conjugates that remain to be characterised, thus highlighting the fact that we know very little about the DON biotransformation mechanisms that exist <italic>in planta</italic>. And recently, we found that a DON-responsive ABC family C drug transporter contributes to DON resistance in wheat. VIGS analysis of the encoding gene reduced wheat resistance to DON [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus there is compounding evidence for the activation and toxin-induced up-regulation of detoxification pathways in wheat. More importantly, there is evidence that they are important components of defence against DON.</p><p>Note that we also validated that overexpression of a variant of <italic>TaCYP72A-3A</italic> enhances FHB resistance in wheat (and positively affects grain development). This data is not presented because, unfortunately, based on the new wheat genome, we realised that there are three non-synonymous mutations in the overexpressed gene as compared to <italic>TaCYP72A-3A</italic> (but not in the active site). Nonetheless, collectively the results give us great confidence that <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> and variants thereof can enhance DON resistance.</p><p>While other subfamilies of CYP genes have been shown to influence both grain size and number [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], this is the first report that a CYP72A gene influences yield from wheat. This is the second gene that both enhances DON resistance and alters grain development; Walter et al. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that the DON-responsive ABC transporter <italic>TaABCC3</italic>.<italic>1</italic> enhanced DON resistance and affected grain formation. Indeed, based on a transcriptome study by Chetouhi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0204992.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], they concluded that the molecular responses to FHB in a susceptible cultivar was congruent with those for grain development (at least in a susceptible genotype). Genes involved in the response to both FHB and grain development and the interaction of these two responses were enriched for those involved in GTP catabolic process, histone lysine methylation, response to growth hormone stimulus, embryo development, responses to pathogen and drug transmembrane transport. It is therefore without doubt that the &#x02018;omics&#x02019; study of transgenics overexpressing gene such as <italic>TACYP72A-840</italic> will give insights into both FHB disease resistance and grain development. We are currently analyzing the allelic diversity of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> across a broad array of wheat genetic stocks to determine if SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) within the gene promoter or gene are associated with various traits. Working with breeders, we aim to determine if such markers are of benefit for FHB resistance breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204992.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of the chromosome 3A variants of <italic>TaCYP72A</italic> from wheat cvs. CM82036 and Remus with chromosome 3A, 3B&#x02019;s and 3D homeologs from wheat cv.
