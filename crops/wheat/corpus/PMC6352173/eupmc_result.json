    "The detection of liquor quality is an important process in the liquor industry, and the quality of Chinese liquors is partly determined by the aromas of the liquors. The electronic nose (e-nose) refers to an artificial olfactory technology. The e-nose system can quickly detect different types of Chinese liquors according to their aromas. In this study, an e-nose system was designed to identify six types of Chinese liquors, and a novel feature extraction algorithm, called fuzzy discriminant principal component analysis (FDPCA), was developed for feature extraction from e-nose signals by combining discriminant principal component analysis (DPCA) and fuzzy set theory. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA), DPCA, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, leave-one-out (LOO) strategy and k-fold cross-validation (k = 5, 10, 20, 25) were employed in the e-nose system. The maximum classification accuracy of feature extraction for Chinese liquors was 98.378% using FDPCA, showing this algorithm to be extremely effective. The experimental results indicate that an e-nose system coupled with FDPCA is a feasible method for classifying Chinese liquors."
