We performed an experiment using radiolabelled Zn (<sup>65</sup>Zn), and <italic>in situ</italic> time-resolved elemental imaging using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), to investigate the behaviour of two commonly used Zn foliar fertilizers (Zn sulphate and ZnEDTA) in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) leaves. Both experiments showed that Zn had limited mobility in leaves, moving &#x0003c;25 mm from the application point after 24 h. Although limited, the translocation of Zn occurred quickly for both treatments; moving more between 3 h and 12 h after application than between 12 h and 24 h. Speciation analysis using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) showed that ZnEDTA was in fact taken up in chelated form and not as ionic Zn (Zn<sup>2+</sup>). The XANES data also showed that Zn, from both treatments, was then complexed by ligands in the leaf (e.g. phytate and citrate), potentially in response to localized Zn toxicity. The results of the present study provide important insights into the behaviour of commonly used foliar-applied Zn fertilizers, and can be used to optimize current fertilization strategies and contribute to the development of more efficient foliar Zn fertilizers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biofortification</kwd><kwd>chelated zinc</kwd><kwd>foliar fertilizer</kwd><kwd>plant nutrition</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>XANES</kwd><kwd>XFM</kwd><kwd>zinc</kwd><kwd>ZnEDTA</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Sonic Essentials</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Australian Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000923</named-content></funding-source><award-id>LP130100741</award-id><award-id>FT120100277</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation - Earth Sciences</named-content></funding-source><award-id>EAR - 1634415</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Department of Energy- GeoSciences</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DEFG02-94ER14466</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly half of the world&#x02019;s agricultural soils contain inadequate levels of available zinc (Zn), resulting in Zn deficiency in one-third of the global human population (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alloway, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">International Zinc Association, 2010</xref>). Zn deficiency in humans is particularly problematic for women and children in developing countries (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kumssa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) where the majority of food intake consists of cereal grains (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Prasad, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Zou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In staple food crops such as cereals, low concentrations of Zn are caused not only by low soil concentrations but also by the low bioavailability of Zn in soil (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Alloway, 2008<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>It was recently proposed that the agricultural sector provides the only &#x02018;sustainable solution to Zn deficiency in humans globally&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Soils with low concentrations of available Zn can be improved by adding Zn fertilizers, but this strategy can be ineffective and expensive in highly Zn-fixing soils (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Graham and Rengel, 1993</xref>). Therefore, to avoid these issues, but still increase grain Zn concentrations, foliar Zn application can also be used (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Zou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Prasad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). This method can supplement the nutrient supply, overcoming the problem of low availability of soil nutrients. However, the factors that influence the effectiveness of foliar application are not well understood (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Eichert, 2009</xref>), including how the chemical form in which the nutrient is applied affects its uptake, translocation, and overall efficacy.</p><p>Zinc sulphate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) is the most commonly used inorganic form of soil-applied Zn fertilizer, whereas ZnEDTA is the most commonly used chelated source (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Alloway, 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). In some soils, the availability of chelated Zn is at least double that of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>; however, it is also 5&#x02013;10 times more expensive (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Boawn, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Karak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Alloway, 2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). When ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnEDTA fertilizers are used for foliar application, it is unclear which treatment is more efficacious; results vary depending on what parameter is used to define &#x02018;agricultural efficacy&#x02019;. Some studies have shown that foliar-applied ZnEDTA is more effective than ZnSO<sub>4</sub> for increasing grain yield if applied before the tillering stage (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brennan, 1991</xref>). However, when dry shoot biomass was used as the measure of agricultural effectiveness, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Haslett <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> found a minimal difference between foliar-applied ZnEDTA and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. When comparing the effects of ZnEDTA and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> on Zn grain concentration in different plant species, the results are also inconclusive. For example, in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.), the increase in the grain Zn concentration was significantly higher for ZnSO<sub>4</sub> than for ZnEDTA (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), whereas in chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L.), ZnEDTA resulted in a higher Zn seed content (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>These past studies are difficult to compare directly as each study used different plants species (at different growth stages) under various environmental conditions (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Brown, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the experimental methods that were used&#x02014;total Zn content analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brennan, 1991</xref>), and grain or crop yield (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brennan, 1991</xref>)&#x02014;are not ideally suited to understanding the details of foliar absorption, translocation, and speciation of the different sources of Zn. As a result, the pathways and mechanisms of micronutrient uptake through leaves remain poorly understood, and there is uncertainty regarding the translocation and speciation of nutrients once they penetrate the leaf surface (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez, 2013</xref>). This lack of knowledge limits the refinement of fertilization strategies and the development of more effective formulations.</p><p>This study aims to provide detailed information on the mobility, distribution, and speciation of foliar-applied Zn in wheat using <sup>65</sup>Zn-spiked solutions and state-of-the-art synchrotron techniques.

Shield was used as it is a commercially important cultivar in Australia and is a double haploid wheat variety, making it relatively homogenous. Seeds were germinated for 4 d in 50 ml open-ended plastic cylinders filled with rockwool (a growing substrate to support the seedlings), then covered with black tape, and the cylinders were inserted in pots filled with 760 ml of deionized water.

Each treatment was applied to a separate leaf and there were four replicates per treatment (i.e. four leaves per treatment). Both treatments had a Zn concentration of 1000 mg l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, typical of agricultural Zn foliar sprays (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak and Kutman, 2018</xref>), and were labelled with <sup>65</sup>Zn at a rate of 2 kBq l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. To ensure that the ZnEDTA was properly labelled with the Zn radioisotope, <sup>65</sup>Zn solution was added to the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solution before EDTA was added. Both fertilizer solutions were adjusted to pH 6 using 100 mM NaOH and contained Tween-20 (0.05%, v/v) as a surfactant. Prior to fertilizer treatment, the leaves were marked with a permanent marker 20 mm from the tip. Three days later, the plants were removed from the growing chamber and the leaves were dipped in the fertilizer solutions up to this mark for 30 s. Plants were then immediately returned to the growing chamber. After 24 h, the fertilizer solutions had dried out on the leaf, and the leaf tip was cut from the leaf where it had been marked. The remainder of the leaf was then cut into fragments to detect the movement of applied Zn away from the application area. The first fragment was cut 3 mm from the point of application (i.e. 23 mm from the tip), followed by another nine fragments collected as follows: three fragments at 3 mm, two fragments at 4 mm, and four fragments at 5 mm (10 sections in total).</p><p>The <sup>65</sup>Zn activity of the samples was analysed using gamma spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer 2480 WIZARD<sup>2&#x000ae;</sup> Automatic Gamma Counter).

During this 3 h exposure period, the droplets remained as a liquid and did not dry out. After 3 h, and immediately prior to the first XFM scan, unabsorbed fertilizer was removed from the leaf surface by gently wiping with KimTech wipes and sequentially rinsing with 2% nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), 3% ethanol, and deionized water (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The XFM scans of the sample leaves were collected by mounting the plants, still growing in the tube holding the nutrient solution, on the back of a sample holder and gently bending the appropriate part of the leaves in an area that could be positioned, unimpeded, in the path of the X-ray beam. To mount the samples on the sample holder, leaves were partially covered in Ultralene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> film (4 &#x000b5;m thick).

X-ray fluorescence emitted by the sample (and subsequent elemental maps) was collected using an incident energy of 12 900 eV and a 384-element Maia detector, in backscatter geometry. The sample leaf was analysed continuously horizontally with a sampling interval of 12 &#x003bc;m and a vertical step size of 12 &#x003bc;m. To avoid damaging the sample during XFM scanning, the transit time for each pixel was 3 ms (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Lombi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).

The electron storage ring operated at 7 GeV in top-up mode, with the X-ray source being a 72 pole, 35 mm period undulator. A cooled Si(111) monochromator and Kirkpatrick&#x02013;Baez focusing mirrors were used to obtain a monochromatic beam focused onto the specimen. Elemental maps were collected using an incident energy of 10 500 eV and a 4-element Vortex detector. The sample leaf was mounted at a 45&#x000b0; angle relative to the incident beam and analysed continuously horizontally with a sampling interval of 8 &#x003bc;m and a vertical step size of 8 &#x003bc;m. The transit time for each pixel was 10 ms. The spectra were analysed using GSE MapViewer. Leaves treated with ZnEDTA were not investigated in this experiment.

The beam size was adjusted to ~1.2 &#x000d7; 0.7 (H&#x000d7;V) mm. Sample spectra were collected in fluorescence mode with a 36-element solid-state Ge detector. At the same time, the XANES spectrum of a metallic Zn reference foil was collected in transmission mode and this spectrum was used to energy calibrate the sample spectra. The spectra were energy normalized and background corrected using the Athena software package (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ravel and Newville, 2005</xref>). Linear combination fitting (LCF) of the sample spectra was performed using the Athena software in the fitting range &#x02013;30 eV to +100 eV relative to the Zn K<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-edge.</p><p>Fertilizer droplets were applied to the leaves, sealed in a moistened Petri dish as described in the XFM experiments, and left for 24 h. Again, it was noted that during this 24 h experimental period, the droplets remained as a liquid and did not dry out. Leaves were then washed using the same procedure as for the XFM experiments. The leaf sample was mounted vertically on a Perspex holder with a 13 mm diameter window using two pieces of Kapton tape. When placing the leaf in the sample holder, a small strip of aluminium foil was placed next to the leaf where the droplet had been applied, to pinpoint the fertilizer application area during the scans. The sample was then plunged into liquid nitrogen and rapidly mounted on a cryostat maintained at 10 K using liquid He. The leaf was scanned along the longitudinal axis, using an incident energy above the Zn K<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>-edge (10 040 eV) to obtain a line scan of the Zn distribution. To determine the Zn speciation at different distances from the point of application, XANES spectra were collected at various positions based on the signal intensity. First, the background and maximum Zn signal intensities were determined. The background signal was located between 3 mm and 5 mm from the centre of the line scan, whereas the maximum signal intensity was in the centre of the line scan. XANES maps were collected at these positions, as well as at positions at 10, 25, and 50% of the intensity between these two positions. The total length of the line scans was between 8 mm and 10 mm. Due to the high variation in background Zn concentrations between leaves, a separate untreated leaf is not suitable for quantifying background Zn in treated leaves. However, XFM analysis of an untreated leaf was performed to characterize the distribution of background Zn (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).</p><p>Using the same methods as described above, seven Zn reference materials were also measured at the XAS beamline: Zn-citrate, Zn-phytate, Zn-cysteine, Zn-polygalacturonate, Zn-histidine, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and ZnEDTA. All prepared reference materials had a pH of 6.5 (adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH), and a nominal concentration of 350 mg Zn l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, with the exceptions of Zn-polygalacturonate (180 mg Zn l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnEDTA (500 mg Zn l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>).

These concentrations are based on the average Zn concentration in areas as far from the applied droplet as possible (determined by the size of the scanned area). The concentrations in these areas did not change from 3 h to 24 h, so it is most likely that it is background Zn, and not Zn moving away from the applied droplet. XFM Experiment 1 investigated changes in the distribution of Zn in leaf tissues to which Zn had been applied for 3 h before being removed. Areas of high Zn concentration&#x02014;where Zn treatments were applied to leaves&#x02014; were clearly visible as circular &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; in the XFM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A&#x02013;D</xref>). The XFM data showed that the applied Zn did not cause any physical damage to the leaf (i.e. leaf scorch). Leaf scorch, and the consequent loss of water, reduces the thickness of the leaf, and therefore thinner areas of the leaf would appear as a darker colour in the Compton scattering map. As this was not observed in the leaf tissue under the fertilizer application area, it is unlikely that Zn damaged the leaf.</p><p>The first scan was collected 3 h after applying the droplet (and immediately after removing the unabsorbed Zn from the leaf surface). In this first scan, the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> spot appeared slightly more intense than the ZnEDTA spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting a higher absorption of Zn when applied as ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. However, in the scans collected 12 h and 24 h after fertilizer application (i.e. 9 h and 21 h after the unabsorbed Zn had been removed from the leaf surface) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>, respectively), the &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; for both treatments were of a similar intensity. Veins of the leaves were also visible as parallel lines in XFM images. To support our hypothesis that the measured Zn was internalized and not on the leaf surface, XFM scans of freeze-dried transverse leaf cross-sections were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>While the XFM images were useful for understanding the general distribution of Zn in leaves, visual appearance alone could not give conclusive results regarding the differences in Zn uptake between treatments. Therefore, data were extracted from the XFM images and further analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2E&#x02013;G</xref>). After normalizing these data to compensate for differences in background Zn concentrations, Zn absorption after 3 h was found to be similar between treatments. However, after 12 h and 24 h (i.e. 9 h and 21 h after the unabsorbed Zn had been removed from the leaf surface), Zn applied as ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was slightly more mobile than Zn applied as ZnEDTA based on two observations: (i) more Zn remained at the application point in the ZnEDTA-treated leaf; and (ii) after 12 h and 24 h, the distribution of Zn was broader in the ZnSO<sub>4</sub>-treated leaf compared with the ZnEDTA-treated leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">G</xref>). Therefore, despite the visual similarities between XFM images for both treatments, detailed analysis indicates that Zn applied as ZnEDTA was slightly less mobile than Zn applied as ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. In terms of the rate of Zn movement, Zn from the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment was more mobile between 3 h and 12 h than between 12 h and 24 h after application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figs S3, S4A</xref>). However, for the ZnEDTA treatment, Zn mobility appeared relatively consistent between 3, 12, and 24 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figs S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S4B</xref>).</p><p>In XFM Experiment 2 (performed <italic>in situ</italic> using hydrated, excised leaves), transverse line scans were collected across the leaf (i.e. perpendicular to the central vein; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Peaks in the XFM transect showed that Zn accumulated in veins (transects d&#x02013;h <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Zinc was also observed in the smaller transverse veins interconnecting the main longitudinal cross-veins. Moving away from the application point, the amount of Zn decreased more quickly from the interveinal area than from the veins (circled areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting that Zn was translocated through the veins. The same Zn distribution pattern was observed in a ZnEDTA-treated leaf (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>) collected from Experiment 1, where a high number of counts was detected in the veins of the leaf tissue underneath the droplet application site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref> transects a&#x02013;c), and then a decrease moving away from the application site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref> transects d&#x02013;h).

These differences were determined by comparing (i) the energy of the white-line peak; (ii) the height of the white-line peak; and (iii) spectral features of each standard. The white-line peak corresponded to an energy of 9665 eV for Zn-phosphate, 9667 eV for Zn-phytate, Zn-histidine, Zn-citrate, Zn-EDTA, and Zn-polygalacturonate, and 9668 eV for Zn-cysteine. This shift to higher edge energies can be explained by the higher electronegativity of S (the thiol group in Zn-cysteine) compared with P (Zn-phosphate). Compared with the white-line energies, the heights of the peaks showed more variation between standards. The white-line peak height decreased in the order Zn-citrate &#x0003e;ZnEDTA &#x0003e;Zn-polygalacturonate &#x0003e;Zn-phytate ~ Zn-phosphate &#x0003e;Zn-cysteine ~ Zn-histidine.

Zinc appeared even less mobile in our XFM analyses where tissue Zn concentrations decreased rapidly at &#x0003e;2.5 mm from the edge of the fertilizer droplet for both treatments. This slight difference in mobility may be due to the sensitivities of both the techniques and instruments used for the analyses, and the large Zn background present which makes the XFM method intrinsically less precise. On the other hand, the XFM method used here allowed us to map precisely the diffusion of Zn away from the point of application on the same leaves over time. To our knowledge, this is the first application of time-resolved elemental imaging in plants using this synchrotron technique. The limited mobility of foliar-applied Zn has been attributed to its poor leaf penetration, and high binding capacity of Zn to leaf tissues (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Marschner, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Montalvo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>); the conditional mobility of Zn in the phloem is likely to be less important (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Brown, 2013</xref>)</p><p>Although comparable studies using wheat plants could not be found, our results are in general agreement with previous studies using other plant species that have shown limited mobility of foliar-applied Zn. For example, when Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was applied as a droplet (400 mg l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) to the YFEL of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) plants, Zn concentrations in interveinal tissue decreased to background levels within 1.5&#x02013;3 mm of the edge of the droplet (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Brown (1999)</xref> investigated the distribution of foliar-applied Zn in pistachio (<italic>Pistachio vera</italic> L.) using a stable Zn tracer (<sup>68</sup>Zn in the form of ZnO). At 25 d after sectioning <sup>68</sup>Zn-treated leaves into three parts (apical, middle, and basal), 84% of applied <sup>68</sup>Zn remained in the midsection (where Zn was applied) and only 4% was detected in the apical sections and 13% in the basal sections. Using synchrotron-based XFM, the mobility of foliar-absorbed Zn in the veins of sunflower (<italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>) and tomato was limited to 0.96 &#x000b1; 0.26 mm and 0.88 &#x000b1; 0.13 mm (mean, <italic>n</italic>=4), respectively (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).

Using similar XFM methods to the current study, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref> showed that foliar-applied Zn (200 mg Zn l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) was more mobile in the phloem of sunflower plants when applied with EDTA compared with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> alone. In dwarf pea plants (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic> cv Douce Provence), translocation of Zn away from the treated leaf to other plant parts was similar for both fertilizers, where 4.9% of the Zn from ZnEDTA and 4.7% of the Zn from ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was translocated after 24 h (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Ferrandon and Chamel, 1988</xref>). In the current study, although Zn was relatively immobile in leaf tissue, both experiments showed that ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was slightly more mobile than ZnEDTA, contradicting our original hypothesis that ZnEDTA would have greater mobility.</p><p>Following leaf surface penetration, inorganic nutrients may be transported through apoplastic or symplastic spaces (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Yumei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Based on previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez and Brown, 2013</xref>), we hypothesized that the abundance of negatively charged sites in the apoplast (e.g. cell walls) would limit the translocation of positively charged Zn<sup>2+</sup>, whereas chelated Zn would be &#x02018;protected&#x02019; from sorption. The results did not support this hypothesis, indicating that the adsorption of Zn<sup>2+</sup> at negatively charged sites is not the primary factor controlling Zn mobility in leaves. This is analogous to the uptake and mobility of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in plant roots where the ion is taken up efficiently and does not strongly bind to the cell wall or membrane components (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hart <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Therefore, additional factors are likely to have influenced Zn mobility such as (i) the dominance of other transport pathways (i.e. symplastic transport); (ii) a proportion of Zn may have been rapidly released from the ZnEDTA complex and thus its mobility would follow that of Zn<sup>2+</sup>; or (iii) Zn<sup>2+</sup> may have been complexed and stabilized by other compounds after penetrating the cuticle. Further investigation is required to determine what effect, if any, (i) had on Zn mobility. In the current study, the influence of (ii) and (iii) was investigated using Zn XAS chemical speciation analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Foliar-applied zinc is distributed rapidly in wheat leaves and moves towards the veins</title><p>Although limited, the translocation of Zn occurred quickly for both treatments (&#x0003c;24 h).

It is unknown why this occurred, but both the nutritional status of the plant and the complexation of Zn may have played a role.

Once Zn was taken up by the leaf, a small proportion of Zn may have been relatively mobile and moved quickly from the application site, whereas a larger proportion was bound by various ligands, greatly limiting Zn mobility.

While the uptake of hydrophobic compounds may simply occur through dissolution&#x02013;diffusion processes, hydrophilic moieties (such as ZnEDTA and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) may cross the cuticle where it is damaged, or cross the leaf surface through epidermal structures such as the stomata, trichomes, specialized epidermal cells, or &#x02018;aqueous pores&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Rios <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). While further investigation is required to understand the specific uptake pathway of hydrophilic chelated complexes, the results show that larger hydrophilic compounds such as ZnEDTA can cross the leaf surface.</p><p>At the site of fertilizer application, the speciation of Zn was different from that in the background tissues. Although Zn-phytate, ZnEDTA, and Zn-polygalacturonate were the dominant Zn species in leaves treated with Zn, for background tissues the predominant form was Zn-cysteine (&#x0003e;70%), with lesser amounts of Zn-phytate (&#x02264;32%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). In ZnSO<sub>4</sub>-treated leaves, only a minor proportion was predicted to be present as Zn-cysteine (&#x0003c;14%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) at the application point. Further, in ZnEDTA-treated leaves, Zn-cysteine was not detected at the application point. There are conflicting results regarding the fraction of leaf Zn present as Zn-cysteine. <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Terzano <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> found that ~50% of foliar Zn was associated with cysteine in rocket (<italic>Eruca vesicaria</italic> L. Cavalieri), whereas in cowpea (<italic>Vigna ungui culata</italic> L. Walp) grown in ZnCl<sub>2</sub>-spiked soil, Zn-cysteine was only identified in the nodules and seeds, not in the leaves (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The observations above raise several important points regarding the form in which foliar applied Zn is taken up and its chemical speciation when transported in the leaf away from the application site. As stated above, there was a significant interaction between Zn and phytate in leaves exposed to both Zn treatments and for background Zn. Foliar application of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnEDTA substantially increased the proportion of Zn associated with phytate (45% for ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and 49% for ZnEDTA) compared with that in the control leaves (24%). Phytate is the primary storage form of P in cereals and legumes, comprising 40&#x02013;85% of the total P in seeds and grains (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Reddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Noack <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, little is known about the contribution of phytate to total P in other plant parts under subtoxic conditions. Using <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Noack <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> did not detect any phytate in the leaves of mature wheat plants; orthophosphate (85%) and glycerophosphate (15%) were the most abundant forms of P. In the seed, stems, and chaff, on the other hand, phytate was detected. The stability of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-phytate complex is influenced by pH and the stoichiometry of the complex which in turn is affected by the initial Zn<sup>2+</sup>:phytate ratio (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Crea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In plants and soil, phytic acid can bind with metal ions to form stable insoluble complexes (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Evans, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). There is extensive literature on the bioavailability of P and Zn in soil and plant grains, yet it is uncertain how Zn toxicity affects P conditions, and, conversely, how high P concentrations affect Zn mobility in vegetative plant parts.</p><p>Zinc-polygalacturonate, Zn-citrate, and Zn-cysteine made a minor contribution to the overall speciation of Zn in Zn-treated leaves; however, their presence provides important insights into the fate of foliar-applied Zn. A substantial proportion of Zn was predicted to be associated with polygalacturonic acid in ZnSO<sub>4</sub>-treated leaves (8&#x02013;29%), but only at three of the seven scanned locations in ZnEDTA-treated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Polygalacturonic acid is a major component of pectin (pectic polysaccharides), which is most abundant in plant primary cell walls and the middle lamella (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</xref>). This suggests that when ZnSO<sub>4</sub> is applied to wheat leaves, absorbed Zn<sup>2+</sup> will bind to the negatively charged cell walls, whereas for ZnEDTA this pathway is less important. Homogalacturonan is one of the most abundant pectin biopolymers in cell walls and consists of linear chains of &#x003b1;-1,4-linked <sc>d</sc>-galacturonic acid (GalA) residues (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Ridley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In aqueous solution, it has been shown that Zn<sup>2+</sup> can bind to GalA residues in pectin, and that the lower the degree of esterification in these residues the higher the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding capacity (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Khotimchenko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Away from the point of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> fertilizer application, Zn was predicted to be associated with citrate (23&#x02013;42%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In this study, the citrate ligand can be considered representative of any carboxyl group of an organic acid (e.g. malate or oxalate). At neutral pH, the stability constant for Zn-citrate is higher than that for Zn- malate and Zn-oxalate, but, under acidic conditions, oxalate forms a stronger Zn complex (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the pH of cell vacuoles&#x02014;where organic acids are primarily found (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>)&#x02014;can influence the speciation of intracellular Zn in wheat leaves. The results are in agreement with previous studies which have shown a high proportion of leaf Zn to be associated with citrate in cowpea (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and in the hyperaccumulator Alpine Penny-cress (<italic>Noccaea caerulescens</italic>, formerly <italic>Thlaspi caerulescens</italic>) where large amounts of Zn can be stored with organic acids in the vacuoles of leaf epidermal cells (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;pper <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Frey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Zn-citrate was not a significant component in the LCF of ZnEDTA-treated leaves. This may be attributed to the lower stability constants of Zn-citrate compared with ZnEDTA and/or that substantially less foliar-applied ZnEDTA is stored in and transported to cell vacuoles in wheat.</p><p>The stability of Zn complexes is likely to have had a strong influence on the speciation of Zn in leaf tissues. For example, in ZnEDTA-treated leaves, Zn-cysteine was not predicted to be present at the application site, but its predicted contribution increased to 34% away from this point. It is unclear why this occurred. One possibility is that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is released from the EDTA complex when it is transported in the plant and preferentially binds to cysteine ligands. Alternatively, the proportion of ZnEDTA relative to other Zn chemical species may simply decrease further away from the application point. We believe the latter is the most likely scenario given the high stability constant of ZnEDTA (logK=17.5; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Norvell, 1991</xref>). The high stability of this complex can affect the abundance of other Zn complexes, where those that have a lower stability constant&#x02014;such as Zn-citrate (logK ~5; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Wyrzykowski and Chmurzy&#x00144;ski, 2010</xref>)&#x02014;are less favourable. This may also explain why Zn-citrate was not detected in the ZnEDTA-treated leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This chelation of Zn by organic ligands can act to decrease the transport of Zn in leaf tissue and restrict its translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>High zinc concentrations in foliar sprays may determine zinc chemical speciation</title><p>The concentration of Zn in commercial foliar Zn sprays can be exceptionally high (up to 1500 mg l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>), potentially higher than the rate used in the present experiments (1000 mg Zn l<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). At these concentrations, Zn can cause leaf damage (scorch) under the area where the droplets sit. Therefore, localized toxicity may have occurred in the leaf given that Zn was absorbed relatively quickly and had limited mobility. This hypothesis is supported by the Zn chemical speciation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that when various agronomic plant species are exposed to high Zn concentrations (40&#x02013;300 &#x003bc;M) via the roots, a large proportion of Zn accumulates as Zn-phytate (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">van Steveninck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Kopittke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Both authors suggested that this may be a defence mechanism that acts to limit the transport of high concentrations of Zn to shoots. Therefore, the increased proportion of Zn-phytate observed in ZnEDTA-treated (39&#x02013;50%) and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>-treated leaves (37&#x02013;64%) compared with the control leaves (12&#x02013; 32%) may be an important Zn detoxification mechanism where complexation with phytate decreases the mobility and bioavailability of Zn in leaves. Also supporting this hypothesis is the presence of Zn-phosphate (21%) at the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> application point (where the highest concentration of Zn was observed). It has been suggested that this chemical species is important for the detoxification of high concentrations of Zn in plants. For example, in the leaves of rocket grown in Zn-contaminated soil, ~50% of Zn was predicted to be present as Zn-phosphate (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Terzano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, in the current study, plant toxicity defence mechanisms may have had a major influence, and possibly been the key determinant of, Zn chemical speciation in leaves.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated the limited mobility of Zn in wheat leaves when applied as ZnEDTA and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> foliar fertilizers. By using <sup>65</sup>Zn radiolabelled foliar treatments, we were able to detect subtle differences in the mobility of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnEDTA, where ZnSO<sub>4</sub> was slightly more mobile in leaves. Synchrotron-based XAS analyses were used to determine the transformation and subsequent speciation of foliar-applied Zn. The ZnEDTA complex was taken up in chelated form and transported in this form most probably due to the high stability of this complex compared with organic acids. High concentrations of Zn in foliar fertilizers are likely to affect Zn chemical speciation and mobility strongly due to localized Zn toxicity in the plant leaf. Therefore, Zn foliar fertilizers with slower release rates may be advantageous as they could act to reduce toxicity on a local scale, thereby limiting the subsequent detoxification mechanisms that decrease Zn bioavailability. This study focused on the immediate uptake and behaviour of foliar-applied Zn; longer term plant studies are recommended to understand how Zn speciation affects the agronomic effectiveness of ZnEDTA and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> foliar fertilizers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s18"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Protocol S1.
