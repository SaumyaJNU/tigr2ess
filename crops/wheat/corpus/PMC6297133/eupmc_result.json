    "Biodiversity is well known to enhance many ecosystem functions, but empirical evidence for the role of soil biodiversity for plant biomass production and allocation is scarce. Here we studied the effects of animal decomposer diversity (1, 2, and 4 species as well as a control without any decomposers) on the biomass production and aboveground-belowground biomass allocation of common wheat using two earthworm and two Collembola species using an additive design in two soil management types (organic and mineral fertilizer treatments) in a microcosm experiment. Shoot (+11%), spike (+7%), and root biomass (+56%), increased significantly with increasing decomposer diversity, and these effects were consistent across the two soil management types. Notably, decomposer diversity effects were stronger on root than on shoot biomass, significantly decreasing the shoot-to-root ratio (-27%). Increased plant biomass production was positively correlated with a decomposer richness-induced increase in soil water nitrate concentrations five weeks after the start of the experiment. However, elevated soil nitrate concentrations did not cause significantly higher plant tissue nitrogen concentrations and nitrogen amounts, suggesting that additional mechanisms might be at play. Consistent decomposer diversity effects across soil management types indicate that maintaining soil biodiversity is a robust and sustainable strategy to enhance crop yield."
