    "Conservative agriculture includes a range of management strategies with low energy inputs such as no-tillage, minimum tillage, and low application of fertilizers. Weed flora in arable fields is strictly affected by agronomic practices such as tillage and fertilization management. This study was conducted seven years after the beginning of a long-term-durum wheat‚Åªfaba bean-rotation. It analyzes the combined effects on the soil seed bank of three different tillage systems (conservative, reduced, and conventional tillage) and two levels of nitrogen fertilization. The effects were investigated both using stepwise discriminant analysis and analysis of variance in order to find statistical differences among main factors and their interactions. The seed bank of Conyza canadensis, Papaver rhoeas, Solanum nigrum, Fallopia convolvulus, and Fumaria officinalis was higher in conservative or reduced tillage plots. The magnitude of the response to nitrogen supply varied among weed species. Conyza canadensis seemed to be favored by low nitrogen supply, whereas Sinapis arvensis by higher doses of nitrogen. Anagallis arvensis showed the lowest seed bank in conventionally tilled plots, without distinction of nitrogen supply. The results suggest that different tillage systems and, to a lesser extent, different nitrogen supply, produce changes in the seed bank size and composition, along the soil profile."
