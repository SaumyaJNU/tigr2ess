This study assessed tolerance to 14-days of early- or late-stage waterlogging of the major winter crops wheat, barley, rapeseed and field pea. Aerenchyma formation in adventitious roots, leaf physiological parameters (net photosynthesis, stomatal and mesophyll conductances, chlorophyll fluorescence), shoot and root growth during and after waterlogging, and seed production were evaluated. Wheat produced adventitious roots with 20&#x02013;22% of aerenchyma, photosynthesis was maintained during waterlogging, and seed production was 86 and 71% of controls for early- and late-waterlogging events. In barley and rapeseed, plants were less affected by early- than by late-waterlogging. Barley adventitious roots contained 19% aerenchyma, whereas rapeseed did not form aerenchyma. In barley, photosynthesis was reduced during early-waterlogging mainly by stomatal limitations, and by non-stomatal constraints (lower mesophyll conductance and damage to photosynthetic apparatus as revealed by chlorophyll fluorescence) during late-waterlogging. In rapeseed, photosynthesis was mostly reduced by non-stomatal limitations during early- and late-waterlogging, which also impacted shoot and root growth. Early-waterlogged plants of both barley and rapeseed were able to recover in growth upon drainage, and seed production reached <italic>ca</italic>. 79&#x02013;85% of the controls, while late-waterlogged plants only attained 26&#x02013;32% in seed production. Field pea showed no ability to develop root aerenchyma when waterlogged, and its photosynthesis (and stomatal and mesophyll conductances) was rapidly decreased by the stress. Consequently, waterlogging drastically reduced field pea seed production to 6% of controls both at early- and late-stages with plants being unable to resume growth upon drainage. In conclusion, wheat generates a set of adaptive responses to withstand 14 days of waterlogging, barley and rapeseed can still produce significant yield if transiently waterlogged during early plant stages but are more adversely impacted at the late stage, and field pea is not suitable for areas prone to waterlogging events of 14 days at either growth stage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>waterlogging</kwd><kwd>crops</kwd><kwd>aerenchyma</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>yield</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="67"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last decades, the number of waterlogging episodes on croplands has increased worldwide, mainly due to more intense and unpredictable rainfalls associated with climate change (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hirabayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Core Writing Team et al., 2014</xref>). In turn, soils with significant content of clay or intensely compacted by the repeated use of agricultural machinery can experience poor drainage, also entailing an increase in waterlogging occurrence (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 2004</xref>). Waterlogging impacts around 16% of soils in United States, affecting also irrigated areas of India, China, and Pakistan (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the occurrence of flash floods is expected to increase in Europe due to an intensified hydrological cycle by global warming (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Feyen et al., 2012</xref>). In the Argentine Pampas, a vast plain of around 50 Mha, about 31% of the area has suffered recurrently from waterlogging events since 2002 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kuppel et al., 2015</xref>). To illustrate economic losses associated with waterlogging or floods, in the United States the lost crop production was around $360 million per year during 2010&#x02013;2016, and was even a greater loss than caused by drought in three out of the 7 years (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2017</xref>). So, soil waterlogging is a major abiotic stress of increasing importance, and it causes significant yield losses of various crops. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how crop plants respond to waterlogging to identify traits contributing to tolerance.</p><p>Wheat and barley are the most substantial cool-season cereals in the world, each having an annual production, respectively, of up to 749 and 141 million tons <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">FAOSTAT, 2016</xref>. Rapeseed is the second largest oil-seed crop after soybean, presenting a production of 68 million ton <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">FAOSTAT, 2016</xref>, providing oil with a high level of omega-9 (oleic fatty acid), one of the healthiest oils (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 1991</xref>). Field pea is an important cool season grain legume, with about 14 million ton of dry peas produced each year <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">FAOSTAT, 2016</xref>. Each of these four species can suffer yield losses resulting from waterlogging (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Siddique et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Lin, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Setter and Waters, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2004</xref>). Depending on the waterlogging duration, soil type and genotypes, reductions in yield range from 15 to 25% in wheat and barley (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Setter and Waters, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2016</xref>), 30&#x02013;45% in rapeseed (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez Boem et al., 1996</xref>), and 50&#x02013;90% in field pea (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cannell et al., 1979</xref>).</p><p>Soil waterlogging imposes a considerable slow-down of the oxygen exchange between soil and roots, as gas diffusion rates are 10,000 times slower in water than in air (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 1979</xref>). Consequently, waterlogged soils can quickly become anoxic at depths greater than a few centimeters, as the oxygen demand by roots and soil microorganisms&#x02019; respiration largely exceeds the influx from the atmosphere (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Visser and Voesenek, 2005</xref>). Such lack of oxygen is rapidly reflected as a drop in the soil redox potential (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Ponnamperuma, 1972</xref>). Plants react to soil oxygen deprivation through a series of anatomical, morphological and physiological responses to mitigate the effects of soil anoxia. Soon after waterlogging, root metabolism shifts from aerobic respiration to the less efficient fermentation to produce energy, leading to a reduction in ATP production (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs and Greenway, 2003</xref>). The energy deficit at root level results in a lack of phosphorylation of aquaporins, a reaction necessary to allow these proteins to regulate cell water flux, so root hydraulic conductivity is severely reduced (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Some species have the capacity to grow adventitious roots with aerenchyma, facilitating the diffusion of oxygen from the shoot into and along the roots, which allows cells to continue respiration and water and nutrient uptake (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Justin and Armstrong, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Colmer, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Striker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Colmer and Greenway, 2011</xref>). The species studied present variable ability to generate adventitious roots with aerenchyma and thus a high gas-filled volume (porosity); root porosity in wheat can reach values of 19&#x02013;30% (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1994</xref>) and in barley 7&#x02013;23% (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2004</xref>), whereas roots of rapeseed (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Voesenek et al., 1999</xref>) and of field pea (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Healy and Armstrong, 1972</xref>) did not develop aerenchyma when in an oxygen deficient medium.</p><p>The impaired root functioning under waterlogging impacts the physiological responses of the shoots, particularly the carbon fixation. Waterlogging-induced partial stomatal closure could constrain internal CO<sub>2</sub> levels and limit carbon fixation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Striker et al., 2005</xref>), but this variable has rarely been quantified (e.g., in wheat, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; in rapeseed, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Leul and Zhou, 1998</xref>). Apart from stomatal limitations, photosynthesis rates can also be determined by non-stomatal factors, such as mesophyll conductance (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Flexas and Medrano, 2002</xref>), damage to photosystem II (PSII) caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf, 2012</xref>), and leaf chlorosis related to chlorophyll degradation due to an accelerated leaf senescence (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;rtensteiner, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Araki et al., 2012</xref>). Although there are reports regarding the impact of waterlogging on carbon fixation of the winter crops in this study (e.g., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1994</xref> for wheat; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2004</xref> for barley; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Leul and Zhou, 1998</xref> for rapeseed, and <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 2015</xref> for field pea), comparisons between these species are scarce (see <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2017</xref> for wheat and barley).</p><p>Low photosynthesis rates can be a constraint to shoot and root growth, and ultimately reduce seed production (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sinclair and Horie, 1989</xref>). Only some studies have analyzed the impact of waterlogging throughout the entire plant life-cycle, describing responses in vegetative growth and seed production. As examples: in wheat, 20 days of waterlogging on 3&#x02013;4 leaf-stage plants resulted in a final dry mass and yield representing 95 and 90% of controls, respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Collaku and Harrison, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pampana et al., 2016a</xref>); in barley, plants attained 85 and 90% of controls in dry mass and yield when waterlogged for 20 days at 3&#x02013;4 leaf-stage (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Masoni et al., 2016</xref>); in rapeseed, 21 days of soil hypoxia, applied to 5-leaf stage plants, constrained growth as the stressed individuals attained 77% in dry mass and 73% in yield compared to the control (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Leul and Zhou, 1998</xref>); in field pea, 5 days of waterlogging had a substantial impact on plant dry mass accumulation and seed production as, respectively, stressed plants attained 35&#x02013;50% and 5&#x02013;25% of controls (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Pampana et al., 2016b</xref>). Nevertheless, information on root and shoot growth rates during waterlogging and subsequent recovery is scarce, and studies to functionally link leaf physiological responses with growth (i.e., RGR) and seed production (but see <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref> for wheat are few). In addition, waterlogging can affect plants differently depending on the growth stage (e.g., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2014</xref> for wheat and barley; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez Boem et al., 1996</xref> for rapeseed; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Belford et al., 1980</xref> for field pea). <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al. (2014)</xref> found that seed production is more compromised in wheat and barley when waterlogged at late stages (e.g., around flowering) as compared with earlier stages, which probably relates to the importance of photoassimilate supply during these stages. A rise in temperatures and air vapor pressure deficit (VPD<sub>air</sub>) during the later stages (i.e., mid-late spring) as compared to earlier ones (i.e., late winter to early spring), could also exacerbate the effects of waterlogging.</p><p>This study evaluated the tolerances to waterlogging in four widely used winter crops: wheat, barley, rapeseed and field pea. Plants of these species were exposed to a 14-day waterlogging period imposed at an &#x02018;early&#x02019; or a &#x02018;late&#x02019; plant stage. In addition, to shed light on the factors limiting growth, a suite of parameters that influence carbon fixation, such as stomatal and mesophyll conductances, leaf greenness and damage to PSII, along with internal CO<sub>2</sub> were examined. These parameters, as well as root aerenchyma and growth, were measured not only during the waterlogging periods but also after, so that plant recovery was also assessed to maturity, as well as the resulting seed production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Site and Plant Material</title><p>The experiment was carried out at the School of Agriculture, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina (34&#x000b0; 35&#x02032; S, 58&#x000b0; 29&#x02032; W), under outdoor conditions during July to November of 2016 [VPD<sub>air</sub>, maximum (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) and minimum (<italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>) air temperature and photoperiod in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>].

The bottom end of each PVC tube was fitted with a fine mesh which retained the soil but allowed water drainage (or entry during waterlogging, see below). Tubes were placed in 1 m side plastic cubical containers, which had a valve located at the bottom (so waterlogging and drainage could be regulated). Each tube was filled with a mixture (3:1) of sand and silty clay loam soil (Typic Argiudoll). 60 tubes were used per species (240 tubes in total). Three seeds per tube were sown, and after 1 week, seedlings were thinned to one per tube. Before sowing, field pea seeds were inoculated with <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> biovar <italic>viceae</italic> (Signum, Rizobacter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and sprayed with fungicide [Maxim XL, Syngenta<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Mefenoxam+fludioxonil)] as a common agronomic practice. Fertilizer applications are described below. Tubes were kept free of weeds by hand removal and any diseases and insect pests were controlled as required, by applying fungicides [Reflect Xtra, Syngenta<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (isopyrazam+azoxystrobin) for wheat and barley; Orquesta, BASF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (fluxapyroxad+epoxiconazole+pyraclostrobin) for field pea, and K Mamboret&#x000e1;<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (captan) for rapeseed, at 50 and 80 days after sowing (DAS)] and insecticides [D Mamboret&#x000e1;<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (dimethoate) for wheat, barley and rapeseed at 55 and 104 DAS].</p><p>Three treatments were applied to plants: (i) well-drained controls watered daily and allowed to drain freely, (ii) waterlogged at an &#x02018;early&#x02019; stage and (iii) waterlogged at a &#x02018;late&#x02019; stage. Early-waterlogging, which coincided with the vegetative stage, was imposed at 65 DAS. Containers with their valves closed were filled with tap water for 14 days to reach 1&#x02013;2 cm of water above the soil level of the tubes. After the waterlogging period ended, valves were opened so that the water drained and from then onwards, plants were watered daily to field capacity until the end of the experiment, to assess their recovery. Late-waterlogging, which occurred during plant reproductive stages (85 DAS for wheat, barley and rapeseed; 87 DAS for field pea), also lasted 14 days, and again recovery post-waterlogging was also monitored. In both waterlogging treatments, the purpose of having all species waterlogged at the same time was to have reliable comparisons among them, as differences in the environmental conditions [e.g., temperature and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD<sub>air</sub>)] if waterlogged at different moments could differentially impact on plant responses to waterlogging (e.g., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grassini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Fertilizer (Nitrofull Emerger<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Argentina: 12% N, 5% P, 15% K, 2% Mg, 8% S, 3% Ca, 0.02% Zn, 0.2% Fe, 0.02% Mn and 0.015% Bo; % are by weight) was applied to the substrate of all tubes, distributed in three doses of 0.7 g each (2.1 g total per tube). This total amount per tube was based on providing N at a level equivalent to 200 kg per ha (typical dose used under field conditions). In all treatments, the first dose was added 58 DAS (1 week before early-waterlogging), the second dose was applied at 80 DAS (to coincide with 1 day after early waterlogging period ended), and the third dose was applied 102 DAS (to coincide with the start of recovery period after the late waterlogging). The split-application was aimed at reducing potential effects of any nutrient leaching from the tubes either by watering or by waterlogging and subsequent drainage.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Environmental Growing Conditions</title><p>Air temperature and relative humidity were monitored with an automatic meteorological station (Davis Vantage Pro2, CA, United States) at the site of the experiment.

Although root growth was 13% of controls during late-waterlogging, shoot RGR presented no differences compared to controls; and during recovery root and shoot RGR attained 63 and 59% of controls, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I,M</xref>).</p><p>In barley, early-waterlogging induced changes in leaf physiology, such as <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> reduced to 38% of controls from 1 week of waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), followed by <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> lessened to 73% of controls by the end of the stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>); however, there were no changes either in <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> or <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub>. <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> was reduced to 58% of controls 1 week after waterlogging was imposed, likely due to stomatal limitations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Waterlogged plants showed a trend toward low SPAD values in adult and young leaves during the stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,F</xref>). Shoot growth was not affected but root RGR was reduced to 33% of controls due to early-waterlogging. Afterwards, during the recovery, barley showed an important ability to restore its <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub>, and SPAD values, along with a full recovery of <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> (similar to controls) in only 1 week after removing the stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,F,N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,F</xref>). In line with this, a 5.7-fold higher root RGR during the 79&#x02013;99 DAS recovery period was observed concerning controls, and subsequently, shoot RGR was 53% higher than controls during the 99&#x02013;130 DAS period (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,F</xref>).</p><p>Late-waterlogging resulted in more adverse effects on the physiology and growth of barley, compared to early-waterlogging. Firstly, a decrease in <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> (values attained 27% of controls) occurred 5 days after waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), and then <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> had a drastic reduction 1 week after waterlogging started, attaining 9% of controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). In addition, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> dropped by 77% of controls at the end of the stress, indicating damage to PSII (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), which concurred with a 5.7-fold raise in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> by the end of waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>). In line with these responses, plants showed reductions in <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> 5 days after waterlogging was imposed (55&#x02013;15% of controls) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A progressive fall in SPAD of adult leaves occurred 1 week after waterlogging until reaching minimum values (3.7&#x02013;6.3 SPAD units) at the end of the stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Such poor physiological performance during the stress was in turn related to a negative root RGR due to root mortality (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4N</xref>). During the recovery, <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> of previously waterlogged plants could not reach control values (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F,J</xref>), although <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> was fully restored a few days after the stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>). Adult leaves continued with very low SPAD values (i.e., senescing leaves) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Despite <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> was restored during recovery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> values could not be re-established up to control levels until 1 week before maturity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). So, plants were not able to resume root growth (RGR was still negative) and shoot RGR was close to zero, both symptoms of an approaching end of the plant life-cycle (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J,N</xref>).</p><p>Rapeseed showed important changes in leaf physiology due to early-waterlogging, as <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> was drastically reduced during the stress period, reaching values close to zero from 1 week after waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). A reduction in <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> occurred 3 days after waterlogging, to continue dropping until reaching minimum values 1 week after the beginning of the stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). Simultaneously, early-waterlogged plants presented <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> values 63% of controls, indicating PSII damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), followed by a rise of 2.1-fold higher than controls in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O</xref>). At the same time, <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> was progressively reduced during waterlogging until reaching values close to zero. Early-waterlogged plants showed a drastic reduction in SPAD values on adult leaves, indicating early leaf senescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and most of the leaves dropped off by the end of the stress. Waterlogging had a drastic impact on root growth also, as root RGR was negative, caused mainly by tissue death during waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). However, during recovery, rapeseed showed great ability to sprout buds (i.e., branching) soon after the stress was removed, allowing re-establishing growth from new leaves. Two weeks after waterlogging removal, <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> of these new leaves exhibited a peak, reaching higher values than controls (125 and 212% of controls, respectively), to later remain similar to controls until maturity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G,K</xref>). <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> of these new leaves showed similar values than controls since waterlogging was removed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), while SPAD values were 43% higher than those of controls, a pattern that persisted until maturity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This recovery allowed reaching <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> values 28% higher than controls 2 weeks after waterlogging, remaining similar to controls onwards (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). During the 79&#x02013;99 DAS recovery period, root RGR was 3.6-fold higher compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) while shoot RGR was 65% of controls. Later, during 99&#x02013;130 DAS, shoot RGR in recovered plants was 79% higher than the controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>).</p><p>As in early-waterlogging, rapeseed plants exposed to waterlogging at late-stage showed important differences in leaf physiological performance and growth during the stress. Reductions in <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> occurred 5 days after the stress was imposed, reaching values close to zero by 1 week of waterlogging (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G,K</xref>). Additionally, significant differences for leaf greenness were observed, not only in adult leaves but also in younger ones (65 and 37% of controls, respectively) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,G</xref>). Anticipated leaf senescence was followed by abscission both in young and adult leaves (abscised leaves were included in the quantification of shoot dry mass). In addition, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> values stood around 65% of controls throughout late-waterlogging indicating damage to the PSII (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), in coincidence with higher <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> values showing a peak at the end of waterlogging (2.2-fold higher) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O</xref>). Drastic reductions in <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> were observed, showing values close to zero 1 week after waterlogging was imposed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Such a poor performance during waterlogging was evidenced by a negative root RGR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4O</xref>). After water was removed, plants showed partial capacity to recover from the stress due to bud sprouting; <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> of new leaves attained 55% and similar values of controls, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G,K</xref>). Additionally, after 1 week of recovery, leaf greenness of the newly produced leaves reached higher values than controls (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,G</xref>). Also, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> values were restored (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) and <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> attained 67% of controls near maturity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, as the time to recover from the late-waterlogging (late-stage) was shorter than for the early-stage, the recovery was lower. Shoot RGR represented 56% of controls while root RGR was low and similar between treatments in line with the end of the plants life-cycle (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K,O</xref>).</p><p>In field pea, early-waterlogging severely affected leaf physiology and growth. Values close to zero were observed in <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> 1 week after waterlogging started, along with a similar pattern in <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H,L</xref>). A progressive decline in SPAD of adult leaves was observed 1 week after waterlogging was applied, joined by decreases in SPAD of young leaves at the end of the stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,H</xref>). <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> declined to 49% of controls (i.e., damage to PSII), and a rise in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> occurred at the same time (twofold higher compared to controls) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) matching the near to zero values for <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Field pea had not only its root RGR affected, but also its shoot RGR reduced during early-waterlogging (<italic>ca.</italic> 38% of controls) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,H</xref>). During the recovery, field pea was not able to restore leaf functioning (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,H,L,P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,H</xref>). Root RGR continued showing negative values throughout the experiment, and shoot RGR was even more reduced with respect to controls during the recovery than along the waterlogging period (5% of controls in 79&#x02013;101 DAS) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,H</xref>).</p><p>Field pea plants subjected to late-waterlogging behaved in a similar way to those exposed to this stress at the early-stage. Plants presented an abrupt fall in physiological performance soon after the stress was imposed, reaching values close to zero in <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> in only 3 days after the stress was imposed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H,L</xref>). A drastic reduction in <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> occurred 1 week after waterlogging (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), as well as a rise in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1P</xref>) and negligible values of <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Additionally, SPAD values from both adult and young leaves were progressively reduced (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,H</xref>) indicating early leaf senescence in waterlogged plants. Consequently, shoot RGR decreased during the stress (78% of controls) and plants presented negative root RGR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L,P</xref>). Soon after waterlogging was removed, plants were not able to recover as revealed by the negative shoot and root RGR values (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L,P</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Root Aerenchyma Formation Under Waterlogging Differed Among Species</title><p>Aerenchyma formation in adventitious roots in response to waterlogging depended on the species (&#x02018;species &#x000d7; treatment&#x02019; interaction in Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

In wheat, aerenchyma occupied 20% of the root cross sections in early-waterlogged plants and 22% in late-waterlogged plants, being comparable with 19&#x02013;30% aerenchyma in adventitious roots of wheat when waterlogged for 17 days commencing at the 3-leaf stage (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1994</xref>), and concurring with the range of values summarized by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al. (2016)</xref>. In barley, root aerenchyma of waterlogged plants was slightly lower than in wheat (19 and 13%, for early- and late-waterlogging) but in line with those reported in previous works (e.g., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of substantial root aerenchyma is known to facilitate tissue aeration (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong, 1979</xref>), thereby it could be related to a lessened impact of root-zone hypoxia on plants&#x02019; physiological performance <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Colmer and Greenway, 2011</xref>), as for wheat and barley in the present study.</p><p>Rapeseed and field pea did not form aerenchyma in adventitious roots under any growing condition. The inability of rapeseed to generate aerenchyma concurs with one earlier study on seedlings in which the short adventitious roots formed when grown in agar had very low gas-filled porosity (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Voesenek et al., 1999</xref>). For field pea, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Healy and Armstrong (1972)</xref> suggested that this species is not able (or has a minimal capacity) to form aerenchyma in roots, as we also observed. The lack of aerenchyma in the adventitious roots of both rapeseed and field pea would likely explain the greater impact of waterlogging on their physiological and growth performance as compared with barley and wheat.</p></sec><sec><title>Waterlogging Impacts on Carbon Fixation Differentially Among Winter Crops Through Stomatal and Non-stomatal Limitations</title><p>Wheat presented no differences compared to controls in its leaf physiological parameters during early- and late-waterlogging. So, photosynthesis, stomatal and mesophyll conductances, as well as chlorophyll fluorescence were not affected by 14 days of waterlogging. These results concur with those reported by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al. (2017)</xref> for 45-day-old plants subjected to 15 days of waterlogging where no differences in photosynthesis were found at the end of the stress. However, other authors have observed reductions in photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of 85 and 80%, respectively, in 21-day-old plants after 14 days of waterlogging, successfully reestablishing values to controls after a 14-day-recovery (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, despite the similar physiological performances for early- and late-waterlogged plants of wheat and controls in the present study, a recent review by <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al. (2016)</xref> indicated variability in the responses of wheat to waterlogging in their analysis of experiments that involved 23 different cultivars exposed to a range of waterlogging treatments from 7 to 34 days (data were from 15 separate studies), showing a wide range in photosynthesis reductions from 7 to 85% of controls.</p><p>Barley showed reductions in photosynthesis (58% of controls) during early-waterlogging attributed to stomatal limitations, as revealed by a lower <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> (43% of controls) along with falls in internal CO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub>; 72% of controls). Partial closing of stomata during waterlogging for barley was also found by <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al. (2004)</xref>, where <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> followed a similar pattern to that of photosynthesis in 4-leaf stage plants waterlogged for 21 days. Nevertheless, no data on <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> of waterlogged plants for barley were available to match with <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub>, so this study demonstrates that stomata closing can indeed constrain the <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> available for photosynthesis during early-waterlogging in barley. In line with our results where no damage to PSII (i.e., low <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub>) was detected during waterlogging, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al. (2013)</xref> reported only a slight decrease in <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> (<italic>ca</italic>. 10%) in 1-leaf stage seedlings of barley waterlogged for 14 days. Regarding to recovery, a study by <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al. (2004)</xref> showed a successful recovery for 5 out of 6 genotypes analyzed 1 week after water subsided; which agrees with plants fully reestablishing <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> after a 3-day-recovery in our work. During late-waterlogging, photosynthesis of waterlogged barley was further reduced down to values representing only 25% of controls. This was firstly caused by partial stomatal closure (<italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> 32% of controls) that resulted in a lower <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> (71% of controls). After 1 week of waterlogging, non-stomatal constraints to photosynthesis were also evident, such as reduced <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> along with damage to the PSII (drops in <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub>), which derived in a rise in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> (3.2-fold of controls) by the end of waterlogging. Damage to PSII in waterlogged barley plants resulting in decreased rates of <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> were also registered by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al. (2007)</xref>. Regarding recovery, physiological variables were fully restored 2 weeks after water had drained from the soil, near maturity, which suggests that barley is able to recover the leaf physiological functioning even at advanced plant stages.</p><p>In rapeseed, waterlogging had a substantial impact on leaf physiological parameters during the early-stage. <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> reached values close to zero after 1 week of waterlogging, mainly related to non-stomatal factors, such as highly diminished <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> and lower <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> (56% of controls), which led to an increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> values up to 1.9-fold of controls. Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction in carbon fixation was not related to the lack of internal CO<sub>2</sub> as substrate but associated with a damaged photosynthetic apparatus. High sensitivity to waterlogging exhibited by rapeseed was also found in 5-leaf stage plants waterlogged for 3 weeks, showing lower <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> and increased <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Leul and Zhou, 1998</xref>). All physiological parameters were fully restored in the new developed leaves when assessed 10 days after water subsided. These new leaves were the result of the ability of plants to produce new branches, as already reported for plants of rapeseed (cv. Avatar) after being waterlogged for 14 days at stem elongation stage (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Wollmer et al., 2018</xref>). Late-waterlogging had a greater impact over physiology, since plants not only showed <italic>P</italic><sub>n</sub> values close to zero but also exhibited generalized senescence as even young leaves had low greenness. Afterwards, although generation of new leaves through branching was observed with 1 week of recovery, these leaves were not able to reach control values for the measured physiological variables.</p><p>Field pea exhibited a leaf physiological performance severely affected by waterlogging at both growth stages, typical of waterlogging-sensitive species. One week after waterlogging, a fall in <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> was observed, and photosynthesis reached values close to zero, being the latter caused more likely by non-stomatal constraints characterized by a diminished <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> followed by an increase of <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub>. In addition, damage to PSII was evident, reflecting another constraint for carbon fixation <italic>per se</italic>; as well as clear symptoms of chlorophyll degradation due to lower SPAD values in both adult and young leaves, as compared to controls. Previous reports showed that <italic>g</italic><sub>s</sub> resulted in being a variable very sensitive to waterlogging for field pea, given the fact that 9-leaf-stage plants after 4 days of waterlogging showed values of 26 and 52% of controls for adult and young leaves, respectively (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 1979</xref>). Nevertheless, this study indicates that stomatal closure seems not to be the primary constraint for photosynthesis as <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> values increased in comparison to controls. The increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>i</sub> appears to be related to the damage to PSII and potentially in the activity of Rubisco as suggested by the low <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> along with highly reduced <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub>. In line with this high sensitivity to waterlogging, for both early- and late-waterlogging, there was irreversible damage to leaf physiology as none of the variables were restored during recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>The Effect of Waterlogging on Plant Growth and Seed Production Is Determined by Species and Growth Stage</title><p>Wheat showed similar performance to controls in shoot and root growth during early-waterlogging and its recovery. During late-waterlogging, only root RGR was affected. However, despite that growth inhibition when waterlogged, root RGR increased during recovery until reaching 63% of the controls, and indicating ability of wheat for root growth resumption after the stress. Similar to our results, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Malik et al. (2001)</xref> found a substantial decline in root growth due to 14 days of waterlogging on 21-day-old wheat plants (root RGR 26% of controls), but also a subsequent root growth recovery after water drainage. Seed production per plant varied between waterlogging treatments (as in <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2014</xref>), being 86 and 71% of controls for early- and late-waterlogged plants, respectively. Lesser yield losses in wheat (near 92% of controls) were reported in <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2011)</xref>, probably because of a shorter waterlogging (6 days) divided in three periods of 2 days each, at 7- and 9-leaf stage, and also in heading (i.e., spikes appearance). Nevertheless, the tolerance to waterlogging regarding seed production depends on the combination of environmental conditions and considered genotypes, apart from growth stage and duration of waterlogging (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2016</xref>). As examples, 14-day-waterlogged plants of wheat at 22 days after sowing (cv. Wyalkatchem) showed reductions in seed weight per plant to 32% of controls (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>); while 15 days of waterlogging during flowering (cv. Karasu-90) carried reductions to 62% of controls in seed production (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Olgun et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In barley, shoot RGR was unaffected during and after early-waterlogging, and although root growth was negatively impacted by waterlogging, such plants showed 7-fold greater root RGR than controls during recovery. Enhancement in root growth after water subsided was probably supported initially by consumption of carbon reserves (as seen by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2017</xref> for 20-day-waterlogged plants), and subsequently aided by current assimilation after leaf physiological parameters were restored during the 2nd week of recovery. Late-waterlogging severely affected growth as root RGR was negative (denoting tissue mortality) during and after waterlogging, and shoot RGR values were close to zero during recovery. Related to the latter, greenness of adult leaves was significantly lower in waterlogged plants, leading to a detrimental carbon fixation performance at the plant level, and contributing to (partially) explain such a poorer growth. Chlorosis of basal leaves of 1/2-week-old barley waterlogged for 14 days could be associated with nitrogen remobilisation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2013</xref>). The impact on seed production was higher in late- than in early-waterlogging, attaining values of 32 and 85% of controls, probably because early-waterlogging allowed for an effective recovery of physiological and growth parameters by the time of the critical period for yield determination. Contrasting timing of waterlogging during the life-cycle can be a determining factor for barley yield, as also reported that waterlogging during tillering (25&#x02013;45 days after emergence) caused 25% reduction in final seed mass while in pre-flowering (65&#x02013;85 days after emergence) led to a 75% reduction of seed mass (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">de San Celedonio et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Through the early-waterlogging period rapeseed showed positive shoot RGR but presented negative root RGR. Hypoxia-induced root mortality during waterlogging along with consumption of taproot reserves and low carbon fixation at plant level due to leaf senescence (i.e., adult leaves turned purple and then senescent, see also <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez Boem et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Wollmer et al., 2018</xref>) would constrain root growth during the stress period. Importantly, root RGR exhibited 3.6-fold greater values compared to controls during recovery in coincidence with the restoration of the leaf physiological activity after the rapid sprouting of new leaves during the recovery. Concerning late-waterlogging, plants showed negative root RGR (i.e., root mortality) along with shoot RGR of 88% of controls during waterlogging, concurring with findings for 53-day-old rapeseed waterlogged for 14 days (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gutierrez Boem et al., 1996</xref>). During recovery, root growth was almost zero and shoot RGR was only 44% of controls. As an expected consequence of the adverse effects of waterlogging on leaf physiology and growth, seed production was reduced but varied according to the growth stage at which waterlogging occurred; early-waterlogged plants attained 79% of the seed mass of controls, while the ones waterlogged at the late-stage showed values of 27% of controls. As in barley, leaf physiology and growth in early-waterlogged rapeseed might have been restored by the time yield definition occurred, so seed production was substantially less affected compared with late-waterlogging. Observations by <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Wollmer et al. (2018)</xref> also found that the sensitivity of rapeseed to 14-day-waterlogging varied according to plants&#x02019; growth stage when waterlogged; as the stress applied at stem elongation led to a seed mass 75% of controls, while waterlogging at floral bud appearance caused a seed production of 85% of controls.</p><p>Field pea waterlogged at early- and late-stages showed lower shoot RGR than controls, not only during the stress, but also after water subsided. During recovery, previously late-waterlogged plants presented negative shoot RGR, denoting leaf detachment. In relation with root growth, both waterlogging treatments resulted in root mortality (i.e., negative RGR) and values could not be restored, continuing with tissue death until maturity. These results contrast with those of <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cannell et al. (1979)</xref> in which growth stage was important in determining the effects of short-term (5-day) waterlogging on pea; as plants waterlogged at 24-day-old (vegetative stage) attained 41 and 47% of controls in shoot and seed dry mass, respectively, while when the stress was imposed on 47-day-old plants (flowering stage), these plants attained 34 and 25% of controls in shoot and seed dry mass. In our study, 2 weeks of water excess had severe adverse effects at both growth stages and so did not allow us to discriminate responses according to the growth stage. Similarly, another report showed dramatic reductions of shoot RGR (only 17% of controls) after exposing 35-day old plants of field pea to 1-week waterlogging when assessed 10 days after water subsided (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Solaiman et al., 2007</xref>). The sensitivity of field pea to waterlogging is further highlighted by the detrimental effect on plant seed production, with values of 4 and 8% of controls for early- and late-waterlogging. Even waterlogging for 5 days at the beginning of flowering decreased seed production in field pea to 38% of controls (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Pampana et al., 2016b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There were substantial differences among the four winter crop species in tolerance to waterlogging. Wheat leaf physiology and shoot growth were not significantly affected by waterlogging in early- or late-stages of growth, but seed production was reduced to 86 and 71% of controls when plants experienced early- and late-waterlogging, respectively. In barley and rapeseed the growth stage when the stress occurred was critical for determining the effects on leaf physiological performance, dry mass responses and seed production (seed mass was on average 82 and 29% of controls in early- and late-waterlogging, respectively). For barley during early-waterlogging, photosynthesis was compromised by stomatal limitations and root growth was impacted; however, upon drainage plants recovered. During late-waterlogging of barley, photosynthesis was also initially reduced by stomatal limitations but then by non-stomatal (i.e., lower <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub>) effects, and negative root RGR (indicating death of root tissue) was also observed; physiological parameters were restored only near maturity, leading to an unsuccessful growth recovery. In rapeseed, photosynthesis was compromised by non-stomatal limitations and root RGR was negative in both waterlogging treatments, and there were differences between growth stages in the ability (and available time) to recover from the stress, as plants could only show an acceptable recovery after water subsided in early-waterlogging. Field pea was severely affected either by early- or late-waterlogging, attaining on average 6% of controls for seed mass. During both waterlogging treatments, photosynthesis was decreased by non-stomatal limitations and root and shoot growths were both also compromised, and recovery was poor. Therefore, this study contributes to the understanding of the differential tolerances to early- and late-waterlogging of wheat, barley, rapeseed and field pea, by integrating leaf physiological variables related to carbon fixation, the ability (or not) to form aerenchyma in adventitious roots, along with shoot and root growth during the stress and importantly also recovery post-waterlogging, and ultimately, the impact on plant seed production.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors listed above made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to this work.
