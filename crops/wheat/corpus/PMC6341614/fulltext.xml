T cell-based transfer therapies are promising therapeutic approaches which in vivo efficacy is often limited by the small proportion of administered cells that reaches the region of interest. Manipulating T cell localisation to improve specific targeting will increase the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanotechnology has been successfully used for localized release of drugs and biomolecules. In particular, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded with biomolecules can be specifically targeted to a location by an external magnetic field (EMF). The present work studies whether MNP-loaded T cells could be targeted and retained in vitro and in vivo at a site of interest with an EMF.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">T cells were unable to internalize the different MNPs used in this study, which remained in close association with the cell membrane. T cells loaded with an appropriate MNP concentration were attracted to an EMF and retained in an in vitro capillary flow-system. MNP-loaded T cells were also magnetically retained in the lymph nodes after adoptive transfer in in vivo models. This enhanced in vivo retention was in part due to the EMF application and to a reduced circulating cell speed within the organ. This combined use of MNPs and EMFs did not alter T cell viability or function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">These studies reveal a promising approach to favour cell retention that could be implemented to improve cell-based therapy.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="12951_2019_440_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/>

The idea of specifically modulating the immune response represents an attractive approach to restore or enhance the immune system&#x02019;s ability to fight cancer or control autoimmune diseases. In particular, immune cell-based therapies, which are based on the use of the patient&#x02019;s own cells after in vitro expansion and/or modification, are currently one of the most appealing strategies in this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This approach can be applied to treat either cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The clinical response rates that these strategies elicit are nonetheless strongly correlated to the number of transferred cells that reach the desired region. As such, one of the main limitations of cell-based therapies is the dispersion of the in vivo-administered cells which results in only a small proportion of cells reaching the site of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is therefore a clear need to develop new strategies that promote specific cell infiltration, accumulation and survival in specific tissues so that they can exert their function effectively.</p><p id="Par5">Nanotechnological approaches can offer a solution, as they can increase treatment effectiveness by concentrating therapeutic molecules in the required region. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems can access difficult-to-reach sites because of their small size. They can be directed by active or passive strategies based on the nanomaterial physical and chemical properties and/or through addition of targeting moieties in the nanoparticle coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One promising active approach is based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, which can be localized precisely in the desired area by applying an external magnetic field (EMF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This approach could promote specific cell accumulation and thereby improve the efficacy of cell transfer therapies. Non-lymphoid cells loaded with these magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be inoculated systemically and attracted to a target tissue in mice by the application of an EMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These studies focused mainly on enriching stem cells, mesenchymal cells, macrophages or dendritic cells to control tissue injury and immune disorders. Studies using in vivo delivery of magnetically guided lymphoid cells to treat cancer and autoimmunity are very limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and this field remains vastly unexplored. The manipulation of highly motile effector lymphoid cells such as T or natural killer (NK) cells to target and accumulate them to a specific region such as lymph nodes (LNs) or solid tumours could be a promising approach to enhance their activity in the desired area.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we focus on T lymphocytes, an essential effector cell of the adaptive immune system, which continuous circulation is very dynamic compared to other immune cells such as dendritic cells or macrophages. During an immune response, T cells need to interact with other cells and detect antigens in different contexts and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. T cell migration, which is tightly regulated by multiple factors, such as cellular expression of selectins and chemokine receptors and interaction with other cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), is critical for the development of effective T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. T cells circulate through lymphoid and target organs where they can search for their cognate antigen either on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in lymphoid organs or on target cells in peripheral organs. Initial T cell activation steps occur in SLOs such as the LNs, where the tissue organization allows murine primary T cells to encounter their cognate antigen on APCs coming from different tissues and become activated. Once activated, these antigen-experienced T cells scan peripheral tissues to find and eliminate their antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Manipulating T cells to target specific locations could therefore be an interesting strategy to promote for instance their accumulation in the SLOs during priming and activation to enhance the immune response, or to favour their retention in the target tissue once activated. MNP-loading of T cells could thus be used for these targeting purposes as long as T cell function and interaction with chemokines, adhesion molecules and other cell types is not impaired by the treatment.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we evaluated the possibility that MNPs could be used as a platform to magnetically guide T cells to a region of interest. We assess T cell migration functionality after MNP treatment as well as their in vitro and in vivo manipulation to a target site through the application of an EMF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Iron oxide core synthesis</title><p id="Par8">Iron oxide cores were prepared by following the Massart coprecipitation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Briefly, 445&#x000a0;ml of a mixture of FeCl<sub>3</sub>&#x000b7;6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.09&#x000a0;mol) and FeCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;4H<sub>2</sub>O (0.054&#x000a0;mol) were added to 75&#x000a0;ml of NH<sub>4</sub>OH (25%). This addition was performed slowly and under vigorous stirring. The mixture was heated at 90&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 90&#x000a0;min to prepare nanoparticles of approximately 12&#x000a0;nm in diameter. After that, the sample was washed three times with distilled water by magnetic decantation. To oxidize magnetite to maghemite and activate surface for subsequent steps, the precipitate was treated with 300&#x000a0;ml of HNO<sub>3</sub> (2&#x000a0;M) under stirring for 15&#x000a0;min. Then, nitric acid was removed by magnetic decantation, and 75&#x000a0;ml of Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (1&#x000a0;M) and 130&#x000a0;ml of water were added over the preparation. The mixture was heated up to boiling temperature and stirred for 30&#x000a0;min.

Briefly, for DMSA coating (DMSA-MNPs), 14.7&#x000a0;mg (0.08&#x000a0;mmol) of DMSA were added to a suspension of 30&#x000a0;ml of the iron oxide cores (0.05&#x000a0;M) under stirring at pH 3. After this, the pH was increased to 11 and the sample was sonicated for 20&#x000a0;min. After coating, this suspension was dialyzed for 2&#x000a0;days and finally; the pH was adjusted to 7. For APS coating (APS-MNPs), 1.17&#x000a0;ml (0.005&#x000a0;mol) of APS was added very slowly to a mixture of 10&#x000a0;ml of the iron oxide cores (28&#x000a0;g Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> per l) and 10&#x000a0;ml of methanol under vigorous stirring for 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;h. Methanol was eliminated from the mixture using a rotary evaporator. The sample was then washed three times with a mixture of acetone/water (70/30) and redispersed in 10&#x000a0;ml of distilled water. The pH was decreased to 3 and the sample was sonicated for 1&#x000a0;h. Finally, the pH was adjusted to 7 and sonicated for 10&#x000a0;min. For Dextran coating (DEXT-MNPs), the iron oxide core dispersion [600&#x000a0;mg of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in 4.8&#x000a0;ml NaOH (0.8&#x000a0;M)] was added dropwise into a solution of 600&#x000a0;mg of dextran (6 kD) in 7.5&#x000a0;ml NaOH (0.5&#x000a0;M) under sonication. The mixture was sonicated for 6&#x000a0;h under refrigeration.

</p><p id="Par37">After verifying that MNP treatment did not impair T cell homing capacity, these experiments were repeated with an EMF applied to a popliteal LN to potentially enhance cell retention at this location.

EMF application increased the amount of cells found on the popliteal LN where the magnet was applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d, e). The slight increase also detected in MNP-free cells in the LN with EMF application was probably due to their interaction with MNP-treated cells in the cell mixture prior to injection, resulting in MNP transfer and/or aggregation of treated and untreated cells. Indeed, control inoculations of MNP-free cells alone showed no differential increase of this cell population in the LN over which the EMF was applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f).

For this, intravital two-photon microscopy of popliteal LNs was performed in the absence of EMF or in EMF presence on one side or on both sides of the popliteal LN to increase magnetic field strength (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a, b). A combination of MNP-loaded and MNP-free cells (ratio 1:1) was inoculated just prior to recording and cell speed while traveling through the popliteal LN was analysed with the Imaris software. Image analysis from the recorded movies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Movie S3; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Movie S4; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Movie S5) showed that MNP-loaded cells had a 10% reduction in their speed compared to MNP-free cells even in the absence of EMF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>c, d). No preferential location or directionality was observed in these experiments, even in the presence of an EMF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S3). Image analysis nonetheless confirmed that the MNP-loaded T cells were better retained in the popliteal LN than MNP-free cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>d). EMF application further reduced MNP-loaded T cell speed in the popliteal LN, and this was exacerbated by the application of 2 EMF. Surprisingly the speed of MNP-free cells was also reduced in the popliteal LN when an EMF was applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>c, d).

The MNPs used in this study were produced by the coprecipitation method and had an average core diameter of 12.5&#x000a0;nm. FTIR spectra and DLS measurements confirmed coating procedure succeeded in creating monodispersed MNP preparations with different surface charges. MNP treatment did not cause any toxicity in the human T cell line Jurkat or in murine primary T cells in the conditions tested. MNP-treated murine primary T cells, however, presented a higher mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. This could be associated with an activated state in T cells, since aerobic glycolysis increases during the transition to effector T cells. Moreover, glycolytic catabolism is also associated with T cell functionalities such as T<sub>reg</sub> and memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Microscopy analysis showed that unlike macrophages, mesenchymal or malignant cells, which are able to internalize different type of MNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], including the ones used in the present study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], T cells are apparently unable to do so. MNPs remain on the cell surface in close contact with cell membrane. T cells have typically low phagocytic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with large nuclei and reduced cytoplasm, which could impair MNP entry inside the cytoplasm. Moreover, it has been also described that transfection of such cell types has always presented many difficulties and limitations, being a really inefficient process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The low endocytic capacity of lymphoid cells has been already reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and a special nanoparticle design is usually required to improve internalization by these nonphagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. For example, some studies indicate that the uptake of NPs can be increased by coupling the NP to peptides or proteins, such as Tat protein of HIV, that exhibit a high permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Microscopy analysis and cell-associated iron quantification showed that APS-MNPs were the MNPs most associated with T cells and they were therefore selected to perform subsequent magnetic retention experiments. DMSA-MNPs and DEXT-MNPs have negative and neutral charges respectively, whereas APS-MNPs are positively charged which probably favour their interaction with the negative potential of the cell membrane. There is a general tendency to assume that positively charged nanoparticles interact further with cell membranes, possibly due to electrostatic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In this study, the positive MNPs (APS-MNPs) were the ones that interacted most with the membrane of the lymphoid cells, which correlates with what is described in the literature. Besides, some of the neutral and negative MNPs (DEXT- and DMSA-MNPs respectively) also interact but with smaller areas of the cell surface. This could be explained by the fact that, although cell membrane is, in general, negatively charged, it also presents areas with cationic sites allowing the binding of negatively charged NPs resulting in the clustering of the NPs around those domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Cytometric analyses of MNP-treated T cells showed that APS-MNPs caused no differences in the expression levels of important cell surface markers such as CD62L, CD44, CD11a or CCR7 in Jurkat and primary T cell. These data are in consonance with previous reports showing that MNPs have no significant effect on the expression levels of surface markers of a variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

MNP loading slightly decreased chemotactic responses. Our data nonetheless indicate that the adequate application of an EMF could correct this defect, probably because the magnetic gradient facilitated the migration of these MNP-loaded cells. Similar results are reported in dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], which indicate that MNP loading of immune cells could affect their chemotaxis. One of the main concerns of the present study was to evaluate the capacity of a magnetic field to promote the retention of MNP-loaded T cells in the presence of flow forces similar to the ones found in blood vessels. Our results showed that a minimal amount of MNPs was required for T cells to be retained by an EMF. This magnetic retention increases with the amount of MNPs associated to the cells as well as with the magnetic field magnitude. Other studies also reported that these two parameters are critical for this magnetic targeting to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The in vivo analysis of T cell homing capacity in the presence or absence of MNPs revealed a higher amount of MNP-loaded T cells retained in the LNs, indicating that the presence of MNPs on the surface of T cells could increase by itself their retention in SLOs. MNP-loaded cells, however, did not show any preferential location or distribution for a specific SLO. The preferential accumulation of MNP-loaded T cells in lymphoid tissues even in the absence of a magnetic field has the potential to favour T cell interactions with accessory cells in these organs where T cell activation occurs. This property of MNP-loaded T cells could be used to promote T cell responses to specific antigens as well as to modulate the immune response in a pathological context. For example, for therapies based on adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (T regs), approaches enhancing the LN trafficking and retention of these T regs could be beneficial to prevent immune-mediated diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The strategic LN enrichment of antigen-specific T regs is crucial in controlling autoreactive effector T cells (T effs) and autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. For instance, it has been described that the accumulation of regulatory T cells in a LN near an ovary, counteracts the pathogenic immune response that takes place during ovarian autoimmune disease, inhibiting therefore its development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Besides, there are studies showing that the recirculation of T regs in mesenteric LNs contributes to the downregulation of intestinal inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], that their accumulation in the draining LN of the lung correlates with the resolution of chronic asthma in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and also that the migration of T regs to specific draining LNs is required to suppress the alloimmune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and is capable to induce suppression of arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Therefore, the modulation of T cell trafficking could have interest in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This preferential accumulation of MNP-loaded T cells in lymphoid tissues was also confirmed in the SPIM analyses of the LNs. There are some reports that analyse the biodistribution of MNP-labelled cells in different organs at short time points by magnetic resonance imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Dodd et al. showed that most of na&#x000ef;ve and memory T cells migrated to the spleen and LNs but also to the lungs and liver after adoptive transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. It is also described that in a tumour model, MNP-labelled CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulated preferentially in the spleen and lymphoid tissues as well as in the tumour but also in the liver and in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In this in vivo analysis, the application of an EMF favoured the retention of MNP-loaded transferred cells in the LN exposed to the magnet, indicating that, after reaching the LN, more MNP-loaded T cells were retained due to the presence of the EMF. Similar results have been obtained using other different cell types and regions of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Our results reinforce the idea of magnetic targeting as a way to improve specific cell accumulation and extend its application to T lymphocytes, a relatively unexplored field.</p><p id="Par44">Two-photon microscopy intravital in vivo behaviour of MNP-loaded T cells in the popliteal LNs confirmed the increased retention of MNP-loaded T cells in lymphoid organs and revealed a 10% reduction in their speed compared to MNP-free T cells. The increased retention of MNP-loaded T cells in lymphoid organs even in the absence of EMF (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, c) could thus be due to a reduced circulating speed that would prolong cell interaction with lymphoid tissue vasculature and facilitate retention. Unexpectedly, the speed of both MNP-loaded and &#x02013;free T cells was reduced when applying an EMF. This could be partly due to the interaction between loaded and unloaded cells in the mixture prior to inoculation as previously demonstrated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d&#x02013;f), resulting in the transfer of some MNPs to the unloaded T cells. Additionally, it has been previously described that cells associated with MNPs present a greater tendency to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], so MNP-loaded cells could probably interact further with other surrounding cells, treated or not with MNPs. Alternatively, moderate static magnetic fields can influence biological systems, mostly due to alterations of the transmembrane ion flux and the membrane phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Preliminary calcium imaging assays did not show significant alterations in calcium fluxes, essential for T cell functionality, neither in the maximum response nor the time to achieve it, in the presence of MNP in the case of Jurkat cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5a, c). Murine T cells, however, showed a decrease in both, the maximum response and the mean response after MNP loading (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S5b, d). Further studies would be needed to confirm this finding and determine its biological significance. Biological effects supposedly depend more on the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient than on its strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. This could explain the increased reduction in cell speed obtained in intravital experiments when two magnets were placed over the popliteal LN. This reduced speed could also have some interest. It has been reported that the duration of the interaction between dendritic cells and T cells in the LNs affects the specificity and potency of the T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The decrease in the speed of T cells in the LN could serve to favour their interaction with the dendritic cells and the generation of more powerful T cell responses with a greater affinity. Cell path analysis in these experiments indicated that MNP loading does not influence the lymphocyte trajectory inside de LN when an EMF is applied, although further analysis over longer time periods and with increased EMF strength could be necessary to detect trajectory changes due to the complex tissue architecture of LN. Some of these effects could also be masked by MNP transfer to unloaded cells during inoculum preparation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">T lymphocyte migration is a strongly regulated process, essential in the development of potent and effective immune responses against different antigens. In the present study, we successfully show that the use of MNPs and EMFs can guide and retain T lymphocytes to a target region of interest without critically affecting crucial biological aspects of these cells. We demonstrate that MNP-loaded murine T cells can be magnetically retained in the LNs, which could be useful to modulate immune response in a pathological context. This strategy could potentially be applied to other regions of interest, such as a tumour, to enhance the antitumoral immune response led by activated T cells.</p><p id="Par46">Thus, our study describes an interesting and affordable approach to promote T cell retention that could be implemented in adoptive cell transfer therapies.
