    "The current application of genome editing to crop plants is limited to cultivars that are amenable to in vitro culture and regeneration. Here, we report an in planta genome-editing which does not require callus culture and regeneration. Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) contain a subepidermal cell layer, L2, from which germ cells later develop during floral organogenesis. The biolistic delivery of gold particles coated with plasmids expressing CRISPR/Cas9 components designed to target TaGASR7 were bombarded into SAM-exposed embryos of imbibed seeds. Bombarded embryos showing transient GFP expression within SAM were selected and grown into adult plants. Mutations in the target gene were assessed in fifth-leaf tissue by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence analysis. Eleven (5.2%) of the 210 bombarded plants carried mutant alleles, and the mutations of three (1.4%) of these were inherited in the next generation. Genotype analysis of T1 plants identified plants homozygous for the three homeologous genes, which were all derived from one T0 plant. These plants showed no detectable integration of the Cas9 and guide RNA genes, indicating that transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 introduced the mutations. Together, our current method can be used to achieve in planta genome editing in wheat using CRISPR/Cas9 and suggests possible applications to other recalcitrant plant species and variations."
