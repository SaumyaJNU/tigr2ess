    "Extracellular enzymes play an important role in the growth and development of edible fungi. Extracellular enzyme activities have also become an important object of measurement. In this study, Agaricus brunnescens Peck, Coprinus comatus, and Pleurotus ostreatus were compared in terms of their enzyme production in liquid-and solid-state fermentation. Differences in the ability of various types of edible fungi to utilize biomass raw materials were analyzed by monitoring the fiber degradation rate during crop straw degradation, and changes in their cellulolytic enzyme systems during growth and metabolism were discussed. This study provided insights into the changes in the lignocellulose degradation ability of edible fungi during their growth and facilitated the discovery of new approaches to accelerate their growth in culture."
