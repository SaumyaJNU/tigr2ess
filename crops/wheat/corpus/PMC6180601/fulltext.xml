The use of intercropped lucerne and wheat may comply with the directives. In the current study, the combination of ensiled lucerne (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.) and wheat straw as substrate for hydrogen and methane production was investigated. Steam-pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed wheat straw [WSH, 76% of total chemical oxygen demand (COD)] and ensiled lucerne (LH, 24% of total COD) were used for sequential hydrogen production through dark fermentation and methane production through anaerobic digestion and directly for anaerobic digestion. Synthetic co-cultures of extreme thermophilic <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species adapted to elevated osmolalities were used for dark fermentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Based on 6 tested steam pretreatment conditions, 5&#x000a0;min at 200&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C was chosen for the ensiled lucerne. The same conditions as applied for wheat straw (10&#x000a0;min at 200&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with 1% acetic acid) would give similar sugar yields. Volumetric hydrogen productivities of 6.7 and 4.3&#x000a0;mmol/L/h and hydrogen yields of 1.9 and 1.8&#x000a0;mol/mol hexose were observed using WSH and the combination of WSH and LH, respectively, which were relatively low compared to those of the wild-type strains. The combinations of WSH plus LH and the effluent from dark fermentation of WSH plus LH were efficiently converted to methane in anaerobic digestion with COD removal of 85&#x02013;89% at organic loading rates of COD 5.4 and 8.5&#x000a0;g/L/day, respectively, in UASB reactors. The nutrients in the combined hydrolysates could support this conversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the water addition to WSH by 26% and the phosphorus addition by 80% in dark fermentation with <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species, compared to previous reports. WSH and combined WSH and LH were well tolerated by osmotolerant co-cultures. The yield was not significantly different when using defined media or hydrolysates with the same concentrations of sugars. However, the sugar concentration was negatively correlated with the hydrogen yield when comparing the results to previous reports. Hydrolysates and effluents from dark fermentation can be efficiently converted to methane. Lucerne can serve as macronutrient provider in anaerobic digestion. Intercropping with wheat is promising.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13068-018-1280-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intercropping</kwd><kwd>Energy crops</kwd><kwd>Alfalfa</kwd><kwd><italic>Caldicellulosirupto</italic>r</kwd><kwd>Thermophilic hydrogen production</kwd><kwd>Osmotolerance</kwd><kwd>Biogas</kwd><kwd>Co-substrate</kwd><kwd>UASB</kwd><kwd>Biofuel</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004527</institution-id><institution>Energimyndigheten</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31090-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Niel</surname><given-names>Ed W.

In an amendment, it is stated that the contribution of biofuels from crops rich in oil, sugar or starch, as well as energy crops causing high indirect land use change, should be restricted to 7% of the energy used in the transportation sector by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2015, only 6.7% of the energy used in the transportation sector in the EU was renewable, and most was of the type that should be phased out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To increase the production of biofuel despite these restrictions, the EU is promoting research and development of biofuels (transportation fuels) from feedstock that does not compete with food production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Methane and hydrogen are interesting energy carriers with respect to meeting the EU&#x02019;s 10% goal of renewable fuel in domestic transportation. Methane can be produced from organic waste and by processing residues through anaerobic digestion, and can be converted into other fuels, using processes with low environmental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hydrogen production through dark fermentation is less well developed, but this gas is considered a promising energy carrier since its combustion produces zero carbon emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Research in the production of these energy carriers is further motivated by their use in electricity generation and chemical synthesis, e.g. ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or oil and fat hydrogenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another advantage of anaerobic digestion is that the residues, i.e. the biodigestates, are widely applied as fertilizers in agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Wheat straw is one of the most abundant crop residues in the world and, thus, an interesting substrate for biofuel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is one of the raw materials of choice in the first commercial cellulosic ethanol plant, which was opened in Crescentino, Italy in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The effluent from ethanol production contains residual organic material that has been successfully converted into methane in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using direct anaerobic digestion, simply chopped wheat straw can give a relatively high methane yield with long retention times [310&#x000a0;L per kg volatile solids (VS) after 127&#x000a0;days] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Steam pretreatment has been shown to accelerate degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] resulting in a 39% increase in methane yield after 31&#x000a0;days of digestion in a batch test (methane 250&#x000a0;L per kg VS compared to 180&#x000a0;L per kg VS using untreated chopped straw) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has also been shown to be relatively energy and cost efficient pretreatment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Except from increasing the conversion rate, steam pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis have the potential to reduce reactor sizes and, thereby, processing costs, due to the possibility of applying higher organic loading rates in anaerobic digestion when using liquid instead of solid substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A high degree of conversion of solubilised sugars has been demonstrated for steam-pretreated and enzymatically hydrolysed wheat straw in sequential thermophilic dark fermentation, with <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus</italic>, in stirred tank reactors, and mesophilic anaerobic digestion (with mixed microbial culture) in UASB reactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The main by-product of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> is acetate, which was readily converted, together with many non-metabolised compounds, to methane in the anaerobic digestion process.</p><p id="Par35">The extremely thermophilic <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species exhibit hydrogen yields near the theoretical thermodynamic maximum for both hexose sugars (4&#x000a0;mol H<sub>2</sub> per mol) and pentose sugars (3.33&#x000a0;mol H<sub>2</sub> per mol). They are also relatively tolerant to high hydrogen partial pressures up to 67&#x000a0;kPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a hydrogen productivity of 8.69&#x000a0;mmol/L/h was achieved from 10 times diluted wheat straw hydrolysate (WSH). <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> is, however, unable to grow in concentrated hydrolysates due to its osmosensitivity. Strains of <italic>C. saccharolyticus</italic> species that tolerate higher osmolality have recently been developed through adaptive laboratory evolution for use in higher concentration substrates. They have been shown to tolerate between 50 and 80&#x000a0;g/L sugar, compared to 10&#x000a0;g/L sugar for the parental strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Increased substrate concentration can reduce water and energy demands in dark fermentation considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, synthetic co-cultures of <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species have displayed better performance than pure cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it remains to be determined whether these strains also tolerate more highly concentrated hydrolysates from plant residues.</p><p id="Par36">One drawback of using wheat straw in dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion is the low content of many crucial nutrients and, thus, nutrient supplements are needed. However, the use of nutrients derived from mining (e.g. phosphorus) and ammonium produced with help of fossil fuels is not a sustainable practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, nutrients such as yeast extract and phosphates contribute substantially to the production costs, making this process uncompetitive with fossil-based fuel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although macronutrients can be provided by the addition of co-substrates such as certain industrial wastes, organic fractions of municipal household waste, or manure, the availability varies geographically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Alternatively, a lack of co-substrate can be mitigated by the cultivation of a nutrient-rich crop for use as a co-substrate.</p><p id="Par37">Lucerne (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.), also known as alfalfa, is a widely cultivated legume and has several favourable characteristics in agricultural production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Lucerne is cultivated on approx. 30 million hectares worldwide, of which 25% (7.12&#x000a0;million hectares) is located in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Like other legumes, lucerne can form symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing microorganisms and thereby supply nitrogen. Furthermore, nitrogen and other nutrients can be cycled by fertilising the soil with the residues of the anaerobic digestion process and, thereby, reduce the input of industrially synthesised or mined minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Legume intercropping with wheat in organic cultivation has been shown to increase the grain yield in subsequent maize cultivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further, intercropping of legumes in organic winter wheat was found not to influence the grain yield. However, in one-third of cases it did reduce the wheat grain protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the same trials, intercropping was found to reduce the density of weeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Spring fertilisation with organic fertilizer was recently reported to decrease the legume biomass yield, but improve the grain yield and protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although the legume was left on field in the above-mentioned studies, it can also be harvested together with the wheat straw some weeks after the wheat grain harvest, for use as a substrate for dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. After fermentation, the residue can be used as fertilizer. Intercropping has the potential to comply with the land use regulations in the EU directives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Anaerobic digestion of lucerne resulted in a methane yield of 280 to 430&#x000a0;L per kg VS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These yields are in the same range as the methane yields from maize, which is one of the most widely used energy crops in commercial anaerobic digestion and used without other pretreatment than chopping and ensiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, it is uncertain if it is economically advantageous to pretreat pure lucerne prior to anaerobic digestion. However, in dark fermentation using co-cultures of only a few species, many of the diverse compounds may not be degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and, therefore, part of the sugar polymers might not be accessible without pretreatment.</p><p id="Par40">Some groups have investigated the pretreatment of lucerne for ethanol production, but not for the production of other fuels. Ambient-temperature acid pretreatment followed by ensiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] dilute-acid pretreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], ammonia pretreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], wet explosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], hydrothermal pretreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and steam pretreatment without a catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] have been evaluated in attempts to improve the degradability of lucerne prior to ethanol production.</p><p id="Par41">Compounds synthesised from fossil fuels or mined from non-renewable sources are commonly used not only as nutrient supplements and as buffering agents, but also as mineral acid catalysts in steam pretreatment. Joelsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] showed that mineral acids could be replaced by acetic acid in steam pretreatment of wheat straw for ethanol and biogas production, without decreasing the biofuel yield. Another option is to use ensiled raw materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which already contain organic acids, such as lactic acid and acetic acid. This will reduce the cost of chemicals in the process. Since acetic acid is produced during dark fermentation by <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> spp. and can be degraded in anaerobic digestion, the application of acetic acid as a catalyst opens the possibility for future process integration with internal production, use and degradation.</p><p id="Par42">In the current study, wheat straw and ensiled lucerne were steam pretreated and hydrolysed using enzymes. After the enzymatic hydrolysis (EH), the materials were filtered to obtain the wheat straw hydrolysate (WSH) and the lucerne hydrolysate (LH) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Wheat straw was steam pretreated with acetic acid as catalyst and lucerne both with and without acetic acid as a catalyst, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (EH).

The solid fraction of steam-pretreated lucerne samples consisted of 40.4&#x02013;42.9% glucan, 5.9&#x02013;7.4% xylan, and 36.9&#x02013;41.9% lignin (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The pH of the liquid fractions was between 4.9 and 5.2, and they contained high amounts of lactic acid (6.7&#x02013;7.3&#x000a0;g/L) and acetic acid (7.3&#x02013;11.6&#x000a0;g/L), due to high concentration of these acids in the ensiled material. The glucose and xylose contents (expressed as monomer concentration) in the liquid fractions were 0.6&#x02013;0.9 and 6.9&#x02013;8.2&#x000a0;g/L, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Generally, there were only very slight differences between the compositions of the various pretreated lucerne materials. The rather high residual xylan content in the solid fractions after pretreatment together with a relatively low concentration of xylose in the liquid fractions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) indicated that the severity of the pretreatment was low. This was also supported by the observation that after steam pretreatment the concentrations of HMF and furfural were below the detection limit. Furthermore, the high pH after pretreatment indicated that the material contained compounds that had a buffering effect during the process, which might also have contributed to the low severity. High pH and low furan contents in hydrothermally pretreated lucerne have also been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-pretreated lucerne samples</title><p id="Par72">To identify the best pretreatment conditions for the lucerne silage, the hydrolysability of the 6 pretreated materials was investigated. After 72&#x000a0;h of EH at 5% WIS, the glucose and xylose concentrations in the hydrolysates were 9.9&#x02013;11.7 and 5.3&#x02013;6.4&#x000a0;g/L, respectively. These sugar concentrations corresponded to overall yields of the sum of glucose and xylose of 0.148&#x02013;0.162&#x000a0;g per g DM initial ensiled lucerne. The highest overall yield was obtained in pretreatment 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which was 74.9% of the theoretical yield based on the glucose and xylose content of ensiled lucerne. Galactose and arabinose concentrations in the EH were under 0.5&#x000a0;g/L and, therefore, these sugars were neglected in the calculations. Based on these results, pretreatment 2 (200&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 10&#x000a0;min, no catalyst) was selected for the preparation of the LH for the fermentation experiments. The sugar concentrations in the larger batch hydrolysed at 7.5% WIS were 12.9&#x000a0;g/L glucose and 4.8&#x000a0;g/L xylose, corresponding to a sugar yield of 0.12&#x000a0;g glucose and xylose per g DM initial ensiled lucerne.

Overall the COD yield per kg initial DM was 0.61&#x000a0;kg for WS and 0.76&#x000a0;kg for LH. The higher COD yield from LH can be explained by solubilisation of proteins and other compounds in LH. As expected, the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in LH were considerably higher (20 and 6 times, respectively) than in WSH (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, rows C and D). Moreover, the contents of Ca, Mg, S, B, Mo and Se were 24, 15, 7, 28, 12 and 333 times higher in LH than in WSH.</p><p id="Par74">The addition of 1 wt% acetic acid was found to be unnecessary prior to steam pretreatment as ensiled lucerne contained significant amounts of acetic acid from the ensiling process and, moreover, similar sugar yields were obtained regardless of the conditions applied. This exemplifies that ensiled materials can reduce the cost of chemicals in steam pretreatment. In a previous study, ensiling of wheat straw prior to hydrothermal treatment increased the effect of pretreatment, thereby enabling to reduce the pretreatment temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Pretreatment of the lucerne used in the current study at the same conditions as optimal for wheat straw (pretreatment 4) would give similar sugar yield as the chosen condition did (pretreatment 2). Co-pretreatment of intercropped and co-harvested lucerne and wheat straw can, therefore, likely be feasible. However, harvest of lucerne at another maturation stage can influence the effect of pretreatment. Likewise, the use of straw from spring wheat instead of winter wheat as well as the use of other cultivars or cultivation conditions may need different pretreatment conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Medium and strain adjustment for dark fermentation</title><p id="Par76">A new medium (EB-1), based on the quantities of various elements in the cell mass of <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic>, was designed to optimise the concentration of elements (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

When using CH-DFE, to which buffering agents were added prior to dark fermentation, the partial alkalinity of the anaerobic digestion effluent was higher, but still low: 1.8&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;g/L (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). This is a low alkalinity for UASB reactors according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and makes the processes sensitive to disturbances. Another weakness in the process design was that the effluent was pumped out at the same rate as the feed was pumped in, which sometimes caused the liquid level to decrease below the level for recirculation outflow, since some mass is lost to the gas phase. Spontaneous outflow using a water-lock or other solutions that ensure an adequate liquid level should have been applied. When recirculation is interrupted, the OLR will increase in the lower part of the reactors and acids will easily accumulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], which is a likely reason for the acidification seen. The chance that sugar-derived inhibitors HMF and furfural were the cause of acidification might be small as in the current study the concentrations of these inhibitors were lower than the concentrations (2&#x000a0;g/L and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L, respectively) shown to cause inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

Also, the methane yield was not significantly different from that presented in a study using hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw for anaerobic digestion in UASB reactors at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], but at a lower OLR (2.8&#x000a0;g<sub>COD</sub>/L/day) with highly diluted substrate (COD 3.8 g/L compared to 34&#x000a0;g/L in the present study). However, Kaparaju et al.

The OLRs for the hydrolysates demonstrated in the current study and by Pawar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] are higher than typical for anaerobic digestion of chopped energy crops in completely stirred tank reactors, which is the dominant procedure. For instance, Nges and Bj&#x000f6;rnsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] demonstrated decreasing methane yields for three crops mixtures when increasing the OLR above 3&#x02013;4.5&#x000a0;kg VS per m<sup>3</sup> reactor and day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Lucerne as nutrient provider in anaerobic digestion</title><p id="Par83">It was predicted that combining LH, corresponding to 24% of the COD, with WSH (76% of COD), which are the proportions in CH-1, would satisfy the demand for N and P as well as for B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Se in anaerobic digestion, based on the assumptions described in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Nutrient demand and nutrient addition in anaerobic digestion</xref>&#x0201d;. Likewise, it was found that the substrate proportions in CH-DFE (same proportions as in CH-1 based on initial raw material) would satisfy the demand of the same nutrients. The amounts of several micronutrients were, however, predicted to be insufficient in the combined hydrolysates and were added together with extra selenium at levels based on practical trials by Banks et al.

Schmidt and Ahring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] report that as little as 12&#x000a0;mg/L of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the feed (compared to 22&#x02013;27&#x000a0;mg/L in the current study) could support 97% acetate conversion in UASB reactors loaded with acetate 8&#x000a0;g COD per day. However, some microbial biomass was lost during the operation, indicating that higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are likely needed for stable long-term operation. 240 and 740&#x000a0;mg/L could sustain the biomass level. No elements were found to be present at inhibiting levels in CH-1 and CH-DFE when the data in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1 were compared with the data summarised by Romero-G&#x000fc;iza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Energy yield per initial raw material</title><p id="Par86">In addition to the high conversion of organic material in the hydrolysates, found in the current study, utilisation of the solid side streams (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) would be needed to reach high substrate conversion efficiency. The methane yield of the CH-DFE corresponds to 4.32&#x000a0;MJ per kg initial DM, based on the lower heating value (LHV) of methane. The hydrogen energy yield from the WSH used for the production of CH-DFE to 0.18&#x000a0;MJ (LHV) per kg initial DM. Methane and hydrogen sum up to 4.5&#x000a0;MJ per kg initial DM. Nkemka and Murto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] report an LHV of untreated wheat straw of 16.3&#x000a0;MJ per kg DM. Approximating the LHV for dry lucerne to be the same as for dry wheat straw the energy yield would be only 28% of the total raw material, despite a yield of methane and hydrogen corresponding to more than 75% of the COD in the hydrolysates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). A large share of the raw material can be found in the solid side streams. Nkemka and Murto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] report a methane energy yield of 2.5&#x000a0;MJ (LHV) methane, or 15% of the energy in the initial raw material, per kg initial DM of wheat straw from the solid fraction after EH (when subjected to batch mode anaerobic digestion). The solid fraction (rich in lignin) can be used for multiple purposes. Barta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed through modelling that using the solid fraction of steam-pretreated and enzymatically saccharified hemp for combined heat and power production resulted in self-supporting and excess production of heat and electricity, in combined ethanol and biogas production. Similar results were found for biohythane process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], but in that case some of the energy was needed for compressing gas for stripping the biohydrogen reactor.</p><p id="Par87">Comparing the methane energy yield from lucerne and wheat straw in other studies further illustrates the importance of valorising the solid side streams for an overall high substrate utilisation. The methane energy yield from CH-1 is lower than that from non-pretreated lucerne, subjected to batch mode anaerobic digestion, reported by Hakl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]: 6.4&#x02013;10.0&#x000a0;MJ as LHV, per kg DM non-pretreated material. The methane energy yield from pretreated wheat straw without enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent fractionation, subjected to batch mode anaerobic digestion, was 10.7&#x000a0;MJ (LHV) per kg initial DM, corresponding to 66% of the energy in the raw material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Future studies</title><p id="Par88">The current study showed that dark fermentation of WSH at a sugar concentration of 30&#x000a0;g/L was possible. However, the hydrogen yield and productivity were lower when a sugar concentration of 10&#x000a0;g/L was used as reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In future studies, it would be interesting to explore the productivity and yield in dark fermentation when exchanging part of the water used to dilute the feed to dark fermentation with effluent from the anaerobic digestion process. Possibly the water and energy demand could be decreased by this approach, without decreasing the hydrogen productivity and yield from the levels demonstrated by Pawar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Recycling of effluent is common in anaerobic digestion and has been used to provide alkalinity and to dilute incoming feeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Modelling of recycling from a mesophilic photofermentation step to a 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C dark fermentation step has demonstrated the potential of reducing the water and energy demand by up to 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recycling of liquid from a mesophilic UASB to a 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C dark fermentation step using starch wastewater was shown to decrease the need for the addition of base to the dark fermentation reactor with 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. It remains to be investigated whether the accumulation of inhibitors would restrict such recycling of effluent from anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic substrates.</p><p id="Par89">As demonstrated in the current study, the liquefaction of solid plant biomass does allow the use of high rate UASB reactors in anaerobic digestion. As shown by Barta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the reactor cost can be reduced compared to that of a completely stirred tank reactor due to higher OLR and thereby smaller reactor volume. However, liquefaction of solid plant biomass by steam pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis with external enzymes is also costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Equalling many mixed anaerobic digestion cultures, the genus <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> has the potential to directly degrade cellulose and hemicellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. It would be of interest to compare the performance of the current process setup to a process fed with steam-pretreated wheat straw and lucerne to dark fermentation, without an enzymatic pretreatment step. This would also reduce the osmolarity due to the presence of polymeric rather than monomeric sugars and could thereby potentially allow higher substrate concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the water addition to WSH by 26% and the phosphorus additions by 80% and the omission of yeast extract in dark fermentation with <italic>Caldicellulosiruptor</italic> species, compared to previous reports. WSH and combined WSH and LH were well tolerated by osmotolerant co-cultures. The yield was not significantly different when using defined media or hydrolysates with the same concentrations of sugars. The sugar concentration was negatively correlated with the hydrogen yield though, when comparing the results to previous studies.</p><p id="Par91">Combined WSH and LH and effluent from dark fermentation of WSH plus LH were efficiently converted to methane in anaerobic digestion. Degree of dilution of hydrolysates was defined by the dark fermentation process. The effect of using hydrolysates with less or no water addition, after enzymatic hydrolysis, remains to be explored. For an overall high substrate conversion degree, utilisation of the solid fraction after enzymatic hydrolysis would also be required, in addition to the studied processes.</p><p id="Par92">The macronutrients in combined hydrolysate with 24% LH and 76% WSH, based on COD, could support an efficient conversion of organic matter to methane in anaerobic digestion. For start-up of a granular process and long-term stability, a higher share of LH, or supplements, might be needed.</p><p id="Par93">Finally, the presented results indicate that the same conditions for pretreating wheat can be applied to lucerne with little or no influence on the sugar yield. Consequentially, it will probably be possible to co-pretreat wheat straw and ensiled lucerne in this process. Further experiments are needed to prove this assumption. Intercropping of lucerne and wheat, and harvesting the wheat straw with the lucerne biomass after harvest of the wheat spikes, is an interesting possibility for production of feedstock for conversion to transportation fuel that deserves further attention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
