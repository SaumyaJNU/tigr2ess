    "Selenium plays a role in antioxidant status and, together with iodine, in thyroid function. Iodine deficiency exists in New Zealand during pregnancy and lactation, and selenium deficiency may further affect thyroid function. This study investigated selenium intakes of pregnant and lactating women, in Palmerston North, in the North Island of New Zealand. Dietary intake was estimated using three repeated 24-h dietary recalls. Dietary intake in pregnancy was also estimated from 24-h urinary excretion of selenium. Selenium concentrations were determined in urine and breastmilk using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Median selenium intakes based on dietary data were 51 (39, 65) μg/day in pregnancy and 51 (36, 80) μg/day in lactation, with 61% and 68% below estimated average requirement (EAR). Median daily selenium intake in pregnancy based on urinary excretion was 49 (40, 60) µg/day, with 59% below EAR. Median selenium concentration in breastmilk was 11 (10, 13) µg/L and estimated median selenium intake for infants was 9 (8, 10) µg/day, with 91% below the Adequate Intake of 12 μg/day. These pregnant and breastfeeding women were at risk of dietary selenium inadequacy. Further research is required to assess selenium status in relation to thyroid function and health in this group."
