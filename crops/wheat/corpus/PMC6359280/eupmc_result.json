    "Aquaporins (AQPs) are one diverse family of membrane channel proteins that play crucial regulatory roles in plant stress physiology. However, the heat stress responsiveness of AQP genes in soybean remains poorly understood. In this study, 75 non-redundant AQP encoding genes were identified in soybean. Multiple sequence alignments showed that all GmAQP proteins possessed the conserved regions, which contained 6 trans-membrane domains (TM1 to TM6). Different GmAQP members consisted of distinct Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs, aromatic/arginine (ar/R) selectivity filters and Froger's positions (FPs). Phylogenetic analyses distinguished five sub-families within these GmAQPs: 24 GmPIPs, 24 GmTIPs, 17 GmNIPs, 8 GmSIPs, and 2 GmXIPs. Promoter cis-acting elements analyses revealed that distinct number and composition of heat stress and hormone responsive elements existed in different promoter regions of GmAQPs. QRT-PCR assays demonstrated that 12 candidate GmAQPs with relatively extensive expression in various tissues or high expression levels in root or leaf exhibited different expression changes under heat stress and hormone cues (abscisic acid (ABA), l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid (ACC), salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)). Furthermore, the promoter activity of one previously functionally unknown AQP gene-GmTIP2;6 was investigated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity driven by the promoter of GmTIP2;6 was strongly induced in the heat- and ACC-treated transgenic plants and tended to be accumulated in the hypocotyls, vascular bundles, and leaf trichomes. These results will contribute to uncovering the potential functions and molecular mechanisms of soybean GmAQPs in mediating heat stress and hormone signal responses."
