Successful seed germination and normal seedling construction are the decisive factors for plant reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, research on the regulation mechanism of seed germination is important for agricultural production.</p><p id="Par38"><italic>Brassica napus</italic> is the second most important oilseed crop in the world, which occupies approximately 13&#x02013;16% of the world vegetable oil production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The seed germination and germination vigor are affected by many factors in <italic>B. napus</italic>, such as salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], plant hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The seed germination vigor of rapeseed could be enhanced by priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, a genome-wide association analysis showed that seed germination and radicle growth were strongly environment-dependent in <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Conditions during seed production and storage have a profound effect on seed vigor, and the performance of seed dormancy was related to differences in germination performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A number of genes, proteins or QTLs that correlated with germination were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and these genes included <italic>SNOWY COTYLEDON 1</italic> (<italic>Bna.SCO1</italic>), <italic>ARABIDOPSIS TWO-COMPONENT RESPONSE REGULATOR</italic> (<italic>Bna.ARR4</italic>) and <italic>ARGINYL-t-RNA PROTEIN TRANSFERASE 1</italic> (<italic>Bna.ATE1</italic>). The homologous genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have been shown to participate in seed germination and seedling growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A 90 kD heat shock protein (HSP 90) was detected in the elongating axes and cotyledons of germinating seedlings and could be induced by stress in <italic>B. napus</italic>, which highlights a role for HSP 90 during seed germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Jian et al. identified 19 QTLs that are associated with seed germination rates under salt and drought stress in <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Seed germination vigor refers to the potential to accomplish rapid, precise germination and seedling formation from seeds in field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Seed vigor has been shown to be closely related to crop field performance in variety of crops, especially in <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. After long-term storage, the seeds gradually deteriorate and lose their activity, which is known as the aging of seeds. High temperature and high humidity storage conditions could accelerate the aging process of seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is an important problem in practical seed production, and a significant cost has been paid in order to reduce the loss of seed vigor during storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Based on the present results in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, oxidative stress was an important factor in seed aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The loss of seed vigor during aging could be attributed to two aspects: one was protein changes in dry seeds, and the second was that low-activity seeds cannot express normal proteomes during germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The key mechanisms for maintaining seed vigor include the translation capacity, seed storage mobilization and antioxidant efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Additionally, some late embryogenesis abundant (LEAs) proteins and HSPs also play an important role in maintaining seed vigor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The fatty acid (FA) composition of rapeseed was changed dramatically in the aging process. In addition, the aging of seeds could also prolong the germination time, reduce the germination and the overwinter rate, and decrease the rapeseed yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds are always sown in autumn and harvested in late spring, so the seeds will go through a hot and humid summer, which can lead to the loss of germination vigor. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of seed germination and germination vigor is important for reducing the loss of seed vigor in <italic>B. napus</italic>. Yin et al. demonstrated that the primary factor contributing to the aging of <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds might not be the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but the accumulation of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) during seed aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Morris et al. have found that two genes, <italic>BoLCVIG1</italic> and <italic>BoLCVIG2,</italic> and a QTL (Reduced ABscisic Acid 1, RABA1) were associated with the determination of seed vigor in <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>, and these genes were associated with ABA metabolism or seed sensitivity to ABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, proteins that are involved in metabolic and protein transport were reduced by artificial aging treatment, whereas actin, mannose-binding lectin superfamily protein, glycosyltransferase, beta-glucosidase and other cell and cell wall structure-related protein content increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies also have shown that the loss of seed vigor during storage in <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds with different oil content is distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, the loss of seed vigor in low oil-containing seeds was significantly lower than that of seeds with high oil content under the same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These results indicate that the seed vigor of rapeseed might be correlated with oil content.</p><p id="Par41">The advent of powerful statistical methods for linkage-based QTLs mapping combined with the available diversity of the germplasm and the completion of reference genome sequencing in <italic>B. napus</italic>, allowing the genetic architecture of complex traits to be uncovered in <italic>B. napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The combination of QTL mapping and multi-omics studies provides a powerful framework for the functional characterization of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For instance, this strategy has been used to identify genes controlling lipid biosynthesis in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this class of approaches, the candidate genes can be narrowed by utilizing multiple datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These results indicate that the identification of candidate genes could be easier and more reliable by combining &#x02018;-omics&#x02019; methods and QTL mapping.</p><p id="Par42">The decreased quality and germination vigor of <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds during long-term storage is a substantial problem. Therefore, improving seed germination vigor and weakening or eliminating the adverse effects of aging on seed germination vigor are related to the improvement of the yield and the quality of the domestic edible oil, which has great significance. This requires a detailed understanding of the regulation mechanism for seed germination and germination vigor in <italic>B. napus</italic>. In this paper, DEPs were observed in the seed germination process of rapeseed lines with high and low oil content, and important candidate genes were identified by combining the QTL analysis for controlling of seed germination vigor in <italic>B. napus</italic>. The results lay the foundation for the ultimate improvement of seed germination vigor and weakening or eliminating the adverse effects of aging on seed germination in <italic>B. napus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of oil content on seed germination vigor in <italic>B. napus</italic></title><p id="Par43">To verify whether the oil content could affect the seed germination vigor, 10 cultivars with high oil content and 10 with low oil content were used for the germination experiment. It was revealed that some seeds began to germinate at 12&#x02009;h after imbibition (HAI), and most had completed germinating at 32 HAI. Further analysis showed that most of cultivars with high oil content could initiate germination more quickly than those with low oil content (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: A), and also that the cultivars with high oil content had a relatively high germination index (GI) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: B). ANOVA analysis was performed to compare the GIs of high and low oil-content materials (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The result presented that the difference in the GI between the two groups was indeed not significant, but the average GI of high oil content materials is clearly higher than that of low oil content materials.

The germination of 12WH191 was much faster than that of KenC8, and the radicle broke through the seed coat as early as 12 HAI in some 12WH191 seeds. In two seeds that germinated after 24 HAI, the radicle protruded from the seed coat and hypocotyl elongation occurred (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After 48 HAI, two examples had started seedling development: the radicle developed into young roots and root hair grew vigorously, cotyledons began to stretch, and the seed coat began to fall off the cotyledons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The moisture of the seeds changed significantly during germination, but there were no significant differences in the trend between the two cultivars (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The water content of the seeds increased rapidly to approximately 40% in the first 12&#x02009;h of germination and then gradually increased to approximately 65% at 36 HAI. Finally, at 48 HAI, the water content increased rapidly to approximately 80%.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of seed germination process between 12WH191 (H) and KenC8 (L). Compared with low oil-content seed, high oil-content seeds showed faster germination and post-germination growth. The seeds were imbibed in water at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C under dark. Photographs were taken at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 HAI. Scale bar represents 1&#x02009;cm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2018_1624_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par45">To evaluate the mobilization of storage reserves in seeds during germination and post-germination, the total oil content was measured (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), and it was revealed that the changing tendency of oil content in germinating KenC8 and 12WH191 seeds was similar, and significant changes only occurred during post-germination seedling growth (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This result suggests that the storage of lipids might be mobilized during germination and are mainly consumed during the post-germination stages. The difference in the relative content of FAs was dramatically observed in these two materials (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In dry seeds, the content of C18:3 in KenC8 was significantly lower than that in 12WH191; otherwise, the content of C18:1 and C18:2 in KenC8 were higher than that in 12WH19. Though some changes of C18:3, C22:1, eicosanoids (C20:0), eicosanoic acid (C20:1) and palmitic acid (C16:0) could be observed in Ken C8 and 12WH191 during germination, the FAs remained relatively stable during germination and post-germination growth.</p><p id="Par46">The changes in protein and sugar content were observed during the germination process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). It was revealed that the total protein content of both KenC8 and 12WH191 increased rapidly after imbibition (0&#x02013;12 HAI) and was followed by a gradual decrease. At 72&#x02009;h, the total protein content of both had been reduced to approximately 30&#x02009;mg/g. This result suggests that in the early stages of germination (0&#x02013;12&#x02009;h), there is a large amount of new protein synthesis in the germinating seed, and a large amount of stored protein is consumed as the source of energy and substance metabolism for seed germination afterwards. In the early stages of germination, the total sugar content in the seeds decreased gradually. The total sugar content of both cultivars increased rapidly following 36 HAI, suggesting that the sugars in the seeds might be the source of energy and substance metabolism required for early seed germination.</p><p id="Par47">Other physiological characteristics that might reflect the physical and metabolic energy use during germination were also determined, including soluble sugar, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). There were no significant differences in the pyruvate content between KenC8 and 12WH191 during germination. In dry seeds, the soluble sugar content in 12WH191 was essentially equal to Ken C8. However, the content of soluble sugar in KenC8 increased rapidly during early germination (0&#x02013;12&#x02009;h) and then decreased gradually, and the soluble sugar content in 12WH191 was always lower than that in KenC8 during germination. The change of acetyl-CoA was nearly same in KenC8 and 12WH191, which gradually decreased in the early stage of germination, and then gradually increased, but began to decrease again after 36 HAI. The content of acetyl-CoA in KenC8 was always lower than that in 12WH191, especially at 0&#x02013;24 HAI. The content of acetyl-CoA in 12WH191 was 2&#x02013;3 times higher than that in KenC8.

In dry seeds, the cotyledon cells of 12WH191 had a smaller the interspace between OBs and thinner cell walls than those of KenC8. Electron-light and small rounded areas were present in the PB matrix (red stars) of 12WH191 and KenC8, but the volume of these inclusions in 12WH191 was relatively larger than those of KenC8 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a and d). No significant changes were observed in 12WH191 and KenC8 after 12 HAI except that the volume and the numbers of inclusions in PBs were reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> b and e). After 24 HAI, significant changes were still not observed in 12WH191, but in KenC8, the electron density of PBs was significantly reduced and became similar to a fibrous granularity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> c and f). This suggests that the storage proteins in seeds of KenC8 had been mobilized and consumed at this stage. After 2&#x02009;days of germination, the PBs in cotyledon cells of 12WH191 and KenC8 both became a vacuole structure and some of the electron-dense inclusions could be observed in these vacuoles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> g and j). These vesicular-like structures had fused after 3&#x02009;days of germination and became a large vacuole located in the center of the cell, and the inclusions could still be observed in the vacuole.

In addition, most of these DEPs were also expressed significantly higher in 12WH191 compared to expression in KenC8 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), such as malate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 1 (spot 808, 816, 892 and 1094) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase 1 (spot 438), which were highly expressed in high oil seedlings at several stages of germination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3 and S5). It was shown that energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolic activity might be significantly higher in 12WH191 than in KenC8, especially in the late stage of germination. In addition, there were 13 DEPs involved in amino acid metabolism, such as glutathione S-transferase (spot 1202, 1204, 1467 and 1709) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase 1 (spot 867), which were highly expressed in germinated 12WH191seeds.</p><p id="Par53">Interestingly, we found that five DEPs (spot 125, 153, 370, 606 and 1108) were involved in signal response and conduction, and besides thioglucoside glucohydrolase 1 (spot 370), other DEPs were significantly higher in germinated seeds of 12WH191 than of KenC8 and reached their peak at 36 or 48 HAI (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S3 and S5).

These DEPs could be divided into six groups (Patterns I-VI; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Pattern V contained only one protein, aldolase-type TIM barrel family protein (spot 991); these DEP was highly expressed in dry seeds and then decreased rapidly and maintained a low expression level during subsequent germination and seedling growth (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table&#x000a0;3 and S5). Patterns I (27) and III (70) represent the DEPs that slightly changed at the early stage of germination, followed by a significant increase in germination and seedling growth. Pattern I peaked at 48 HAI, and the expression peak of Pattern III was at 36 HAI. For example, in the seeds with high oil content, four DEPs that involved amino acid metabolism (spot 1202, 1204, 1467 and 1709, glutamate-cysteine ligase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase 2, mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase 1 and glutathione S-transferase F3) were decreased to the lowest expression level at 12 HAI and then increased rapidly from 24 HAI. However, the expression changes of DEPs in KenC8 lagged behind 12WH191; most expression fell into the lowest point at 24 HAI, and then began to rise rapidly. The same expression pattern was observed in the other DEPs between the two groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Protein metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of sugar and carbohydrates, and stress- and defense-related proteins are the major protein species in the two clusters, indicating that substance and energy metabolism, new protein synthesis, modification and transport, and the construction of a defense system were activated during seed germination. In addition, four signal-related proteins (myrosinase 1, guanosine nucleotide diphosphate dissociation inhibitor 1,14&#x02013;3-3-like protein GF14 kappa and protein low-temperature-induced 65) also appeared in Pattern III. Pattern II (24) represented the DEPs that had fluctuated expression during germination and seedling growth. In this cluster, protein metabolism, defense/disease and storage proteins were three major protein categories. The expression of 12S seed storage protein CRA1 (spot 1286, 1296, 1426 and 1539), cruciferin 2 (spot 1638) and cupin domain-containing protein (spot 249) gradually increased in early germination and then rapidly decreased at a different stage of germination (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Both Pattern IV and Pattern VI indicate DEPs that decreased with germination but fluctuated during post-germination seedling growth, suggesting that these DEPs might play a more important role in the seedling growth stage. For example, some seed maturation proteins (spot 1012, 975, 988, 1132, 1431, 1476 and 528), cell growth and division-related proteins (spot 128 and 1357) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5) followed this pattern. At the same time, the expression patterns of these DEPs were significantly different between 12WH191 and KenC8 during seed germination and post-germination seedling growth, and some protein spots even showed the opposite expression pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The K-mean cluster results of the DEPs.

During the transition from dormancy to germination, the susceptibility of seeds to ABA and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A transcriptional analysis of the wheat seed response to ABA demonstrated that ABA inhibited the germination of wheat seeds by inhibiting chromosome assembly, cell wall modification, and the expression of gibberellin (GA)-metabolic activation-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

The germination rate of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> seeds might be determined by the combination of seed ABA content and seed ABA sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Germination is regulated by the increasing growth potential of the radicle and the resistance of the testa and endosperm tissues covering the radicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Embryo elongation growth requires cell expansion in defined regions of the radicle and the lower hypocotyl, which is promoted by GA and inhibited by ABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The resistance of the surrounding tissues could be reduced by enzymatic or physical weakening of their cell walls. Further, in <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it has been shown that ABA delays endosperm rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis indicated that the content of ABA was higher in KenC8 during early germination (0&#x02013;24 HAI). The endosperm rupture and the cell expansion in the radicle and lower hypocotyl may be delayed by the higher ABA content in <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds with low oil content. In addition, the present results showed that three DEPs, thioglucoside glucohydrolase 1 (spot 370) and protein low-temperature-induced 65 (spot 125 and 153), that associated with ABA-activated signaling pathways differed significantly between 12WH191 and KenC8 during germination. The protein low-temperature-induced 65 was highly expressed in 12WH191 throughout the germination process; otherwise, the expression of thioglucoside glucohydrolase 1 was significantly higher in the KenC8 initially and then it was more highly expressed in 12WH191 during the subsequent germination process. Although there are no reports on the role of thioglucoside glucohydrolase 1 in seed germination, previous studies have shown that it might be involved in ABA-related signaling pathways in leaf-guarding cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

For example, low concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) can enhance the expression of some superoxide dismutase under salt stress. In addition, SA also enhances the re-induction of the late-maturing process in the early stages of germination, the glyoxylate cycle and methionine metabolism, as well as the mobilization of seed storage proteins. All of these SA-affected responses may help to improve the suitability of seeds for the environment and improve seed vigor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The sulfur-containing amino acid metabolic pathway and the myrosinase-glucosinolate system play an important role in plant development and defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The sulfur amino acid metabolic pathway is a key determinant of whether the seed can initiate germination<sup>2</sup>, and inhibition of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism can strongly delay seed germination and seedling growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

Consistent with this result, the high expression of LEA (spot 192, 506, and 528) proteins and HSPs (spot 211, 286 and 292) was identified in the proteomic experiments in the seeds with high oil content and was also detected in the CIs of the QTLs for GP and GI<italic>.</italic> Moreover, many important proteins related to protein synthesis, folding and modification were also highly expressed in the high oil-containing seeds, such as protein disulfide isomerase (spot 428, 432 and 436), chaperonin-60 (spot407 and 411), transcriptional initiation factor 4A-1 (spot 630) and tRNA synthetase (spot 477 and 1576). <italic>AT1G77510</italic> and <italic>AT3G13920</italic> encode protein disulfide isomerase and transcriptional initiation factor 4A-1, respectively, and were identified as located within the CIs of the QTLs for GP and GI.

The glycolytic pathway is necessary for the mobilization of storage reserves during seed germination and is the main source of energy and material required for seed germination and seedling growth.

In the artificial aging of <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds, some metabolic-related proteins are inhibited by aging, which is thought to be associated with the reduction of seed germination vigor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. By comparing the differences in proteomics during the germination of high and low oil-containing seeds, we found that 10 amino acid metabolism-related proteins, 11 sugar and carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins, 15 proteins correlated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism and other energy metabolism processes were highly expressed in the high oil-containing seeds. Some genes corresponding to these DEPs were found to be located in the QTL confidence intervals for GI and GP by the QTL alignment analysis, such as <italic>AT1G79550</italic>, <italic>AT1G77120</italic> and <italic>AT3G48000</italic>, which encode phosphoglycerate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase 1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2B4, respectively. Surprisingly, the total oil content in the dry matter increased significantly at 24 HAI in seeds with both high and low oil content and peaked at 48 and 36 HAI, respectively. A similar result was also observed in germinating jatropha seeds, but no relevant research focused on the mechanism underlying this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Embryo elongation growth requires cell expansion in defined regions of the radicle and lower hypocotyl during early seed germination, while cell division mainly occurs during post-germination seedling growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Large amounts of cell proliferation require the accumulation of phospholipids and may cause lipid metabolism to shift toward lipid regeneration. This requirement may be why the total oil content in dry matter increased significantly at 24 HAI. This increase in oil content was significantly higher in <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds with high oil content, suggesting that cell proliferation may be more exuberant in <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds with high oil content, which was consistent with seedling growth.
