It represents the average value of individual grain weights which depends on position within the ear and on positon within the spikelet. Our objective was to quantify the influences of individual floret anthesis date, of carpel weight at anthesis and of rate and duration of grain filling, on variation in individual final grain weight. Two bread wheat cultivars were grown in a greenhouse and their ears were sampled from anthesis through to harvest. Each ear was divided into three parts&#x02014;basal, central and apical&#x02014;where the two proximal grains were dissected from each of two spikelets. We analysed (i) the flowering time shift within the ear and within the spikelet; and (ii) the growth kinetics during grain filling in relation to position along the ear. For both cultivars, florets located in the central part of the ear were the first to reach anthesis followed by those in the apical part and then the basal part. Within a spikelet, the floret located nearest the rachis flowered first followed by the more distal ones. We found no significant systematic effect of flowering time-shift on final grain weight. Nevertheless, grains in the central part were heavier than the basal ones (9.75% smaller) and than the apical ones (18.25% smaller). These differences were explained mainly by differences in mean grain filling rates. Analysis of growth kinetics enabled an improved explanation of the variability of individual grain weight along the ear.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the general directorate for education and research and the Auvergne regional council.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Grain yield of bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum L</italic>.) can be decomposed into two main components: (i) the number of grains per square meter, which is determined before anthesis and (ii) the thousand grain weight (TGW), which is determined during grain filling. Although grain number per square meter has been identified as the main driver of yield variability [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there is an urgent need to better understand the sources of variation in TGW because climate change may well lead to increases in abiotic stress during grain filling (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]).</p><p>The TGW is generally calculated at the scale of a plot and represents the mean of many individual grain weights. However, wide variability exists in individual grain weight, and this variability has implications for commercial value [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been proposed that part of the genetic improvement of TGW may rely on a putative genetic variability associated with individual grain-weight distribution within the ear [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To pursue a strategy of genetic improvement of TGW based on individual grain-weight variation, requires a better understanding of the ecophysiological mechanisms associated with this variation.</p><p>The final grain weight is determined during grain filling, from anthesis to maturity. Grain filling is considered to occur during three sequential phases of grain development: cell division, grain dry matter accumulation and grain maturation and desiccation [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While the kinetics of grain filling has been described for a number of species, there is still debate as to whether the main driver for final grain weight difference, is the duration of grain filling or the rate of grain filling. Some authors have observed strong correlations between final grain weight and the duration of grain development&#x02014;in corn [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and in durum wheat [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, for pearl millet [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], rice [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and bread wheat [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], differences in final grain weight have been attributed to differences in grain filling rate.</p><p>A weakness of some of these studies is they have focused on specific grains, generally located in the central part of the ear. They have not taken into account developmental variability within the ear and the possible effects of an associated grain-weight distribution. As already noted, significant variability exists in individual grain weight within the ear. This variability originates from two distinct gradients. First, it is generally true that spikelets in the central part of the ear tend to bear heavier grains than those in the basal and apical parts [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Second, differences have also been observed when comparing proximal and distal grains in a spikelet [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the spikelet, the grain weight gradient is also a matter of uncertainty. Some authors report that the second grain in a spikelet is heavier than the proximal grain and also than the more distal ones [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, Herzog and Stamp [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found the proximal grain to be generally heavier than the one in the second position within a spikelet, while Feng et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported no significant weight differences between these positions. However, most of the above studies were largely descriptive and did not propose candidate processes that might explain the observed differences in grain weight.</p><p>Reports that focus on the effects of grain spatial position within the ear on grain growth and employing kinetic growth analysis are scarce and they often lead to conflicting hypotheses. Miralles and Slafer [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that differences in final grain dry matter depended mainly on the rate of grain development and this varied with position in the ear. Bremner [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Herzog and Stamp [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] concluded that both the rate and the duration of grain development were influenced by grain position. Nevertheless, the methods used in these studies do not take into account processes that may be important. In particular, the flowering time of each floret and the carpel weight at anthesis were not taken into account as putative co-variables. For example, individual grain flowering time is subject to the same two gradients as described above. Thus Rawson and Evans [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] show that florets in the centre of the ear reach anthesis first, followed by the more distal florets, one day later, and then the more proximal florets, three days later. Moreover, within a spikelet, as many as four days can elapse between the anthesis of the first and last florets [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, carpel size also affects final grain weight, with carpel size within spikelets in the central part of the ear being positively correlated with final grain weight [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A recent study also showed that the larger the carpel, the faster the rates of grain growth and grain filling, these resulting in heavier grains [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, these studies did not correlate spikelet position along the ear with carpel size. Carpel size differences may well be a cause of the grain weight differences found in different parts of the ear.</p><p>Thus, although the literature offers good information on the spatial variability of individual grain weight within the ear and on the growth dynamics of specific grains, it lack more detailed analyses of grain growth dynamics in different regions of the ear and of the spikelet. Only a few studies attempt this [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but the methods did not allow robust statistical comparison to be made of the kinetic parameters of grains in the different ear parts.</p><p>Our objective was to identify the factors determining individual grain weight variation both along the ear and within the spikelet by measuring four major traits: the timing of floret anthesis, the carpel weight at anthesis, and the rate and duration of grain development. To do this we characterised the growth dynamics of grains located in different parts of the ear using two cultivars of greenhouse-grown bread wheat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We selected two winter wheat cultivars registered in France known to differ in grain yield and its components from a field experiment conducted in 2014 in Clermont-Ferrand, France (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209597.s006">S1 Table</xref>).

On average for Renan, over all spikelet positions, the delay was 18&#x000b0;Cdays<sup>-1</sup> for floret 2 and 48&#x000b0;Cdays<sup>-1</sup> for floret 3.

In Renan, the period was 3.0 days and the interval was 1.6 days.</p><p>As described above, the dynamics of grain growth as the accumulation of dry matter per grain was not recorded for all grains but only for the proximal two grains (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>) of spikelets inserted in the basal, distal and apical parts of the ear. The presence of grains in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> positions in the spikelet (Apache) and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> position (Renan) was not sufficiently common in the basal and apical parts of the ear for their growth to be analysed. For consistency with this sampling pattern, the flowering time dynamics was analysed following this same pattern. An ANOVA was carried out for each cultivar but only on the two proximal florets within the two spikelets (i.e. four florets) in the basal, central and apical parts of the ear. The results show flowering time is significantly related to spikelet position (p&#x0003c;0.01 for Apache and p&#x0003c;0.001 for Renan) and to floret position (p&#x0003c;0.05 for both cultivars) within the ear. No significant interaction was detected which indicates the two gradients are simply additive in their effects.

The aim was to identify the main parameters driving variability in final grain weight.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Duration of flowering within an ear</title><p>For both cultivars under our experimental conditions, the results show that about 120&#x000b0;Cdays (about 5.5 days) were required for all fertile florets within the ear to reach flowering. This agrees with previous studies which reported intervals of from 2 to 6 days for this [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This finding raises the question of the differential effects of any abiotic or biotic stresses that may occur at the single grain scale around the time of anthesis. This is particularly the case for stresses whose physiological effects will depend strongly on timing. For example, Prasad and Djanaguiraman [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] demonstrated that a high temperature stress (35/25&#x000b0;C, day/night) applied at 6 or at 4 days before flowering, resulted in a two-fold variation in floret fertility. Clearly such a strong effect will significantly impact grain number per m<sup>2</sup>. However, it will also likely affect individual grain growth, and this response will depend on the developmental stage at the time of the stress event.</p><p>The 5.5 day time period over which the entire flowering of a single ear takes place, should be considered in relation to the conditions of our study. Here, only the ears originating from the main tillers were studied, also our plants were grown at a lower density than generally applies in the field. Nevertheless, Willenborg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] observed a similar range of within-ear flowering times for four different wheat cultivars under field conditions. De Vries [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] studied flowering times on up to three ears per plant, in five spring-wheat varieties under greenhouse conditions. While the main ear flowered between 2 and 4 days before the two secondary ears, the authors did not report differences in the range of flowering times within each of the different classes. Clearly, the duration of complete flowering in a single ear observed in our study, is similar to those observed in the field. It is also greater than that observed between the 2&#x02013;3 larger ears, usually present in a field-grown wheat plant. This indicates that intra-ear and/or intra-spikelet variability in flowering time is a major source of total variability.</p><p>Our results show this timing variability is spatially structured and follows the axial (vertical) and lateral (horizontal) gradients in a wheat ear. This finding agrees with those of the only two earlier studies, made from a similar perspective [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The putative effects of flowering time shift on final grain weight will now be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Distribution of individual final grain weight according to the spikelet position along the ear</title><p>One of the aims of our study was to characterise the differences in final grain weight in relation to the two ear gradients&#x02013;vertical and horizontal. As regards the two proximal grains within a spikelet (horizontal gradient), previous studies have yielded contrasting results. Some authors who worked only on grains located in the central spikelets observed heavier grains in the second position [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Meanwhile, others found the second grain was generally heavier than the first but with an interaction with spikelet position in the ear [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that the higher weight of the second grain is particularly marked in spikelets localised in the central position of the ear. Based on a study of three wheat cultivars, Herzog and Stamp [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] observed that a &#x02018;standard&#x02019; wheat cultivar (as opposed to a semi-dwarf or an oligoculm cultivar) produced heavier grains in the proximal position within a spikelet. However, Feng et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found no difference in final grain weight between the two proximal grains of a spikelet in five wheat cultivars grown under field conditions. Our results are consistent with the latter result, since we found neither final grain weight nor growth kinetic differences between the two proximal grains. And this observation was independent of spikelet position along the ear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209597.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Because we found no significant difference in grain weight between the two proximal grains of a spikelet, we pooled these in further analyses of grain growth in terms of spikelet position along the ear. In other words, our study was restricted to the effects of the vertical gradient.</p><p>The variability of final grain weight in relation to spikelet position along the ear has been described in different ways by different authors. Some have presented values of individual grain weight from each spikelet. In these, the average final grain weight per spikelet was found to follow a parabolic pattern along the ear with higher values in the middle spikelets [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. More commonly, results have been presented based on subdivisions of the ear (as we have). This allows statistical comparison between the subdivisions. Of these studies, two reported heavier grains in spikelets in the central part of the ear but could not distinguish between apical and basal ear parts that both bore smaller grains [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Other authors reported similar grain weights in the central and basal parts while grain weights were significantly lower only in the apical part [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our results agree with Bremner [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who recorded the average weight of the two proximal grains and with Miralles and Slafer [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who recorded the weight only of the grain nearest the rachis. In our results, we identified statistically significant differences between the three different ear parts&#x02013;the heaviest grains were in the central part, lighter grains were in the basal part and lighter grains still were in the apical part (<xref rid="pone.0209597.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Relationship between flowering time shift of individual florets and final grain weight</title><p>Given the general similarity between the gradient of flowering and that of final grain weight, one might hypothesise a causal relationship between the two. Under this hypothesis it would seem reasonable to assume the earliest grains might benefit from lower competition for metabolites during early grain filling while only a few grains are actively developing. However, we could detect no systematic effect of flowering time shift on final grain weight. Indeed, in neither cultivar did the flowering-time difference between the first and second florets, result in a grain-weight difference, in any of the three ear parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209597.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0209597.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Also, in Renan there were no differences in flowering time between the central and apical parts of the ear (<xref rid="pone.0209597.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, significantly heavier grains were found in the central part (<xref rid="pone.0209597.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We thus conclude it is unlikely the differences in final grain weight between ear parts originate from a flowering time shift. The cause of the grain weight difference between ear parts would thus seem to arise from different grain growth kinetics in each part.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Relationship between grain growth traits and final grain weight along the ear</title><p>We studied three parameters: initial grain weight, and the duration and rate of grain filling. Hazan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Calderini et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] hypothesised that initial grain weight at flowering (evaluated as carpel weight) is a major determinant of final grain weight. Our results do not particularly support this hypothesis, as no significant correlation (at a 5% level) between the two variables was detected for the different ear parts (r = 0.72, p = 0.11 for Apache and r = 0.52, p = 0.30 for Renan). This suggests the two other parameters may be of greater influence. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of an indirect effect of initial grain weight on final grain weight, mediated by one of these two other parameters as discussed further below.</p><p>A number of growth kinetics studies have been conducted on average grains sampled at maturity from the central spikelets of an ear. Using different bread wheat genotypes and environments, these show that the rate of grain filling during the linear phase had a stronger effect on final grain weight than the duration of grain filling [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, very few studies have considered the differences in grain growth kinetics based on spikelet position along the ear. For Bremner [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as for Herzog and Stamp [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the duration of grain filling was associated with the differences in final grain weight observed between the different parts of the ear. Conversely, Miralles and Slafer [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] did not find any association between the two variables. Our results are consistent with the latter authors, since we found no correlation between final grain weight and grain filling duration. It is worth noting that calculating grain filling durations from logistic curves, led to low precisions in our estimates, with standard errors of between 30 and 90&#x000b0;Cdays (<xref rid="pone.0209597.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our study revealed an effect of mean grain filling rate in the determinism of final grain weight differences along the ear. In both our cultivars, the mean grain filling rate in the central part of the ear was 11% higher than in the basal part, and 16% higher than in the apical part. Similar results have been found previously although no statistical comparisons were reported between the different parts of the ear [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Different physiological hypotheses explaining grain filling rate differences along the ear</title><p>A number of physiological hypotheses have been proposed to explain differences in grain filling rate along the ear. Xie et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] pooled data from several genotypes and floret positions and found significant relationships between the initial grain weight at flowering and the rates of grain growth during both the lag phase and also during the linear phase of grain filling. This relationship could be the result of grains with higher carpel weights at flowering having higher sink strengths. We found for both cultivars that grains located in the central part of the ear had larger initial weights and also higher mean grain-filling rates. However, we also found different mean rates of grain growth in apical and basal ears parts in Apache and in central and basal parts in Renan, even though the initial grain weights were not significantly different. Even if these comparisons are qualitative in nature, they do not indicate a strong effect of initial grain weight on grain filling rate, at least when considered independently of ear part.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis to explain the different grain-filling rates along the ear may be linked to the activity of specific hormones within the grain. The importance of hormonal regulation in grain development has often been stressed, particularly in wheat (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209597.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). More importantly, several authors have shown the importance of hormonal gradients in reproductive structures and their possible link with vertical gradients of grain/seed size. Thus, working with three rice hybrids, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that the low rate of filling in grains in inferior spikelets, is linked to low numbers of endosperm cells and to low contents of ABA, cytokinin and auxin during early grain filling.</p><p>A further possibility is that the structure of the ear vascular system could also contribute to differences in grain-filling rate along the ear. Whingwiri et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that the numbers and diameters of vascular bundles decreased from the base to the tip of the ear. Thus, assimilate transport may be more limited in spikelets located near the tip of the ear. They also found that the spikelets at the base of the ear were supplied by branching bundles&#x02013;branching could reduce assimilate supply. Meanwhile, spikelets in the central part of the ear are supplied by unbranched and larger bundles that may offer less resistance to assimilate transport [<xref rid="pone.0209597.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that individual grain weights are greatest in the central part of the ear, less in the apical part and intermediate in the basal part. These differences do not originate from a flowering time shift. However, two results are worth noticing about this study of flowering time: (i) about 5.5 days was required for all fertile florets in an ear to reach flowering; (ii) no interaction was found between the flowering time shifts within the ear, and within the spikelet. Thus, these differences of final grain weight along the ear were due mainly to differences in average grain filling rate. Unlike some other studies, we did not find clear evidence for an effect of initial grain weight on either final grain weight or on average grain filling rate.</p><p>A better understanding of the factors contributing to average grain filling rate and to final grain weight will be useful if we are to increase individual grain weights in the apical and basal parts of the ear while maintaining those in the central part. This understanding will be particularly valuable in the context of climate change, which indicate an increased occurrence of unfavourable growing conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Daily averages of environmental values recorded every 15 min from anthesis to maturity.</title><p>A: Air temperature, B: Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), C: Relative humidity.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209597.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Frequency of floret presence according to position within the ear and spikelet for cultivars Apache (A) and Renan (B).</bold> Ten ears were scored with 22 spikelets for Apache and with 20 spikelets for Renan.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209597.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of grain position on (a) the final grain weight and (b) the mean rate of grain filling for cultivars Apache (A) and Renan (B).</bold> Black dot: atypical observations, black square: mean of the trait calculated on between 24 and 39 replicates.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209597.s003.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of thermal time (&#x000b0;Cdays, base 0&#x000b0;C) on the standardised residuals from the adjusted model against observed values of grain weight.</title><p>A three-parameter logistic model was fitted to each cultivar, to three ear parts and to four blocks.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209597.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>The relationship between grain dry weight and thermal time after anthesis for the three different ear parts, the four blocks and for cultivars Apache and Renan.</title><p>Light grey circle: apical part, dark grey circle: basal part, black circle: central part.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209597.s005.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209597.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of mean yield components between the two wheat cultivars grown in the field in 2014 and in the greenhouse in 2017.</title><p>Values are means and standard deviations (SD) calculated over eight replicates for 2014 and over seven replicates for 2017.
