    "The ongoing global intensification of wheat production will likely be accompanied by a rising pressure of Fusarium diseases. While utmost attention was given to Fusarium head blight (FHB) belowground plant infections of the pathogen have largely been ignored. The current knowledge about the impact of soil borne Fusarium infection on plant performance and the underlying genetic mechanisms for resistance remain very limited. Here, we present the first large-scale investigation of Fusarium root rot (FRR) resistance using a diverse panel of 215 international wheat lines. We obtained data for a total of 21 resistance-related traits, including large-scale Real-time PCR experiments to quantify fungal spread. Association mapping and subsequent haplotype analyses discovered a number of highly conserved genomic regions associated with resistance, and revealed a significant effect of allele stacking on the stembase discoloration. Resistance alleles were accumulated in European winter wheat germplasm, implying indirect prior selection for improved FRR resistance in elite breeding programs. Our results give first insights into the genetic basis of FRR resistance in wheat and demonstrate how molecular parameters can successfully be explored in genomic prediction. Ongoing work will help to further improve our understanding of the complex interactions of genetic factors influencing FRR resistance."
