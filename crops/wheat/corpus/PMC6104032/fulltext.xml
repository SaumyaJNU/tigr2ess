We used next-generation sequencing, together with multi-environment phenotyping, to study the contribution of exotic genomes to 984 three-way-cross-derived (exotic/elite1//elite2) pre-breeding lines (PBLs). Genomic characterization of these lines with haplotype map-based and SNP marker approaches revealed exotic specific imprints of 16.1 to 25.1%, which compares to theoretical expectation of 25%. A rare and favorable haplotype (GT) with 0.4% frequency in gene bank identified on chromosome 6D minimized grain yield (GY) loss under heat stress without GY penalty under irrigated conditions. More specifically, the &#x02018;T&#x02019; allele of the haplotype GT originated in <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> and was absent in all elite lines used in study. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the SNP showed hits with a candidate gene coding for <italic>isoflavone reductase</italic> IRL-like protein in <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>. Rare haplotypes were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 6A and 2B effective against abiotic/biotic stresses. Results demonstrate positive contributions of exotic germplasm to PBLs derived from crosses of exotics with CIMMYT&#x02019;s best elite lines. This is a major impact-oriented pre-breeding effort at CIMMYT, resulting in large-scale development of PBLs for deployment in breeding programs addressing food security under climate change scenarios.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The twentieth century witnessed the impact of traditional breeding methods in enhancing genetic gains for wheat grain yield (GY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the pre-Green Revolution period, breeding efforts relied on selection from locally adapted landraces or traditional cultivars, but a paradigm shift occurred with the extensive use of semi-dwarf wheat cultivars beginning during the Green Revolution. Further, the development and use of synthetic wheats in breeding brought diverse alleles from the tertiary gene pool into varietal pipelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These and other advances in breeding enabled annual genetic gains for GY between 0.6 and 1.0 percent for varieties released between 1994 and 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, rates of gain must increase to meet the food and nutrition demand of our growing global population under the likely, unfavorable climate change scenarios.</p><p id="Par3">The impact of landraces, wild relatives and synthetic wheats on genetic gains for GY, by providing resistance against biotic stresses, and to a much lesser extent against abiotic stresses, is well recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, breeders are generally reluctant to use exotic genetic resources because of the long-term commitment required to identify useful, novel diversity and introgress it into well-adapted elite cultivars while reducing the effects of undesired, linked genes. A commonly reported, intriguing analogy, is that the &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; parent of good&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;bad crosses often contributes one or more QTL with favorable effects on the trait of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Approximately 800,000 wheat accessions, including landraces and synthetics, exist in germplasm banks globally as reservoirs of useful alleles for breeding, but only a very small proportion of these have been used in varietal improvement programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Low-cost high-density genomics and growing bioinformatics capacity are increasing the feasibility of identifying and using the &#x0201c;diamonds in the rough&#x0201d; within these genetic resources.</p><p id="Par4">Pre-breeding, or the development of &#x0201c;half-way&#x0201d; germplasm introgressing exotic (unimproved) into elite germplasm, plays a key role in broadening the genetic base of breeding germplasm pools. Pre-breeding programs that create freely available, pre-competitive, bridging or intermediate germplasm by introgressing desirable genes from exotic into elite lines empower breeding programs to use germplasm bank diversity cost effectively. Realizing this, a few wheat pre-breeding projects have been launched<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. CIMMYT&#x02019;s Seeds of Discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> is an innovative project initiated to use next generation genome sequencing technology, envirotyping and analytical methods to characterize and enhance the use of germplasm bank accessions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This is the third major germplasm infusion effort at CIMMYT that has resulted in strategic development of large-scale pre-breeding germplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) followed by its deployment through breeding pipelines. Useful and novel diversity for stress tolerance (heat, drought, yellow rust and powdery mildew) and quality (zinc concentration) was introgressed to lines derived from crosses of exotics with CIMMYT&#x02019;s best elite wheat germplasm. Concomitantly, this research identified rare haplotypes effective against abiotic or biotic stresses contributed from exotics through haplotypes-based genome wide association study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed and reported wheat pre-breeding schemes. Germplasm bank accessions are genotyped while field and laboratory phenotyping is performed for various traits using sub-sets or core sub-sets of accessions. Genotypic and phenotypic information are used to form core subsets for phenotyping. Once trait donors are identified, these are used for crossing with elite lines (exotic/elite1//elite2), followed by selection under heat, drought and disease conditions during TC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> to TC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>5</sub> generations.

If we include 6.9% missing markers in these calculations, an average of 23.4% of SNP markers were inherited from their exotic parent, 65.9% from elite parents and 3.8% were heterozygous. These frequencies correspond closely with expectations of 25% exotic and 75% elite alleles for a TC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>5</sub> (top cross) population. Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> illustrates exotic- and elite-specific imprints in genomes of PBLs in the analyzed crosses. Chromosome 2A, for example, had a region where alleles appeared to be preferentially inherited from the elite parents, while chromosomes 3B and 5B had segments where alleles from exotic parents prevailed in the PBLs. It will be interesting to study these genomic regions in depth to increase our understanding of preferential accumulation of exotic and elite specific alleles in these PBLs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Haplotype-Trait Associations</title><p id="Par7">The genome wide association (GWA) analysis identified HBs significantly associated with grain yield (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and disease resistances under multiple environments (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5A,B</xref>).

The GY advantage associated with favorable alleles in HBs 8.22, 18.1, and 19.24 may be due to increased biomass as these showed positive associations with both biomass and GY (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Detailed dissection of these HBs revealed that HBs 8.22 and 19.24 increased biomass without affecting harvest index, and hence might have positive effect on other yield component(s). A closer HB to HB18.1 on chromosome 6D i.e. HB 18.2 (within 5&#x02009;cM of HB18.1) showed association with thousand kernel weight (TKW) and a minor haplotype AC (present in 6% of PBLs) was favorable resulting in an average TKW of 47.6&#x02009;g (4.5 to 6% more TKW than remaining two haplotypes; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Thus, HB18.1 seems to increase GY via increase in both biomass and TKW.

More specifically, the &#x02018;T&#x02019; allele of haplotype GT was absent in all elite parents studied here, whereas it was present in the exotic (synthetic) parents and their derived PBLs. Following this discovery, we screened 62,000 previously sequenced CIMMYT germplasm bank accessions for the presence of this favorable haplotype and found it in only 262 (0.42%) accessions.

This approach is successful to improve specific trait and are being used in most breeding programs. However, in this investigation, exotics alleles were first brought into elite backgrounds and then useful alleles were selected. We pursued a three-way cross strategy (exotic/elite<sub>1</sub>//elite<sub>2</sub>) to generate PBLs, in a way so that each PBL possessed approximately 25% of the exotic and 75% of the elite genomes at an early stage. Therefore, exotic alleles were incorporated into elite backgrounds even before their trait values were identified. This strategy enabled investigation of greater number of genetic variants at a time and also allowed recombination between exotic and elite genomes to be exploited for genetic improvement of elites. Further, bulk selection in subsequent segregating generations (TC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> to TC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>5</sub>) helped in capturing maximum useful diversity. In addition, HB analysis suggests that this strategy retained rare and useful allelic variation. The simultaneous evaluation of the derived germplasm at multiple locations ensured minimum loss of useful diversity, identify useful, and novel diversity into well-adapted regional elite cultivars. The agronomic competitiveness of many PBLs with elite check lines further indicates that this approach addressed the bottlenecks of undesirable drag, possibly by breakage of haplotype blocks and thereby selection of useful alleles or interaction of exotic with elite alleles.</p><p id="Par23">The &#x02018;Seeds of Discovery&#x02019; project has used more than 1,000 exotic accessions to develop PBLs that have entered product pipelines in several breeding programs in India, Pakistan, UK, Brazil, Kenya, Australia, Canada Turkey, and Mexico (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5C</xref>).

The present research elaborates the exhaustive efforts taken by SeeD (starting with 400,000 initial segregating pre-breeding lines) to bring in the untapped diversity of wheat exotics in gene bank into PBLs. CIMMYT provided first research breakthrough by providing semi-dwarf materials to the global research community. Followed by this, second generation germplasms were provided by CIMMYT i.e. synthetics. This is the third major impact-oriented germplasm infusion effort that has resulted in strategic development of large-scale pre-breeding germplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) followed by its deployment through breeding programs. Further, the use of high-density genotyping, in combination with multi-location phenotyping for a set of agronomic and stress tolerance traits, enabled the quantification of significant and positive genomic contributions from exotic wheat germplasm to progenies of their three-way crosses with pairs of elite wheat lines. The three-way crosses, followed by mild selection for essential agronomic traits during generation advancement, effectively captured many minor haplotypes from exotic germplasm bank accessions in the resultant progeny PBLs. The donors identified for heat, drought, and disease resistances, and for enhanced grain zinc concentration (up to 58&#x02009;ppm), along with rare exotic haplotypes associated with the traits, demonstrated the important role that exotic germplasm can play in improvement of wheat elite lines globally. Under the worsening climate change scenarios and the anticipated threats of new emerging diseases for instance, wheat blast emergence in Bangladesh, the bridging germplasm created here can serve as a handy germplasm for both screening resistance donors and identification of candidate genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par25">Twenty-five elite CIMMYT wheat lines were used for developing pre-breeding germplasm.
