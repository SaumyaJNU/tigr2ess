    "Although kernel weight (KW) is a major component of grain yield, its contribution to yield genetic gain during breeding history has been minimal. This highlights an untapped potential for further increases in yield via improving KW. We investigated variation and genetics of KW and kernel length (KL) via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a historical and contemporary soft red winter wheat population representing 200 years of selection and breeding history in the United States. The observed changes of KW and KL over time did not show any conclusive trend. The population showed a structure, which was mainly explained by the time and location of germplasm development. Cluster sharing by germplasm from more than one breeding population was suggestive of episodes of germplasm exchange. Using 2 years of field-based phenotyping, we detected 26 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for KW and 27 QTL for KL with -log10(p) > 3.5. The search for candidate genes near the QTL on the wheat genome version IWGSCv1.0 has resulted in over 500 genes. The predicted functions of several of these genes are related to kernel development, photosynthesis, sucrose and starch synthesis, and assimilate remobilization and transport. We also evaluated the effect of allelic polymorphism of genes previously reported for KW and KL by using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers. Only TaGW2 showed significant association with KW. Two genes, i.e., TaSus2-2B and TaGS-D1 showed significant association with KL. Further physiological studies are needed to decipher the involvement of these genes in KW and KL development."
