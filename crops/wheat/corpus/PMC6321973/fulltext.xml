There are two major types of cultivated wheat; one is tetraploid durum (pasta) wheat and another one is hexaploid bread wheat. Wheat grain is the reservoir of two major dietary components &#x02013; carbohydrate and protein, which get accumulated during seed maturation and directly affects yield and quality. Hexaploid, having 6 copies of each chromosome differs to a great extent from tetraploid having 4 copies of each chromosome. Studying the gene expression pattern in developing grain would help in understanding the difference in metabolic process as well as involvement of the genes in these two types of wheat. A transcriptional comparison of developing grains was carried out between the two wheat genotypes; tetraploid (AABB:PDW233) and hexaploid (AABBDD:PBW343) using RNA-seq. Approximately 194 million raw reads were obtained from both libraries. After removal of contaminations, a huge proportion (&#x0003e;99%), of high quality reads were obtained, were aligned to reference genome. A total of 2324 up-regulated and 522 down-regulated genes were identified as differentially expressed between PDW233 vs PBW343. Gene ontology annotation and enrichment analysis gave further information about differentially expressed genes between durum and bread wheat. This information will help in understanding process grain reserve in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat in relation to their nutritional quality.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hexaploid bread wheat</kwd><kwd>Tetraploid durum wheat</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Grain development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications table</bold><table-wrap id="t0015" position="float"><alt-text id="at0025">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Subject area</th><th>Biology</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td>Transcriptomics</td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td>Transcriptome sequences</td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td>Illumina HiSeq. 2000</td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td>Raw data (FASTQ)</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td>RNA was isolated during grain development</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td>Datasets for hexaploid bread wheat and tetraploid durum wheat</td></tr><tr><td>Sample source location</td><td>New Delhi, India</td></tr><tr><td>Data accessibility</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/503549" id="ir0005">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/503549</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0010"><bold>Value of the data</bold><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">This is transcriptome analysis of two wheat genotypes i.e., tetraploid durum wheat (AABB: PDW233) and hexaploid bread wheat (AABBDD: PBW343) using RNA-seq.

Among these, a large number of genes involved in starch synthesis were detected in our results. Starch synthesis genes were found to be up-regulated in (PBW343), which is the key enzymes in the process of starch synthesis. We found that the genes encoding sucrose synthase (SUSY) <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> which converts sucrose into fructose and glucose were up-regulated with more than +2.9 to 5.7-log<sub>2</sub>-fold in hexaploid wheat compared with AABB genotypes during starch accumulation. Genes involved in the biological process of response to stress, polysaccharide metabolism, multi-organism processes, and the biological function of nutrient reservoir and hydrolase activities were up-regulated in hexaploid wheat compared with AABB genotypes. In the present study, we also identified several important enzyme families, such as peroxidases, (Peroxidases play many roles in plant seeds, such as removing noxious H2O2, facilitating seed maturation by inhibiting IAA activity, and promoting ethylene synthesis) methyltransferases (methyltransferases are responsible for amino transfer, which plays an important role in amino acid synthesis and protein synthesis). Up-regulation of all of these enzymes are critical for successful seed development. Superoxide dismutase is the defense protein showed of +3.98-log<sub>2</sub> fold up-regulation in hexaploid wheat (AABBDD) compared to tetraploid wheat (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Differentially expressed transcripts between (AABB: PDW233) vs (AABBDD: PBW343).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Total up and down regulated genes (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) found using Cuffdiff analysis.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0020">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">(AABB:PDW233) vs (AABBDD:PBW343)</td><td>Up-regulated</td><td>Down-regulated</td></tr><tr><td>2324</td><td>522</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>GO enrichment analyses of transcripts found in (AABB:PDW233) vs (AABBDD:PBW343) Agri GO analysis (red higher, yellow lower).
