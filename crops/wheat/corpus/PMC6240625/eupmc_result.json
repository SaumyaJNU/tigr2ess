    "The seed details (weight, vigor) and germination rate of 16 wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes in a non-limiting conditions were measured. The dataset presents seed germination rate and seed vigor of 16 wheat genotypes. The dataset also presents the concentrations of the cations to create solution treatments of various sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and ionic strength (I). Finally, dataset presented a figure of the experimental design to measure seedling emergence force of wheat genotypes. The image of the setup and the relation between strain and force have been presented here to convert the strain of the beam into seedling emergence force. This dataset has been used in research work titled 'Greater emergence force and hypocotyl cross sectional area may improve wheat seedling emergence in sodic conditions' (Anzooman et al., 2018) [1]."
