In 2016, scientists confirmed the presence of the devastating wheat-blast disease in Bangladesh, South Asia&#x02013;its first occurrence outside South America. Severely blast-affected wheat fields had their grain yield wiped out. This poses a severe threat to food security in a densely-populated region with millions of poor inhabitants where wheat is a major staple crop and per capita wheat consumption has been increasing. As an <italic>ex ante</italic> impact assessment, this study examined potential wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Based on the agro-climatic conditions in the epicenter, where the disease was first identified in Bangladesh in 2016, this study identified the correspondingly vulnerable areas in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh amounting to 7 million ha. Assuming a conservative scenario of 5&#x02013;10% for blast-induced wheat production loss, this study estimated the annual potential wheat loss across the sampled countries to be 0.89&#x02013;1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132&#x02013;264 million. Such losses further threaten an already-precarious national food security, putting pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices. The study is a call for action to tackle the real wheat-blast threat in South Asia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CGIAR research program on WHEAT agro-food systems</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3392-4176</contrib-id><name><surname>Kruseman</surname><given-names>Gideon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>CIM/2016/170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Pawan Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This paper was supported by the CGIAR research program on WHEAT agro-food systems to GK and Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) CIM/2016/170 to PKS.

Additionally, new biotic stresses have emerged around the globe over the last decades, threatening food safety and production and overall food security in developing countries.</p><p>In 2016, the devastating wheat-blast disease caused by the fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> pathotype <italic>Triticum</italic> (MoT) was reported in Bangladesh, South Asia [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is a significant incident. First, it represents the first occurrence outside South America of this particularly aggressive disease. Second, it entered South Asia, where wheat is a major staple for the masses. In 2016, it was believed to be confined to Bangladesh, a densely-populated, land scarce country with nearly 160 million people, of which 18% are extremely poor, living on less than USD 1.90 day<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2017, wheat-blast-like symptoms were unofficially reported for the first time from eastern India in various newspapers [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although it has not been officially confirmed these disease symptoms were blast, the likelihood of wheat blast passing across the Bangladesh border is high. Bangladesh shares a border of 2,217 kilometers only with West Bengal, India, which cuts across the lower part of the Gangetic plains. This is an immense contiguous densely-populated and intensively cultivated area that stretches from Bangladesh to adjacent West Bengal up to north-western India and on to the Indus plains of Pakistan, home to the rice-wheat systems and the staple basket for much of South Asia [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Wheat blast was first reported in the Parana state of Brazil in 1985 [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Later it spread to the humid and warmer zones of Bolivia, Paraguay and north-eastern Argentina [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The disease is so destructive that it reduced wheat yield in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2005 by 14&#x02013;32%, even after two applications of fungicides [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In Bangladesh, in February 2016, wheat blast affected nearly 15,000 ha (3.5% of the total 0.43 million ha of wheat area in Bangladesh), with wheat yields in the affected fields reduced by 5&#x02013;51% [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Any spread of wheat blast into the rest of Bangladesh and particularly into India and Pakistan, could wreak havoc on wheat production in South Asia and significantly threaten food security and the overall well-being of a region with millions of poor wheat consumers who depend on wheat as their main source of dietary energy.</p><p>The objective of this study was to examine wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan by applying an <italic>ex ante</italic> impact assessment framework to quantify the potential impacts in South Asia&#x02019;s wheat areas, which are potentially vulnerable to wheat-blast considering their favorable climate for the disease. This study intends to inform stakeholders of the wheat-blast threat in South Asia and assess the implications.</p><p>The study is organized as follows: the next section gives a brief perspective on the spread of wheat blast, its causes and implications; Section 3 includes the materials and methods section, including the selection of wheat blast hotspots, the current status of land allocation to wheat and wheat yield in the selected regions of the sampled countries; Section 4 presents simulation results and Section 5 concludes and provides recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Wheat-blast disease</title><p>Wheat blast is usually classified as a spike disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197555.g002">Fig 2</xref>). It can be found on all the aerial plant parts of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], although leaf infection is seen only in highly-susceptible varieties [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Spike infection is the most notable symptom of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is often confused with Fusarium head blight (FHB) infection; but rather than attacking individual spikelets and conferring a salmon or pinkish tint to flames as FHB usually does, blast attacks the rachis, leading to bleached spikelets above the point of infection and bright black spots on the rachis [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Grains from blast-infected heads are usually small, shriveled, deformed, and have low-test weight. The highest yield losses happen when head infections start during anthesis or early grain development stages [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0197555.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0197555.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Wheat-blast symptoms in Jhenaidah district, Bangladesh in February 2017.</title><p><bold>Panel A: Infected spikes; Panel B: Infected field.</bold> Courtesy: Moksedul A. Arafat, Technical Officer, Jessore Hub, CIMMYT, Bangladesh, 2017.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0197555.g002"/></fig><p>The wheat-blast pathogen emerged only 32 years ago in South America, but has fully adapted to its new host &#x02012; wheat &#x02012; and continues to spread and evolve genetically. The first occurrence of this biotic stress outside South America represents a major event which, in turn, may trigger a new selection pressure, from the Bangladesh outbreak epicenter, on this highly-evolving fungus. Although the comparative genome analysis showed that isolates from diverse wheat regions in Bangladesh appeared clonal [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and pathogenomics analysis [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] confirmed that the Bangladeshi wheat-blast most likely arrived from South America, a change in pathogen population can be expected due to a new environment and hosts selection pressure. Bangladesh and South Asian agro-ecology, as well as the host wheat germplasm and weeds are quite different from that of South America. These differences will put different selection pressures on the pathogen and the fungus will likely evolve and cope with the new environment, which can trigger a new selection pressure in the pathogen population. Importantly, the strain identified in Bangladesh corresponds to a very aggressive type compared to <italic>MoT</italic> strains collected in the early days of observation when the disease was considered an oddity, unable to cause large and frequent epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, wheat blast is a seed-borne disease [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and could potentially spread due to seed sharing between farmers, as frequently observed in South Asia, and with wheat trade between countries. Moreover, it is also airborne [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and can move relatively long distances during the cropping season. The 2016 detection of the wheat-blast in Bangladesh could thus spread further into India and Pakistan, not least as Bangladesh shares a long border with India. In 2017, unofficial media reported that spikes with wheat-blast-like symptoms had been observed in West Bengal, adjoining the western borders of Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>At present, most of the commercially-grown wheat cultivars in South Asia are susceptible to wheat blast. Although some cultivars tolerant or moderately resistant to wheat blast have been identified in localized geographic areas, no durable resistant cultivar has been developed until today [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The level of yield losses and speed of epidemics caused by <italic>MoT</italic> along with the lack of resistance may require innovative approaches to manage this disease. Generally, the known fungicides are ineffective under high disease pressure, and were only partially effective under moderate to low infection of the wheat-blast isolates in Brazil [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, the pathogen has shown a rapid ability to develop resistance to certain classes of fungicides [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0197555.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Still, there remains a role for protectant low risk fungicides, also as the pathogen's evolution reflects the distinct selection pressure exerted by long term use of high risk fungicides (e.g. QoIs, DMIs or SDHIs as the sole molecule). Indeed, the wheat-blast isolate in Bangladesh was effectively controlled with Tebuconazole and Trifloxystrobin, which is widely available in South Asia [Malakar, personal communication]. Nevertheless, the list of approved and locally available fungicides in South Asia is limited and, therefore, testing the active-ingredient efficacy is required. At present isolated incidences of fields affected by wheat-blast-like symptoms are dealt with by burning the standing crop. This destructive method of dealing with the disease can lead to severe production shortfalls if the disease becomes more pervasive. Moreover, in addition to similar agro-climatic conditions across Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the changing global climate and the evolving pathogen (e.g. increasing aggressiveness, fungicide resistance and sexual recombination) can further aggravate disease incidence with the likely expansion to other major wheat-producing countries.</p><p>Duveiller et al. [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that there are wheat-producing regions in the world, including central India, Bangladesh and Ethiopia, where the disease had not yet been reported, but the agro-climatic conditions are similar to regions in South America where the disease occurs. The 2016 occurrence of wheat blast in Bangladesh fits the original prediction. Maciel [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] expressed a similar concern, pointing out that wheat blast may spread to European countries, Canada, and the USA under the scenarios of global warming due to climate change. Cruz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] predicted that in the USA wheat blast could break out in 25% of the wheat area, with a probability exceeding 70% in the warmer and more humid states. Hence a serious threat of further wheat-blast expansion exists.</p><p>Wheat production in Bolivia is a notorious example of how wheat blast can destroy a nation&#x02019;s wheat crop. In the early 1990s, Bolivia started an initiative to increase its national wheat production, mainly to attain wheat food self-sufficiency [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The country managed to increase wheat production from 10,865 tons in 1989 to 75,435 tons in 1994, and 120,414 tons in 1997 [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Bangladesh has a sub-tropical monsoon climate across its primarily low-elevation landscape, with wide seasonal variations in rainfall, high temperatures and humidity. Wheat is grown during the relatively cool and dry winter. In March 2016, the emergence of wheat blast disease was first officially-recognized in Bangladesh, that reportedly affected eight districts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197555.g001">Fig 1</xref>): Chuadanga, Meherpur, Jessore, Jhenaidah, Bhola, Kushtia, Barisal and Pabna [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The 2016 event implied a particularly favorable scenario for wheat blast in terms of high humidity and temperature at the right time of the wheat growth stage (prior and during heading) with the initial presence of the blast inoculum. One may assume that now having the disease endemic in South Asia increases the prospects of it emerging again elsewhere in the region when the conditions are right. It also is likely that wheat blast will persist in the presence of alternative hosts (e.g. wild grass species, non-wheat crops), which undermine the prospects of eradicating the disease.</p><p>The present study uses a simple <italic>ex ante</italic> analysis to assess wheat-blast scenarios in South Asia. We consider two scenarios applied across the prospective wheat blast vulnerable areas: a 5% and a 10% wheat-blast-induced wheat-production shock in the vulnerable areas only; with in each case no effect (0% loss) in the non-vulnerable areas. One can interpret the 5% scenario as an average scenario; for instance, 10% of the vulnerable area could be affected by a 50% yield loss; alternatively, 5% of the vulnerable area could be affected by a devastating 100% yield loss, or variations thereof. Lacking further detailed insights for now, we assume the 5% and 10% production shocks to be reasonable scenarios within an <italic>ex ante</italic> impact assessment framework.</p><p>An additional but important caveat is that these are potential wheat-blast-induced production losses in the vulnerable areas during affected years. These scenarios depict specific situations where the season&#x02019;s agro-climatology favors an outbreak of blast in the vulnerable areas (i.e. the simultaneous combination of high humidity and temperature at the right time in the wheat season and in the presence of blast inoculum). Such conducive instances for wheat blast do not occur in all years, even in the vulnerable areas. The scenarios thereby represent occurrences that may happen in one particular year simultaneously across South Asia&#x02013;but not necessarily every year in the vulnerable areas. Even if it occurs, the disease may present itself as is the case in the 2016&#x02013;17 wheat season in Bangladesh, which was less propitious for wheat blast and hence was less badly affected than in the preceding 2015&#x02013;16 season. However, even though losses in the 2016&#x02013;17 cycle were less than in 2015&#x02013;16, the occurrence of the disease in Bangladesh indicates that wheat blast is now established, and occurs even though the weather was not conducive (relatively dry, limited rain).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>In Bangladesh, matching with the climate in the original four severely wheat-blast affected districts, the present study identifies 0.28 million ha (out of a total 0.43 million ha under wheat production) [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as vulnerable to wheat blast located in 46 districts (out of total 64 districts&#x02014;<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197555.t001">Table 1</xref>).

The threat of wheat blast increases the pressure on the already-precarious national food security in South Asia, and potentially adds pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices. Although wheat is one of the major and increasing sources of dietary calories in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Pakistan and Bangladesh are already regular importers of wheat over the last decade and, in 2016, even India resorted to imports. A potential wheat-blast-induced reduction of wheat production would have a significantly negative impact on the overall food security in the region and on international trade, potentially feeding into international wheat-price increases and threatening the food security of the poorest wheat consumers.</p><p>The yearly per capita consumption of wheat in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan in 2013 was 17.5 kg, 61 kg and 114 kg respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197555.t002">Table 2</xref>).

Under the potential wheat-blast-induced production losses of 5% and 10%, to maintain the consumption at the 2013 level, Bangladesh needs to import 1.5&#x02013;3.0% more wheat. Pakistan, a net importer of wheat based on the net average wheat trade statistics, imported 0.22 million tons of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] from 2009 to 2013.

Worryingly, the largest wheat-producing Sub-Saharan African country, Ethiopia, is also vulnerable to the wheat-blast threat due its climatic conditions. In due time, the wheat-blast impacts are likely to reach beyond the already-significant impacts in South Asia.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusion and policy implications</title><p>In 2016, the devastating wheat-blast disease was found in Bangladesh &#x02012; its first occurrence outside South America. The disease is now endemic in the densely-populated region, presenting potentially devastating negative impacts on wheat production, income and livelihoods of wheat farmers, and the overall food security in Bangladesh.</p><p>This study first identified the area vulnerable to wheat blast in South Asia by matching the historical weather variables across Bangladesh, India and Pakistan to those in the 2016 epicenter. The study identified a total of seven million ha of wheat in these countries that are vulnerable to the wheat-blast disease. The study then used two scenarios applied across the vulnerable areas: a 5% and 10% wheat-blast-induced wheat production shock. Across South Asia, the wheat-blast-induced wheat-yield loss scenarios of 5&#x02013;10% imply a potential wheat loss in affected years of 0.89&#x02013;1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132&#x02013;264 million. Such losses further threaten the already-precarious national food security, adding pressure to wheat imports and wheat prices. The increase in wheat prices can escalate the number of people facing hunger by lowering their purchasing power, which can ultimately impair the food security of the entire region.</p><p>The study is a call for action to tackle the now real wheat-blast threat in South Asia and calls for both short-term and long-term action plans to mitigate the threat. In the short term, investments are needed in research and development to better understand the disease and its implications in the South Asia setting, and to monitor its re-occurrence and resort to immediate control measures to check the spread and damage. Since this is a new disease, awareness creation among wheat growers and all stakeholders is equally important in the short term. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies to manage the disease, such as developing and deploying appropriate fungicides to ensure effective chemicals are available in the hands of the farmers at an affordable price and at the right time, especially during wheat-blast-conducive environments, along with the knowledge of the appropriate use of these fungicides. However, only fungicide application, which is a short-term solution, is not enough as the rapid development of fungicide resistance was observed in Brazil. To prepare for the long term, a concerted effort and long-term assured investments are needed immediately to develop and disseminate blast-resistant wheat varieties, including their targeting to vulnerable areas, and reliable and timely surveillance and disease forecasting to ensure wheat food security for the masses.</p><p>The present study has a few limitations. First, data and the associated assumptions intrinsically limit this study. More detailed data sets and enhanced understanding of the disease in the South Asia context could provide the foundation for more rigorous and advanced models in the future (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). This study assumes the potential disease spread in areas based on a similarity of 60% or higher in terms of rainfall and temperature to the 2016 epicenter in Bangladesh. In reality, wheat blast can spread in more restricted or more extended areas than the present homologue areas considered, depending on the local micro-climate conditions which can be more or less favorable to the development of the disease. Using daily climate data for the growing season of the 2016 outbreak sites in Bangladesh would allow the potential high-risk wheat-blast areas to be narrowed down with more precision and allow the establishment of early warning systems to give research institutions, farmers and extension services in the region the ability to react quickly with plant protection measures in wheat fields or spot eradication if needed. Currently, regional coverage of daily data is limited for near real-time warning systems, but investment in the expansion of weather station networks with automated online availability such as is currently being undertaken by the Government of Bangladesh is crucial. Long-term climate conditions were assumed for the analysis, even given the anomaly of the rainfall events leading to the outbreak. However, the reappearance of the pathogen in 2017 shows that, once established, the disease can cause damage even under relatively normal weather conditions similar to the large outbreak in 2009 in South America.</p><p>Second, this study assumed some factors to remain constant. For instance, that there will be no gain in virulence in the pathogen, i.e. the disease epidemic in 2016 remains the base. It did not consider any change in acreage of wheat production or its economics due to the presence of the disease and additional costs related to fungicide application and potential price effects. Finally, the origin and pathway of wheat blast into Bangladesh and the pathogen nomenclature are beyond the scope of the present study, although a few studies have linked the Bangladesh introduction with South America [<xref rid="pone.0197555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], probably associated with wheat imports from Brazil. A rigorous establishment of the source and pathways of the wheat-blast disease into Bangladesh and beyond is needed not least to identify the role of quarantine failure and leakages and associated policy learnings and implications to avoid such costly re-occurrences of disease introductions in an ever more connected world.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the CGIAR research program on WHEAT agro-food systems and the Australian Center for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR).
