Here, we demonstrate a method for accelerating soybean breeding in compact growth chambers, which greatly shortens the generation time of the plants and accelerates breeding and research projects. Our breeding method utilizes commonly used fluorescent lamps (220 &#x0fffd;mol m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the canopy level), a 14 h light (30&#x0fffd;C)/10 h dark (25&#x0fffd;C) cycle and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) supplementation at &#x0003e;400 p.p.m. Using this approach, the generation time of the best-characterized elite Japanese soybean cultivar, Enrei, was shortened from 102&#x02013;132 d reported in the field to just 70 d, thereby allowing up to 5 generations per year instead of the 1&#x02013;2 generations currently possible in the field and/or greenhouse. The method also facilitates the highly efficient and controlled crossing of soybean plants. Our method uses CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation to promote the growth and yield of plants, appropriate light and temperature conditions to reduce the days to flowering, and the reaping and sowing of immature seeds to shorten the reproductive period greatly. Thus, the appropriate parameters enable acceleration of soybean breeding in the compact growth chambers commonly used for laboratory research. The parameters used in our method could therefore be optimized for other species, cultivars, accessions and experimental designs to facilitate rapid breeding in a wide range of crops.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Accelerated generation</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation</kwd><kwd>Crossing</kwd><kwd><italic>Glycine max</italic></kwd><kwd>Growth chamber</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001691</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">KAKENHI</named-content></funding-source><award-id>24510312</award-id><award-id>16K07412</award-id><award-id>18K05379</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003993</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">MAFF</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100003993</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.

The global production of soybean was the fourth highest of all crops in 2016, after maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) (FAOSTAT database). Over the past two decades, worldwide soybean production and the area harvested have increased more rapidly than those of the other staple crops (FAOSTAT database), with soybean being increasingly used as a food oil, especially in emerging economies [<xref rid="pcy189-B42" ref-type="bibr">United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2018</xref>]. Although the current major producers of soybean are the USA, Brazil and Argentina, soybean is an ancient food crop in China, Korea and Japan (<xref rid="pcy189-B30" ref-type="bibr">Ohyama et&#x0fffd;al. 2013</xref>), cultivated for thousands of years, and numerous wild and cultivated soybean accessions originated in East Asia (<xref rid="pcy189-B48" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x0fffd;al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kaga et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>). Soybean seeds are not only a major source of nutritious food for humans and livestock, but are also used for industrial materials, due to their high protein and oil contents (<xref rid="pcy189-B50" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et&#x0fffd;al. 2012a</xref>).</p><p>The multifaceted importance of soybean has led to the development of a wide range of tools and genomic resources, which are easily accessible from public databases such as SoyBase (<xref rid="pcy189-B11" ref-type="bibr">Grant et&#x0fffd;al. 2010</xref>), SoyKB (<xref rid="pcy189-B16" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>) and Phytozome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#">https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#</ext-link>) (<xref rid="pcy189-B35" ref-type="bibr">Schmutz et&#x0fffd;al. 2010</xref>).

Artificial and natural mutant resources have been developed, including ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant libraries (<xref rid="pcy189-B7" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et&#x0fffd;al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B14" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino et&#x0fffd;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B41" ref-type="bibr">Tsuda et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B21" ref-type="bibr">Lakhssassi et&#x0fffd;al. 2017</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B9" ref-type="bibr">Espina et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>) and the collation of selected sets of germplasm into core collections of soybean accessions (<xref rid="pcy189-B17" ref-type="bibr">Kaga et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>). These tools and resources have established soybean as a model legume crop. However, many plant researchers believe that soybean needs more light than model plants, and that crossing genotypes is more laborious (<xref rid="pcy189-B38" ref-type="bibr">Talukdar and Shivakumar 2012</xref>). Moreover, the slow generation times of soybean remain a major barrier to soybean studies.</p><p>Recently, <xref rid="pcy189-B46" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x0fffd;al.

Here, we describe a new method for accelerating soybean breeding in widely used compact growth chambers, which greatly reduces its generation time and facilitates soybean breeding and research programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation enhances the growth and yield of soybean plants in growth chambers</title><p>Here, we aimed to develop a method for accelerating soybean breeding using compact, environmentally controlled growth chambers (internal volumes of approximately 0.4 m<sup>3</sup>), which are widely used in laboratory-based plant research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F1">Fig.&#x0fffd;1A</xref>). The chambers were fitted with commonly used fluorescent lamps, which provided a light intensity of around 220 &#x0fffd;mol m<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the canopy level. As the appropriate cultivation area of each soybean cultivar is limited to relatively narrow latitudes (<xref rid="pcy189-B44" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>), a single cultivar, the well-characterized elite Japanese soybean cultivar Enrei, was mainly used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The genome sequence of Enrei has been published (<xref rid="pcy189-B37" ref-type="bibr">Shimomura et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>), and its genomic information is available in a public database, DaizuBase (<xref rid="pcy189-B18" ref-type="bibr">Katayose et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>). Moreover, a high-density mutant library, a high-density linkage map and chromosomal segment substitution lines have been developed for Enrei (<xref rid="pcy189-B41" ref-type="bibr">Tsuda et&#x0fffd;al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B45" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>).

These conditions are comparable with those of mid-summer in the plain regions of Japan (Japan Meteorological Agency, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/data/en/smp/index.html">https://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/data/en/smp/index.html</ext-link>). Previous studies have shown that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations inside growth chambers, which comprise a closed and limited space, were much lower than those of the ambient atmosphere (at approximately 400 p.p.m.) during the active growth phase of rice, and that CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation improved the growth and yields of rice grown in plant growth chambers (<xref rid="pcy189-B29" ref-type="bibr">Ohnishi et&#x0fffd;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et&#x0fffd;al. 2016</xref>). To examine how exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation affects the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside growth chambers in the presence of soybean plants, the internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were recorded. During the light period, the internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration ranged from 400 to 600 p.p.m. in the growth chambers supplemented with CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the unsupplemented growth chamber was consistently around 200 p.p.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F1">Fig.&#x0fffd;1B</xref>) at 25 d after flowering. During the dark period, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration markedly increased to around 1,200 and 750 p.p.m. in the growth chambers with and without supplemental CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F1">Fig.&#x0fffd;1B</xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the growth chamber were changing depending on the soybean growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). These data suggest that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside growth chambers is strongly affected by the photosynthesis and respiration of the soybean plants. In accordance with previous observations in rice (<xref rid="pcy189-B29" ref-type="bibr">Ohnishi et&#x0fffd;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et&#x0fffd;al. 2016</xref>), our findings show that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations within growth chambers are lower than the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration during the day, which may retard plant growth.</p><p>We therefore investigated the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation on soybean growth in the growth chamber. Consistent with previous reports in rice (<xref rid="pcy189-B29" ref-type="bibr">Ohnishi et&#x0fffd;al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B39" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et&#x0fffd;al. 2016</xref>), we found that CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation enhanced the growth and development of soybean in the growth chamber in terms of total leaf area, plant height, total length of branches, dry leaf weight, dry stem weight and dry root weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F2">Fig.&#x0fffd;2;</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). We also evaluated the seed yields of the soybean plants, and found that the average seed numbers per plant were 53.4 &#x0fffd; 9.1 when supplemented with CO<sub>2</sub> and 26.6 &#x0fffd; 2.5 in the unsupplemented chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S4A</xref>&#x02013;F). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the number of seeds per pod produced by plants grown in chambers with or without supplemental CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S4G</xref>). We further evaluated the quality of the harvested seeds and found that the average seed weight was significantly increased by CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S4E</xref>, H). These results therefore indicate that CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation enhances the growth and yield of soybean plants in the growth chamber.

Many healthy flowers (25.3 &#x0fffd; 5.9 in the first 5 d of flowering) were observed in the vigorous soybean plants grown in these smaller pots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). These observations suggest that the soybean plants grown in smaller pots produced almost as many healthy flowers as those plants grown in the larger pots, indicating that at least 30 plants could be grown for accelerating breeding in each growth chamber. These results show that CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation increases the amount of high-quality flowers produced by soybean plants in growth chambers, indicating that the flowers of soybean grown in the CO<sub>2</sub>-supplemented growth chamber might be useful for performing effective crossings. Until now, conducting effective crossings out of season in artificial conditions was considered to be more challenging than doing so in the field in summer.</p><p>Therefore, to test the quality of the flowers produced by soybean plants grown in the CO<sub>2</sub>-supplemented growth chambers, we investigated their crossing efficiency.

We harvested fully swollen immature pods at 37 d after flowering, as they started to change color from green to yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F5">Fig.&#x0fffd;5A</xref>). After air-drying the pods for 8 d, their color changed to light brown, and the seeds in the pods matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F5">Fig.&#x0fffd;5B</xref>). Their germination rate at 7 d after sowing was 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F5">Fig.&#x0fffd;5C</xref>).

We have usually used the progeny grown from immature seeds as well as mature seeds for crossing. These data showed that the germination ratio and subsequent growth rate of these immature seeds were comparable with those of mature seeds, indicating that the harvesting and germination of immature seeds could be used to shorten further the generation time of soybean plants grown in CO<sub>2</sub>-supplemented growth chambers.

The recently reported speed breeding methods (<xref rid="pcy189-B46" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>) have not been applied to short-day soybean plants; however, our method can reduce the generation time of the soybean cultivar Enrei, the best-characterized Japanese cultivar, to just 70 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F6">Fig.&#x0fffd;6</xref>). This breeding approach therefore allows up to 5 generations per year, instead of the 1&#x02013;2 generations currently possible under field and greenhouse conditions. Moreover, our method allows the highly efficient controlled crossing of soybean lines under laboratory conditions, enabling researchers and breeders to work consistently year-round, whatever the weather or season.

See main text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcy189f6"/></fig><p>Our breeding method uses supplemental CO<sub>2</sub> in combination with appropriate light and temperature cycles to accelerate the growth and development of plants, and the reaping and sowing of immature seeds to greatly shorten the generation time further in the growth chamber. The compact chambers (0.4 m<sup>3</sup>) used in this study are widely used for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> research, thereby enabling plant researchers to shift their focus from this weedy model plant to soybean, a staple crop. Since the light intensity derived from general purpose fluorescent lamps was just 220 &#x0fffd;mol m<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>1</sup> at the canopy level in the growth chamber used in this study, the lighting costs (for both the light source and the electricity) would be lower than those described in recent speed breeding protocols, which use high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) providing light intensities of 340&#x02013;650 &#x0fffd;mol m<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup>1</sup> (<xref rid="pcy189-B46" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>). Furthermore, our method uses a 14 h light period, which is much shorter than the 22 h period required by other speed breeding methods (<xref rid="pcy189-B46" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>), contributing further cost savings.</p><p>So far, it has been difficult to obtain enough high-quality soybean flowers to perform effective crossings in artificial conditions, due to the less vigorous growth of plants compared with those in the field. We demonstrated that CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation enhances the quantity and quality of both vegetative and reproductive growth in soybean plants in the growth chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcy189-F2">Figs.&#x0fffd;2, 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figs. S3, S4</xref>), and allows for the highly efficient controlled crossing of soybean. However, CO<sub>2</sub> supplementation is not directly involved in shortening the soybean life cycle. Instead, appropriate light and temperature cycles can be used to decrease the number of days to soybean flower initiation from 33&#x02013;59 d (<xref rid="pcy189-B49" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et&#x0fffd;al. 2012b</xref>) to 25 d, while the reaping and sowing of immature seeds greatly shortens the reproductive period from 65&#x02013;92 d (<xref rid="pcy189-B49" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et&#x0fffd;al. 2012b</xref>) to 45 d. Thus, the appropriate combination of supplemental CO<sub>2</sub>, light and temperature conditions with the use of immature seeds would allow reduction of the generation time of Enrei from 102&#x02013;132 d in the field (<xref rid="pcy189-B49" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et&#x0fffd;al. 2012b</xref>) to just 70 d.</p><p>Considering the previous findings that Enrei is a weakly photosensitive cultivar (<xref rid="pcy189-B32" ref-type="bibr">Ozawa et&#x0fffd;al. 2017</xref>) and that comparatively higher temperatures accelerate the flowering times in soybean plants (<xref rid="pcy189-B12" ref-type="bibr">Hadley et&#x0fffd;al. 1984</xref>), our data suggest that the temperature setting used in this study plays a more important role in the reduction in the days to flowering of Enrei. On the other hand, soybean plants are generally photosensitive, and thus there are variations in the days to flowering in soybean cultivars. However, although the cultivars used in this study, Enrei, Williams82 and BR16, greatly vary in cultivation areas (<xref rid="pcy189-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alliprandini et al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B50" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al. 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B47" ref-type="bibr">Wolfgang and An 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), we showed that in these distinct cultivars, the days to flowering can be reduced with our method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). Their growth habits are also different; Enrei and BR16 are determinate cultivars, whereas Williams 82 is an indeterminate cultivar (<xref rid="pcy189-B31" ref-type="bibr">Oya et&#x0fffd;al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B40" ref-type="bibr">Tian et&#x0fffd;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B49" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et&#x0fffd;al. 2012b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). As the latitude of cultivation areas and growth habits mainly depend on specific genotypes (<xref rid="pcy189-B2" ref-type="bibr">Bernard 1972</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B40" ref-type="bibr">Tian et&#x0fffd;al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B25" ref-type="bibr">Maldonado dos Santos et&#x0fffd;al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B22" ref-type="bibr">Langewisch et&#x0fffd;al. 2017</xref>), these findings suggest the possibility that our technique is of general application in a wide range of soybean cultivars. Given that each soybean cultivar can be cultivated only in limited latitudes (<xref rid="pcy189-B44" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et&#x0fffd;al. 2012</xref>), the photoperiod conditions among the parameters in our method needs to be adapted for each cultivar. Alongside other protocols for speed breeding and effective phenotyping (<xref rid="pcy189-B20" ref-type="bibr">Kuroda and Ikenaga 2015</xref>, <xref rid="pcy189-B46" ref-type="bibr">Watson et&#x0fffd;al. 2018</xref>), the parameters used in our method could be optimized for a variety of species, cultivars, accessions and experimental designs to facilitate cutting-edge breeding in a wide range of crops.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.

The calyx and corolla were detached, after which the immature anthers were carefully removed (emasculation). The pollen-containing anthers of male parents from newly opened flowers, which have a single nucleotide substitution in the Enrei genome background, were then gently attached to the stigma of the female emasculated flowers.

To determine the number of hybrid seeds, a C-to-T mutation site derived from male parents was used as a marker. Total DNAs were extracted from 52 seeds harvested from the soybean plants 30 d after crossing, using a simple and rapid DNA extraction method (<xref rid="pcy189-B8" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et&#x0fffd;al. 1991</xref>).
