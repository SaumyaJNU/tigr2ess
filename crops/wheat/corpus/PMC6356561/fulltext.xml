This narrative review presents the state of the science on the role of hydration in health in the general population, specifically in skin health, neurological function (i.e., cognition, mood, and headache), gastrointestinal and renal functions, and body weight and composition. There is a growing body of evidence that supports the importance of adequate hydration in maintaining proper health, especially with regard to cognition, kidney stone risk, and weight management. However, the evidence is largely associative and lacks consistency, and the number of randomized trials is limited. Additionally, there are major gaps in knowledge related to health outcomes due to small variations in hydration status, the influence of sex and sex hormones, and age, especially in older adults and children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fluid</kwd><kwd>water</kwd><kwd>dehydration</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>constipation</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>mood</kwd><kwd>headache</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-11-00070"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Water is essential for life and is involved in virtually all functions of the human body [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is important in thermoregulation, as a solvent for biochemical reactions, for maintenance of vascular volume, and as the transport medium for providing nutrients within and removal of waste from the body [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Deficits in body water can compromise our health if they lead to substantial perturbations in body water balance [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As with other essential substances, intake recommendations for water are available from various authoritative bodies [e.g., Institute of Medicine (IOM) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)], and generally range from 2&#x02013;2.7 L/day for adult females and 2.5&#x02013;3.7 L/day for adult males [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Body water balance depends on the net difference between water gain and water loss. The process of maintaining water balance is described as &#x0201c;hydration&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Euhydration&#x0201d; defines a normal and narrow fluctuation in body water content, while &#x0201c;hypohydration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;hyperhydration&#x0201d; refer to a generalized body water deficit or excess, respectively, beyond the normal range. Finally, &#x0201c;dehydration&#x0201d; describes the process of losing body water while &#x0201c;rehydration&#x0201d; describes the process of gaining body water. Dehydration can be further classified based on the route of water loss and the amount of osmolytes (electrolytes) lost in association with the water. Iso-osmotic hypovolemia is the loss of water and osmolytes in equal proportions, which is typically caused by fluid losses induced by cold, altitude, diuretics, and secretory diarrhea. Hyperosmotic hypovolemia occurs when the loss of water is greater than that of osmolytes, and primarily results from insufficient fluid intake to offset normal daily fluid losses (e.g., loss of pure water by respiration and transcutaneous evaporation). Hyperosmotic hypovolemia is exacerbated with high sweat loss (warm weather or exercise) or osmotic diarrhea [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The normal daily variation of body water is &#x0003c;2% body mass loss (~3% of total body water); thus, hypohydration is clinically defined as &#x02265;2% body mass deficit [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The kidneys can regulate plasma osmolality within a narrow limit (&#x000b1;2% or 280 to 290 mOsm/kg) and plasma osmolality between 295 and 300 mOsm/kg is considered mild or impending hyperosmotic hypovolemia, while values greater than 300 mOsm/kg are considered frank hyperosmotic hypovolemia [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For urine osmolality, values above 1000 mOsm/L are considered elevated and may be a sign of hyperosmotic hypovolemia [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Finally, it has generally been accepted that a first-morning void urine specific gravity (USG) of less than or equal to 1.020 represents euhydration [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Hydration status is assessed in a variety of ways in human studies, the most common of which are body weight changes, plasma and/or urine osmolality, and USG. The choice of hydration assessment method and its interpretation is dependent on the type of dehydration; for example, iso-osmotic hypovolemia does not increase plasma or serum osmolality and USG due to the concurrent loss of salt and water. Further complicating the assessment of hydration status are confounding factors such as age and differences in renal function, and these limitations among others have been covered in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition to assessing hydration status, studies investigating the effects of hydration on health often include measurements of fluid intake, which is usually conducted with dietary assessment methods such as dietary record, diet recall, or food frequency questionnaires. A full assessment of the advantages and limitations of these methods (e.g., difficulties with method validation, challenges in usage among children and the elderly with cognitive issues) are outside the scope of the current review, but have been discussed in detail by others [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Several reviews on the role of hydration in disease development and progression, as well as the role of hydration in exercise and physical performance have been published [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, few reviews are available on the role of hydration in general health, with the exception of a few outcome areas (e.g., weight loss, cognition). An assessment of the role of hydration in general health that thoroughly evaluates the evidence related to the commonly believed benefits of hydration is not available. Thus, the objective of this review was to provide an assessment of the current state of science on hydration and health relevant to the general population. This review includes skin health, neurological, gastrointestinal and renal functions, and body weight and composition in relation to hydration in generally healthy individuals. Publications reviewed include the most current systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as primary intervention studies published since these reviews.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-11-00070"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The PubMed database was initially searched for reviews on hydration that were published in English. All searches and screening were performed independently by two authors. Reviews were identified using the search terms &#x0201c;hydration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dehydration&#x0201d; and selection included those that were conducted using a systematic search process and related to a health area applicable to the general population. In the absence of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, comprehensive narrative reviews that included details on the studies reviewed were included, while opinion pieces were excluded. In addition, hand-searching of references in selected reviews were performed. Key systematic and comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses are summarized in <xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. </p><p>In order to represent the current state of the literature, primary studies that were not included in the reviews were also identified. Individual searches for clinical intervention trials in generally healthy populations (ages &#x0003e;2 years) and excluding those conducted in diseases populations were conducted in PubMed using the All Fields (ALL) function for terms for hydration and the specific health outcome area. When a systematic review had been identified, the updated search for primary literature overlapped the search in the published systematic review by a year. When a systematic review of a specific topic was not found, the search for primary literature was performed in PubMed starting from its inception. Search terms were compared with the systematic reviews on each topic, when available.</p><p>A flowchart documenting the updated search strategy and results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00070-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The updated search for weight management used the terms &#x0201c;(fluid OR water OR hydration OR dehydration) AND (weight OR BMI (body mass index) OR circumference)&#x0201d;. For hydration and skin, the terms included &#x0201c;(fluid OR water OR hydration OR dehydration) AND (skin OR epidermal OR transepidermal) NOT (topical OR injection OR injector)&#x0201d;. Search terms for studies on hydration and neurological function were &#x0201c;(water OR hydration OR dehydration) AND (mental OR mood OR cognition OR fatigue OR sleep OR headache)&#x0201d; and studies in diseased population such as dementia were excluded. For gastrointestinal function, the search terms included &#x0201c;(fluid OR water OR hydration OR dehydration) AND (intestinal OR gastric OR constipation) NOT (infant OR cancer)&#x0201d;. Finally, for hydration and renal function, &#x0201c;(fluid OR water OR hydration OR dehydration) AND (kidney OR renal) NOT (infant OR cancer)&#x0201d; was used and studies involving diseased populations such as chronic kidney disease were excluded. Only clinical trials that were not included in systematic reviews are reported in detail in each health outcome section. Information from each primary study was extracted using a pre-determined PICOS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, study design) table, making sure that any reports of hydration status (e.g., body weight change, plasma osmolality) or fluid intake were recorded.</p><p>Finally, the reporting and methodological qualities of each systematic review and meta-analysis was assessed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (<uri xlink:href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/">http://www.prisma-statement.org/</uri>) and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 (<uri xlink:href="https://amstar.ca/index.php">https://amstar.ca/index.php</uri>). For meta-analyses, the PRISMA checklist contained 24 required reporting items and three optional items [item 16 (description of additional analyses, if performed), item 19 (reporting of data on risk of bias for each study, if performed), and item 23 (reporting of results of additional analysis, if performed)]. Only the required items were used for scoring. For systematic reviews, 19 items remained after exclusion of optional items and items specific to meta-analyses (i.e., items 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22, which are related to data analysis and risk bias assessment). AMSTAR 2 has 16 items in total, whereby three of these are specific for meta-analysis. </p></sec><sec id="sec3-nutrients-11-00070"><title>3. Hydration and Health Outcomes</title><sec id="sec3dot1-nutrients-11-00070"><title>3.1. Skin Health</title><p>The skin&#x02019;s primary functions are to protect the body from external challenges (e.g., chemicals, microbiological materials, and physical stressors), regulate water loss and body temperature, and sense the external environment [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The skin also serves as a reservoir for nutrients and water and contributes to important metabolic activities [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The external layer of the skin provides an epidermal barrier, which is composed of 15&#x02013;20 layers of cornified keratinocytes (corneocytes). The stratum corneum (SC) layer of the epidermis is the primary location of the barrier function; however, both the dermis and the multilayered epidermis are important for maintenance of barrier integrity [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Measurements for skin barrier function and hydration include transepidermal water loss (TEWL), SC hydration, &#x0201c;deep&#x0201d; skin hydration, clinical evaluation of dryness, roughness and elasticity, skin relief parameter, the average roughness, evaluation of skin surface morphology, skin smoothness and roughness, extensibility, sebum content, and skin surface pH [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>For hydration and skin health, a 2018 systematic review was identified [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which included five intervention studies. Of these studies, four measured surface hydration and reported increased SC hydration following additional intake of 2 L daily of water over a period of 30 days [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or additional intake of 1 L per day for a period of 42 days [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Of note, only one of these studies [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] compared the effect of additional water consumption in those who habitually consumed below or above the EFSA water requirement (2 L/day). Other studies either assessed participants who were habitually meeting or exceeding the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) requirements [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or failed to report baseline fluid intake [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In studies that stratified based on baseline water intake [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], positive impact on skin hydration was evident in participants whose baseline total water intake was less than 3.2 L per day. Measurements of dryness and roughness were reported in one study [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and these decreased with additional water intake. Measurements of skin elasticity [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], extensibility [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the ability of the skin to return to its original state [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were greater with additional water intake. However, the review authors concluded that the evidence is weak in terms of quantity and methodological quality, and risk of bias in the interventional studies is extremely high [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. With the exception of providing an explicit statement of questions being addressed and clarifying if a review protocol existed, the 2018 systematic review fulfilled all required PRISMA reporting items (<xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The systematic review fulfilled only four out of the 13 required AMSTAR 2 items and lacked clarity on inclusion criteria and study selection, robustness of study selection, and completeness in description and assessment of included studies.</p><p>Our updated search resulted in 178 titles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00070-f001">Figure 1</xref>), but the vast majority assessed topical applications (e.g., moisturizers), oral ingestion of supplements or herbals, or skin conditions in disease states. No new intervention studies were found when compared with the 2018 systematic review [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-11-00070"><title>3.2. Neurological Function</title><p>Studies on hydration and neurological function focused on cognition, mood, fatigue, sleep, and headache. In general, the areas of cognition, mood, and fatigue overlap in studies, with some also including sleep and headache outcomes. No single systematic review covered these various topics; however, comprehensive narrative reviews that included discussions on cognition [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and headache [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were identified. Thus, our search for primary literature on this topic was not limited to recent literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00070-f001">Figure 1</xref>). After screening, 29 studies were selected and these are summarized in <xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Of the cognition studies, eight investigated children and adolescents, 18 adults, and one both children and adults, while two other studies looked at headaches in adults. None of the intervention studies were specific to fatigue or sleep.</p><sec id="sec3dot2dot1-nutrients-11-00070"><title>3.2.1. Cognition, Mood, and Fatigue in Adults</title><p>Cognition is a complex function that is composed of several subdomains including different types of memory, attentiveness, reaction time, and executive function. Studies often differ in the specific subdomains assessed as well as the tool used for these measurements. Assessments of mood are also varied across studies, with a number of different types of questionnaires; although a consensus approach does not exist, some validated questionnaires are available [e.g., Bond-Lader, Profile of Moods States (POMS)] and these are the most commonly used. </p><p>Several recent reviews of the data in adults have been published (<xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Benton and Young [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] concluded that reductions in body mass by &#x0003e;2% due to dehydration are consistently associated with greater fatigue and lower alertness; however, the effects on cognition is less consistent. Masento et al. [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] summarized that severe hypohydration was shown to have detrimental effects on short-term memory and visual perceptual abilities, whereas water consumption can improve cognitive performance, particularly visual attention and mood. These authors also note some of the challenges with studying hydration effects on mood and cognition include variations among subjects (e.g., differing levels of thirst at baseline, habitual intake, and individual adaptation), mediating factors (e.g., water temperature, time of cognition testing, testing environment), variation in types of cognition tests, and distinguishing effects due to thirst and hydration status.</p><p>As noted by previous review authors, the studies we identified on attention are heterogeneous in methodology and outcomes. Studies included acute and chronic water consumption, with or without initial dehydration, and measured various types of attention including visual, sustained, and focused (<xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Following an overnight fast, acute intake of 25, 200, or 300 mL water improved visual attention [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Acute intake of water (120 or 330 mL) immediately before testing improved sustained attention in one study [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], but not in another that required overnight fasting prior to consumption of 300 mL water [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Both studies assessed sustained attention using the Rapid Visual Information Processing task although the former allowed habitual fluid intake prior to cognition assessments (performed at 11 am or 3 pm), and the latter restricted fluid and food intake for 9 h prior to testing. When dehydration was induced by exercise with or without diuretic (body mass loss of &#x02265;1%), sustained attention decreased compared to exercise with fluid replacement in men [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, a similar dehydration and euhydration protocol did not affect sustained attention in women [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Dehydration induced by water deprivation (average body mass loss of 1%) also did not affect visual attention [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

Smaller degree of dehydration by fluid restriction (mean body mass loss of 1.08%) also did not affect motor speed and visual motor function, visual learning, and cognitive flexibility, but decreased executive function and spatial problem solving [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

It is possible that mood effects of acute water consumption in these studies were not observed due to the timing of testing relative to water consumption (often &#x0003e;20 min).

Increasing water intake of low-consumers (&#x0003c;1.2 L/day) decreased confusion/bewilderment scores and fatigue/inertia scores while decreasing water intake of high-consumers (&#x0003e;2 L/day) decreased contentedness, calmness, positive emotions, and vigor/activity scores without affecting sleepiness [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Finally, fluid deprivation for 24 h did not affect sleepiness [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. </p><p>In general, our assessment is consistent with the conclusions from the aforementioned reviews, whereby hypohydration and/or thirst is consistently associated with increased negative emotions. The effect of hypohydration on attention and memory seem to suggest that &#x0003e;1% body mass loss is associated with deterioration in attention and memory, although this may be subdomain- and/or sex-dependent. Fatigue/tiredness appears to be rated higher with dehydration and is unlikely to be affected by acute water consumption.

Finally, increasing water consumption (mean increase of ~310 mL/day) did not affect BMI and other anthropometric measures in overweight and obese adolescents (<italic>n</italic> = 38) who were enrolled in a weight-loss program for 6 months [<xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The results of these new studies were mostly consistent with the general observations presented by the 2016 systematic review. The long-term study that reported weight loss instructed obese subjects to follow an energy-restricted diet and consume &#x0003e;1 L water/day, although the change in glucose and insulin is unknown [<xref rid="B85-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In contrast, the authors of the long-term study that did not observe changes in body weight commented that subjects failed to increase water consumption, such that there were no differences in urine specific gravity between the water and control groups [<xref rid="B86-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-nutrients-11-00070"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Water is involved in virtually all bodily function. Thus, ensuring that the body has enough water to maintain proper function is important for health. According to the analysis of combined urine osmolality data from the NHANES 2009&#x02013;2010 and 2011&#x02013;2012 surveys, about 1/3 (32.6%) of adults (ages 18&#x02013;64 years old) [<xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and more than half (54.5%) of children and adolescents (ages 6&#x02013;19 years old) [<xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] in the US are inadequately hydrated. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of hydration on health in the general population. This review is a compilation of evidence on hydration and various health outcomes thought to have a beneficial effect among the general population, including skin health, gastrointestinal and renal function, cognition, mood, headache, and body weight and composition, with cognition being the most researched. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of maintaining a normal state of hydration on various health aspects, although the strength and quality of the evidence vary within each health area (<xref rid="nutrients-11-00070-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). </p><p>Evidence on hydration status and skin health is limited and no new studies published after a 2018 systematic review of the topic [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were identified. Results from the handful of studies included in the review suggest that increasing water consumption may improve SC hydration. One of the most important functions of the skin is its ability to serve as an efficient barrier to molecular diffusion and the SC layer of the epidermis is the primary location of this barrier function. SC hydration is intimately related to the structure and function of the SC [<xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], thus, it is often an outcome in studies on skin health. The improvements in SC hydration following increased water consumption reported by existing intervention studies suggest better skin barrier function with increased oral hydration; however, these studies reported no changes in TEWL, which is another measure of skin barrier integrity. Therefore, the effectiveness of additional water consumption on skin barrier function is unclear. Furthermore, these studies failed to consistently assess other skin parameters such as those related to elasticity, firmness, roughness, surface texture, and pigmentation. Also, the applicability of the results of these studies is unclear; in most cases, subjects were already meeting the water intake recommendations and/or were required to consume water above the recommended intakes. Available studies were assessed to have low methodological quality and extremely high risk of bias by the authors of the systematic review [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>Studies on hydration and neurological function focused on cognition, mood, and headache, with some also assessing sleep and fatigue. Studies on cognition investigated a variety of subdomains using different assessment tools, which makes comparisons across studies challenging. Evidence within each subdomain is sparse; thus, the specific influence of hydration on cognition is unclear. Reviewing the evidence in adults and children together, however, suggests that hypohydration negatively influences attention and results in the need for greater effort when performing attention-oriented tasks, which is ameliorated by rehydration. The effects of hypohydration and rehydration are less pronounced for memory and reaction time. Our observations are consistent with results from a recent meta-analysis published after our search date of April 2018 [<xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The meta-analysis authors reported that high-order cognitive processing (involving attention and executive function) and motor coordination appear more susceptible to impairment following dehydration compared to other domains involving lower order mental processing (e.g., simple reaction time) [<xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Additionally, across all cognitive domains and outcomes, studies eliciting a &#x0003e;2% body mass loss resulted in significantly greater cognitive impairments than studies eliciting &#x02264; 2% body mass loss [<xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The relationship between hydration and mood appears to be more consistent in adults, with hypohydration associated with increased negative emotions such as anger, hostility, confusion, depression, and tension as well as fatigue and tiredness. In children, however, data on hydration and mood is very limited and unclear. Overall, hydration does affect cognition and mood, although the specifics of the relationships are unclear. Finally, the evidence is too limited to determine if hydration affects headache. Two studies reported that increases in water consumption did not improve objective measures of headache, including number of days with headaches, hours of headache, and medication use, although subjective measures, such as headache intensity rating and quality of life questionnaire scores, were improved.</p><p>The renal system plays an important role in maintaining water and salt homeostasis; thus hydration is often associated with renal function and health, particularly the risk of kidney stones. The pathophysiology of kidney stone development is not yet fully understood, although a likely cause is an acquired or congenital anatomical structural abnormality [<xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Kidney stones form when the concentration of stone-forming salts exceeds their saturation point in the urine [<xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Thus, it is commonly suggested that dehydration may lead to the development of kidney stones, and that consumption of fluid may decrease the risk of kidney stones. Findings consistently suggest that increased fluid intake resulting in increased urine output is related to reduced risk of kidney stone development or recurrence rate, although data are limited. For example, a recent meta-analysis that included two intervention and seven observational studies reported a significant association between high fluid intake and a lower risk of incident kidney stones [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The observational studies were of moderately high quality, however, the two intervention studies were of low quality [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further, limitations in the current literature include differences in diagnostic methodology of kidney stones, as well as inconsistent definitions of stone occurrence and recurrence. Overall, kidney stone occurrence is likely dependent on hydration and additional intervention studies are needed to confirm this relationship.</p><p>Another important kidney function is the removal of a wide variety of potentially toxic xenobiotics, xenobiotic metabolites, as well as metabolic wastes from the body. Elimination of unwanted substances via the urine depends on several variables that are, in turn, highly dependent on hydration status. These include renal blood flow, the glomerular filtration rate, the capacity of the kidney to reabsorb or to secrete drug molecules across the tubular epithelium, urine flow, and urine pH [<xref rid="B92-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Because of this, detoxification is commonly associated with fluid intake or hydration. In conventional medicine, toxins generally refer to drugs and alcohol, and &#x02018;detox&#x02019; is the process of weaning patients off these addictive substances. Commercially (and among laypersons), &#x0201c;detox&#x0201d; often refers to the removal of substances that may include, but are not limited to pollutants, synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, and other potentially harmful products of modern life. Little, if any, evidence exists to support the use of commercial detox diets for toxin elimination [<xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>Increased fiber and fluid consumption are typical dietary-based therapeutic approaches to functional constipation [<xref rid="B94-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,<xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Results from epidemiological studies suggest a possible relationship between low fluid intake and intestinal constipation occurrence. However, clinical trials currently do not support the use of increased fluid intake in the treatment of functional constipation. A comprehensive review of hydration and constipation in children and adolescents reported that fluid intake was ineffective in treating constipation [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Of the intervention studies we identified, one was in adults with chronic constipation and the rest were in healthy adults. Increased water intake by adults with chronic constipation increased stool frequency and decreased laxative use, while additional water consumption by healthy adults did not affect stool outcomes, suggesting a possible effect of increased hydration and improvements in stool output only in those with existing constipation. Further studies are necessary to better understand the role of water and fluids in the etiology and treatment of intestinal constipation, and study designs should include standardized evaluation tools for constipation outcomes (e.g., stool consistency, frequency of bowel movement), control for confounding dietary and lifestyle factors (e.g., fiber intake, physical activity), and measurements of hydration status and fluid intake. Additionally, published studies investigating the effect of hydration on normal functions of the gastrointestinal tract in healthy humans are lacking. Studies on dehydration and gastrointestinal function have mainly focused on exercise or gastrointestinal disorders [<xref rid="B77-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>A majority of the studies on fluid intake and weight management focused on the replacement of caloric beverages with non-caloric beverages and this has consistently resulted in lower overall energy intake [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, consumption of hypoosmotic solutions such as water may contribute to weight loss by increasing lipolysis, fat oxidation, and thermogenesis, independent of changes in caloric intake as suggested by animal studies [<xref rid="B96-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Only a handful of studies have investigated the influence of fluid intake (specifically water intake) on changes in body weight and/or body composition, independent of changes in energy intake. Existing data in adults suggest that increased water intake contributes to reductions in body fat and/or weight loss in obese adults, with or without a hypocaloric diet. Data in children/adolescents are less clear, possibly due to the smaller difference in water consumption between control and intervention groups in these studies (~350 mL/day) compared to the studies in adults (&#x0003e;800 mL/day). Adherence to the hydration regimen is a common problem reported by intervention studies in children/adolescents. Additionally, background diets were not collected in these studies, with the authors citing limitations in collecting dietary records in children/adolescent as the reason. While existing evidence show promising results for hydration and weight management, more studies are needed to confirm and clarify the effect of water intake on body weight and composition in adults and children.</p><p>Overall, assessing the totality of the hydration evidence is challenging due to the diversity in population, interventions, and trial designs across the studies. While many studies were conducted using a dehydration-rehydration design, variations in dehydration protocols (e.g., passive or active dehydration, type of exercise and environment, length of passive dehydration, extent of dehydration) and rehydration strategies (e.g., amount and timing of fluid intake) were observed. Outcome assessment tools, particularly for cognition, varied greatly, making it difficult to obtain enough evidence to clearly determine the impact of hydration on specific cognition subdomains. One of the biggest challenges with hydration studies is achieving consistency in the way hydration, dehydration, and overhydration is defined and measured. This is further complicated by the current lack of widely accepted screening tools or gold standard tests that allow for easily performable and replicable measurements of fluid balance and fluid intake. Another challenge for hydration studies is the difficulty in blinding subjects to the intervention. Possible solutions include providing intravenous fluid instead of oral hydration, although this bypasses the body&#x02019;s normal indicators of hydration status such as thirst and oropharyngeal reflexes, which may play a role in the effect of hydration on various outcomes. Therefore, it is even more important that future studies ensure blinded assessment of study outcomes.</p><p>An important gap in knowledge is the effect of small variations in hydration on health in the general population. The point at which dehydration (or rehydration) affects health indicators is not easily determined from the current body of literature. Understanding the effect of different levels of mild dehydration on health is important as a substantial number of the general US population, especially older adults, drink less than the Adequate Intake for water that was established by the IOM [<xref rid="B87-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B97-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Another gap in knowledge is the influence of sex on the effects of hydration on health as only a minority of the studies found considered both males and females. Additionally, there is also a need to consider the stage of the menstrual cycle as female sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) are known to influence body fluid regulation [<xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,<xref rid="B99-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. These are particularly important considerations for studies in which outcomes are also known to be influenced by hormones, such as cognition and mood. Finally, understanding how hydration affects health in older adults and children is also important. Many of the health outcomes discussed in this review such as weight loss, cognition, kidney stones, and constipation are highly relevant to older adults and children. Older adults are susceptible to dehydration [<xref rid="B100-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] due to various physiological (blunted thirst response, decline in kidney function) and environmental (limited mobility, inadequate assistance in nursing homes or hospital stays) factors [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which can then lead to increased morbidity [<xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="B102-nutrients-11-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Meanwhile, as reviewed here, dehydration in children may have a negative impact on cognitive development and school performance in addition to physical health. </p><p>The goal of this narrative review was to present the state of the science on hydration that is relevant to the general population. Although a systematic approach was used to identify the literature and the search was broad, the publications included may not represent all available studies and reviews on the effects of hydration and specific health areas, given only one database was used, non-English publications were excluded, and the possibility that the search terms did not reflect all relevant conditions. Finally, the studies were quite heterogeneous, making broad conclusions difficult.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-11-00070"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Water is the largest single constituent of the human body, making up approximately 60% and 75% of the adult and child human bodies, respectively. Body water deficits challenge the ability to maintain homeostasis during perturbations (e.g., sickness, physical exercise, and environmental exposure) and can affect function and health. As shown in this review, hydration status is an important aspect for health maintenance; however, evidence on the specific effects of hydration relevant to the generally healthy population is scarce and mostly inconsistent. The relationships between hydration and cognition, kidney stone risk, and weight management in generally healthy individuals are perhaps the most promising, although additional research is needed to confirm and clarify existing findings. Additional high-quality studies are needed to fill current gaps in knowledge and enable us to understand the specifics on the role of hydration in promoting health, as well as to help inform public health recommendations. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Deena Wang for assistance with the literature search and screening.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, D.L., T.B.; systematic search, screening, and data extraction, D.L., E.M.; original draft preparation, D.L., E.M.; review and editing, D.L., E.M., L.B.B., P.L.B., T.B., L.L.S.; approval of final version, D.L., E.M., L.B.B., P.L.B., T.B., L.L.S.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>Eunice Mah and DeAnn Liska received funding from PepsiCo to conduct the literature review. </p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>Authors Tristin Brisbois, Pamela L.
