    "Production of phosphorus efficient crop cultivars can increase food productivity and decrease environmental pollution. Categorization of existing germplasm is a prerequisite to develop P efficient crop cultivars. For first experiment, 30 wheat genotypes were grown in hydroponics with two P levels (i.e., deficit, 20 μm KH2PO4 and adequate, 200 μm KH2PO4). Genotypes differed significantly for various P efficiency parameters. Two genotypes (Dirk and Bhakkar-02) showed < 25% decrease in growth at P deficiency. Genotype Seher-06 proved to be inefficient. Twelve selected genotypes based on the first experiment were sown in soil with two P levels (0 and 30 mg P kg-1) till maturity. As expected, genotypes differed for grain yield at both P levels. The efficient cultivars selected on the basis of both absolute and relative dry matter production at both P levels such as Dirk. Genotypes were grouped into three, four and nine classes on the basis of various parameters for P efficiency as proposed by different researchers. Most genotypes behaved in a similar fashion by different categorization methods and also at different P supply. The method to categorize the genotypes into three classes and plotting them into 9 classes proposed by Gill and his coworkers, is the best to differentiate the minor differences in genotypes. At least three different parameters at both P regimes should be used. The parameters may vary as per objectives of the study and/or growth conditions."
