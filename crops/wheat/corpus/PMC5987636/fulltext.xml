This fact is mainly related to the ability of Fe to form highly insoluble compounds in this type of soil, mainly hydroxides-oxides and carbonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to cope with this problem plants have developed specific coordinated mechanisms, both in roots and shoots, to optimize the functional use of Fe within the plant and Fe root uptake, as well as to increase the pool of potentially available Fe in the rhizosphere. However, these mechanisms are different depending on the plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Under Fe deficiency non-graminaceous plants have evolved specific physiological responses in the root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These responses, normally known as reduction-based strategy or Strategy I, have been extensively studied and characterized at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Strategy I responses include the activation of enzymatic Fe (III) reduction at the root surface (Fe (III) chelate reductase) and Fe (II) transport activity into the root (Fe (II)-transporter). The dominant genes responsible for these processes are ferric-chelate reductase oxidase gene FRO2 and the iron regulated transporter gene IRT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The release of proton and phenolic compounds to the rhizosphere is another process included in Strategy I, inducing acidification by the activation of a root plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase coded by HA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently genes involved in phenolic efflux transporters (PEZ) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Induction of these molecular components is accompanied by morphological modifications in root architecture, such as an increase in secondary and lateral roots, absorbent hairs and transfer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">All these events in roots seem to be closely coordinated with other processes in shoots oriented to optimize the metabolic availability and use of Fe within the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In fact, even though isolated roots are able to activate root Fe-starvation main responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], it is the Fe-status in the shoot which modulates the activation of physiological Fe-starvation responses in roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">On the other hand, graminaceous plants cope with Fe-deficiency by activating root responses different from those involved in Strategy I plants. These responses, known as chelation-based strategy or Strategy II responses, include the synthesis and release to the rhizosphere of specific compounds with iron chelating properties named phytosiderophores (PS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. PS are organic compounds that belong to the family of mugineic acids synthesized from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Sequential enzymatic reactions mediated by nicotianamine synthase (NAS), nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT) and deoxymugineic acid synthase (DMAS) generate deoxymugineic acid (DMA), the precursor of all types of mugineic acids (MAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] Fe deficiency tolerance differs among species in graminaceous plants and is thought to depend mainly on the amount and types of MAs secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Fe-PS complex is then transported into root cells through a high affinity uptake root transporters, like TOM1 transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores and YS1 and YSL1 of Fe(III)-MAs complexes transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As in the case of Strategy I responses, the gene network involved in the regulation of Strategy II responses have been well characterized at both molecular and physiological levels in some model plants, such as rice and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Induction of Fe acquisition related genes help the plants cope with Fe shortage, as well as genetic regulatory factors such as DNA methylation and co-supression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and generating transgenic crops with improved nutritional traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For instance, rice secretes only small amounts of DMA among the MAs, and is more susceptible to low Fe availability compared with barley, a plant species with high capacity to produce MAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Introducing barley genome fragments containing Hv NAAT-A/B, HvNAS1 or IDS3 into rice resulted in increased DMA secretion and substantial tolerance of rice to calcareous soils under paddy conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the role of the shoot Fe status in the systemic regulation of Fe-deficiency root responses involved in their regulation remains unclear.</p><p id="Par33">Several common signaling molecules affect the Fe deficiency response, like plant hormones. Moreover, a number of studies have shown the crucial role of a coordinated action of IAA, ethylene and NO in the signaling network involved in both shoot to root communication and Fe-deficiency root responses activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Some studies reported that NO may affect Fe-deficiency root responses in graminaceous plants by improving internal Fe availability and further use efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. NO production contributes to the improvement of Fe acquisition and homeostasis by regulating the expression of Fe-related genes under Fe deficiency, such as modulating ferritin genes and its accumulation in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, NO modulated the physiological and morphological responses to Fe shortage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], like regulating lateral root formation in Fe deficient plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">With regard to ethylene (ETH) Welch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] reported that the application of the ETH precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid (ACC) to barley plants did not affect PS root release under Fe-starvation. However, the application of amino-oxiacetic acid (AOA), an ethylene inhibitor, increased PS root release but negatively affected both Fe root uptake and whole plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Romera et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] did not observe any increase of ethylene root production associated with Fe-deficiency in several graminaceous species. However, Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] observed that Fe deficiency increases ethylene root production in rice. These results are only apparently contradictory because rice seems to have both strategy I and strategy II root responses to Fe deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]; as is also the case with maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">As for a potential role of auxin-dependent signaling pathways, Qi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] described that <italic>Os</italic>ARF12, a transcription factor that activates the auxin response gene, affected Fe accumulation and distribution in rice. Furthermore, Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] also described a new gene, <italic>Os</italic>ABCB14, involved in both auxin transport and Fe homeostasis in rice. Recently, Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] reported that auxin signaling is involved in the regulation of Fe-deficiency induced impairment of photosynthetic activity and shoot growth in rice, as well as in the activation of the main gene codifying the Strategy I main responses in shoots. These results are in line with previous studies showing the relevant role of auxin in the regulation of Strategy I responses under Fe deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Bacaicoa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported that IAA is involved in the regulation at the transcriptional and functional levels of both Fe root acquisition (Fe chelate reductase, Fe transport) and rhizosphere adcidification (H+ ATPase) in cucumber plants, although through different and complementary mechanisms. However, the results concerning genes involved in Strategy II responses (<italic>Os</italic>YSL15 and <italic>Os</italic>DMAS1) were less conclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Recently, Kabir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] reported that a shoot-based auxin signaling is involved in the resistance of wheat to Fe toxicity. In summary, there exists experimental evidence suggesting that auxin is involved in Fe homeostasis in graminaceous plants but its specific role remains unclear.</p><p id="Par37">With regard to the potential role of other plant hormones, a recent study reporting the transcriptomic profiles of maize roots in response to Fe deficiency showed that genes involved in signaling pathways controlled by gibberellin, cytokinin and brassinosteroids (BRS) were significantly up-regulated. These results are in line with those reported by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] showing that BRS probably play a role in iron homeostasis in both Strategy I (cucumber) and Strategy II (rice) plants. Likewise, a recent study showed that genes also regulated by jasmonate were also upregulated in rice plants subjected to Fe deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In this framework, it is possible that Fe-deficient root responses in graminaceous plants are also modulated by the shoot Fe status through signaling pathways involving one or several phytoregulators. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we have studied whether the Fe-status in the shoot modulates PS secretion in roots, as well as the role of IAA, NO and ethylene in the regulation of this process, in wheat plants subjected to Fe deficiency. With this aim, we have used a pharmacological approach involving inhibitors of the biosynthesis and/or action of IAA, ethylene and NO. Likewise, the role played by the shoot Fe-status in PS root release was also assessed through foliar FeSO<sub>4</sub> resupply to Fe-starved wheat plants.

In Strategy I plants, a number of studies have shown that, though roots are able &#x0201c;per se&#x0201d; to activate Fe-starvation root responses, the systemic regulation of these responses depends on the Fe-status in the shoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Several studies have proposed that the dominant role of the shoot in the activation of Fe-deficiency responses in roots is probably also present in Strategy II plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there is no experimental evidence supporting this assessment. In Strategy I plants, this question has been tackled by using split-root experiments and/or Fe-foliar application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While Fe-foliar application allows us to study whether Fe-deficiency root responses are governed by shoot Fe-status (systemic regulation), split-root experiments also allow the discrimination between local and systemic shoot-root signal regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In the present study, we have employed the Fe-foliar re-supply approach in order to investigate the role of the shoot in the fine control of the activation of the studied Fe-deficiency root responses in wheat. If Fe-deficiency in the shoot governs the activation of these Fe-deficiency responses in roots, the application of available Fe to leaves of plants suffering Fe-deficiency must significantly reduce the expression of Fe-deficient root responses, as observed in Strategy I plants. Our results clearly showed this fact. The Fe foliar application to Fe-starved and deficient plants led to the gradual reduction in both PS root release and <italic>TaNAAT</italic> gene expression compared to control Fe-deficient plants. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that other genes concerning DMA synthesis (i.e. <italic>TaDMAS1</italic>) are upregulated in wheat root under Fe deficiency but they remain unchanged in the shoot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. These results indicate that the presence of Fe-deficiency in leaves plays a major role in the activation of the studied Fe-starvation root responses in wheat, a Strategy II plant species.</p><p id="Par73">With regard to the nature of the signaling pathways involved in the activation of Fe-deficient root responses in graminaceous plants, current knowledge is very limited. In Strategy I plants a number of studies have shown that this process is rather complex and possibly involves both repressive and activating signals likely related to Fe-transporter compounds along with hormone-regulated signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, hormonal pathways integrate a coordinated action of auxin in shoot and root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and ethylene-NO in roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In graminaceous plants, recent results showed that many genes related to plant hormone signaling (ethylene, auxin, nitric oxide, cytokinin, jasmonate&#x02026;), responded to Fe-deficiency stress, thus suggesting the involvement of a complex hormonal signaling network in the fine regulation of Fe-deficiency induced root responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Some results have suggested that ethylene might play a role in the positive regulation of Fe-deficiency root responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. If this is correct, the application of inhibitors of ethylene functionality must block the expression of Fe-deficiency root responses in Fe-starved and deficient graminaceous plants. However, our results clearly showed that the application of both Co<sup>2+</sup>, an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, and STS, an inhibitor of ethylene action, did not cause any decrease in the expression or intensity of PS root release and <italic>TaNAAT</italic> gene expression compared with Fe-deficient plants in wheat. In principle, this fact indicates that ethylene does not positively regulate the evolvement of these Fe-deficiency root responses in wheat. This conclusion is in line with the results reported by Romera et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], who did not observe any increase in ethylene root production in barley, maize and wheat plants subjected to Fe-deficiency, and Welch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] who did not observe any change in PS root release upon ACC (a precursor of ethylene synthesis) application to barley plants. The results reported by Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], who observed an increase in ethylene root production in Fe-deficient rice plants, might be due to the fact that rice shares some Strategy I and Strategy II Fe-deficiency root responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">On the contrary, the application of STS caused a slight but significant increase in PS root release after 4&#x000a0;h, although it did not affect the root <italic>TaNAAT</italic> up-regulation associated with Fe-deficiency. These results are in line with those reported by Welch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], who observed an increase of PS root efflux upon AOA application in barley. In principle, these results may be linked to the fact that ethylene competes with nicotinamine (NA) for the S-Adenosyl methionine availability for their respective synthetic pathways, and blocking ethylene function may favor NA-pathway and PS biosynthesis under Fe starvation. However, the physiological meaning of this result is dubious, since ethylene function is crucial for normal plant development and blocking ethylene functionality negatively affect major metabolic pathways and physiological processes. In fact, Welch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] reported that despite the increase in PS root efflux caused by AOA, both plant growth and Fe root uptake were clearly impaired by AOA application.</p><p id="Par76">Several studies have clearly stated that NO was able to improve internal Fe availability in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This fact might be related in some way to the NO-ability to promote ferritin accumulation and Fe-storage in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this framework, it would be possible that NO also plays a role in the regulation of Fe-deficiency root responses in graminaceous plants through the control of Fe remobilization within the plant. In this sense, it was is possible that the inhibition of NO signaling pathway by c-PTIO would decrease ferritin and increase free Fe in the shoot thus alleviating Fe deficiency and decreasing PS root release and root TaNAAT up-regulation. Nevertheless, our results showed that NO does not affect the PS root release associated with Fe deficiency. Similar results were observed concerning root <italic>TaNAAT</italic> gene expression, which presented up-regulation levels similar to those of Fe-deficient plants. As in the case of STS root application, c-PTIO caused a slight but significant increase of PS root release compared with Fe-deficient plants after 4&#x000a0;h. In contrast to the dubious physiological meaning of effects derived from the inhibition of ethylene action, the effects on Fe-deficiency root responses resulting from the NO-action inhibition might be much more meaningful. In this sense, as stated above, NO-mediated improvement of internal Fe availability might be linked to its ability to modulate ferritin accumulation in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Ferritins are proteins located in the chloroplasts where accumulation is induced by an excess of iron. NO mediates transcriptional regulation of ferritin genes by regulating an iron-dependent regulatory sequence (IDRS), a cis-acting element that depresses the expression of several ferritin genes under Fe overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this context, blocking NO functionality may also affect ferritin biosynthesis in leaves of Fe-deficient plants, thus affecting ferritin gene <italic>TaFer1</italic> expression. However, c-PTIO application did not increase the down-regulation of <italic>TaFer1</italic> associated with Fe-deficiency. This result do not exclude that <italic>TaFer1</italic> down-regulation is not linked to the inhibition of NO-dependent signaling pathways but that other signals trigger by Fe deficiency, which may be related to other IDRS elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], are also involved.</p><p id="Par77">The relevant role played by auxin in the activation of Fe-deficiency root responses in Strategy I plants has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, auxin action in the activation of Strategy II plant responses has not been directly studied yet. Some studies reported that genes closely related to auxin transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] seem to be involved in the regulation of Fe-homeostasis in rice. These results suggested that auxin could also play some role in the activation of Fe-deficiency root responses in graminaceous plants. However, the fact that rice also has Strategy I Fe-deficiency root responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] makes it difficult to investigate this issue using this plant species. Our results show that the application of PCIB, an inhibitor of IAA-action, caused a gradual decrease of both PS root release and root <italic>TaNAAT</italic> gene expression over time in comparison with Fe-deficient plants. This result indicates that IAA is essential for the activation of Fe-deficiency root responses in wheat.</p><p id="Par78">The results obtained from TIBA application, an inhibitor of IAA-transport, were also meaningful. TIBA-treated plants showed a rapid decrease in the <italic>TaNAAT</italic> gene up-regulation caused by Fe-deficiency that was expressed 4&#x000a0;h upon TIBA application. However this effect disappeared after longer times. On the other hand PS root release had a different pattern of variation after TIBA application, showing no increase for all harvest times. In principle, these results suggest that auxin controls <italic>TaNAAT</italic> expression and PS root release through different pathways. The fact that PCIB blocked both <italic>TaNAAT</italic> expression and PS root release suggests that the effects observed with TIBA may be related to the IAA distribution in the different root zones where the regulated biochemical events occur. Dependence of root local processes on IAA local root distribution has been previously reported in Arabidopsis concerning IAA-mediated root morphological changes induced by Fe-deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Further studies are needed in order to clarify this issue.</p><p id="Par79">In contrast to Strategy I plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Fe-deficiency did not cause any increase in the root concentration of IAA, but a significant decrease in both root and shoot. Furthermore, the application of Fe on the leaves of Fe-deficient plants caused an additional decrease of IAA root concentrations. These results suggest that IAA local distribution in roots might be much more relevant than total plant IAA concentration in the main role of IAA in the activation of Fe-deficiency root responses in graminaceous plants. In this sense, other authors also observed that some auxin-dependent processes, such as the alteration in the pattern of lateral root (LR) formation and emergence in response to phosphate (Pi) availability in Arabidopsis, were related to changes in auxin receptor sensitivity but not to root IAA concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Nevertheless, the conversion of IAA into conjugated forms with higher auxin activity is also possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In fact, the decrease in IAA observed in our experiments in plants subjected to Fe starvation was associated with a concomitant increase in several IAA conjugated forms, principally IAA-aspartate and IAA-Glutamate (unpublished results). Although aminoacid conjugation has been related to hormonal activation in the case of JA and JA-isoleucine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and with hormonal deactivation in the case of IAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], recent studies showed that IAA-Aspartate has a regulatory function in pathogen infection and plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It is therefore possible that any of the conjugated forms promoted by Fe deficiency is involved in root plant responses to Fe deficiency in graminaceous. More studies are required in order to shed light on this issue.</p><p id="Par80">Our results suggest that auxin might also be involved in the shoot to root signaling network regulating root responses to Fe deficiency in Strategy II plants. On the one hand, as discussed earlier, both TIBA and PCIB root applications to Fe-deficient plants were associated with a decrease in IAA root concentration, with these effects being linked to significant decreases in PS root. On the other hand, IAA application was able to promote both root <italic>TaNAAT</italic> up-regulation and PS root release in Fe-sufficient wheat plants. However, the time-course pattern of the variation of the two evaluated parameters in Fe-sufficient plants upon IAA application was different from that of Fe-deficient plants. This fact indicates that other factors, which may be related to a kind of repressive signal as in the case of Strategy I system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], are probably involved in the complex signaling network responsible for the shoot-mediated regulation of Fe-deficiency root responses in graminaceous plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par81">The results obtained in the present study show that the evolvement of Fe-deficiency in the shoot regulates the activation of the studied Fe-deficiency root responses. Furthermore, auxin plays an essential role in the control of the release of PS from the root to the rhizosphere in wheat plants subjected to Fe starvation and deficiency. The results were also compatible with a role of IAA in the shoot regulation of Fe-deficiency root responses in Fe-deficient wheat plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The results suggest the possible relevance of IAA local concentration and redistribution in specific root regions as well as the involvement of IAA conjugated forms with higher auxin activity, in the whole action of IAA on the activation of Fe-deficiency root responses. On the other hand, ethylene and NO did not clearly modulate the studied Fe-deficiency root responses in wheat. However, an indirect effect of NO cannot be ruled out since this molecule is able to improve internal Fe availability and use in the shoot, thus delaying Fe-deficiency response.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for the role of indole acetic acid (IAA) in the modulation of root responses to Fe deficiency in non graminaceous and graminaceous plants (ETH: ethylene; NO: nitric oxide) (This figure was drawn by M.G, R.B. and J.M.
