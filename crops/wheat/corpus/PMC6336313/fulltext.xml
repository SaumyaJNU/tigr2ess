Considering the high prevalence of allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents, caregivers should be given appropriate information regarding the disease course. This study aimed to understand the prognosis of allergic rhinitis by examining the relationship between allergic sensitization and rhinitis symptoms during this developmental period.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study included 1069 children aged 9&#x02013;16 years from the Korean International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Survey database who had completed health questionnaires, and for whom skin prick test results were available.

Conversely, the proportion of rhinitis symptoms among sensitized children decreased as age increased (58.80%, 52.90%, 49.70%, respectively; p = 0.047).

This suggests that the symptoms of later-sensitized children are less clearly manifested, or that the symptoms reduce as previously sensitized children mature.

The prevalence of AR shows an increasing trend worldwide, especially among school-aged children [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether AR in a specific child will deteriorate or develop into asthma or other allergic diseases; moreover, caregivers require counseling regarding how their children&#x02019;s diseases are likely to change over time. It is presumed that the prevalence of AR increases from childhood to young adulthood, and decreases thereafter [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, there has not been sufficient research regarding the characteristics of AR in school-aged children.</p><p>Recent studies based on a more controlled environmental background have shown a decline in the prevalence of AR as children mature (34.5% in preschool-aged children vs. 16.2% in adults) [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, previous studies only showed changes in prevalence with aging, and there have been no studies regarding how existing allergic symptoms have changed with age in sensitized children.</p><p>This study investigated the clinical characteristics of AR in Korean school-aged children by analyzing the relationship between age-specific allergen sensitization and the presence of rhinitis symptoms; the goal of the study was to provide counseling guidelines to parents and caregivers regarding changes in children&#x02019;s AR characteristics over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study population</title><p>Six elementary schools, three middle schools, and four high schools located in Jeju and Seogwipo City, Jeju Island, were selected.

Surprisingly, although the rate of allergen sensitization increased with age, the extent of rhinitis symptoms in sensitized children decreased with age; in contrast, non-allergic rhinitis symptoms revealed a growth-independent pattern.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated allergen sensitization and overt allergic symptoms. Several studies have shown that sensitization to inhaled allergens increases with age in children [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in studies of adults, the frequency and severity of AR tended to decline with age [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One of the factors affecting sensitization to various allergens is the living environment, which is related to the frequency of exposure [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The sensitization rate is speculated to incrementally increase with frequent exposure to the antigen. Compared with children, adults are more frequently sensitized to nearly all pollen allergens, which are representative of seasonal allergens. As children mature, the likelihood of exposure to outdoor antigens increases; this was supported by the current findings indicative of increasing seasonal allergen sensitization with age. Subsequent allergen exposure in pre-sensitized children leads to an increase in basophils and mast cells, which mediate IgE release; this results in symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, or itching sensation. However, a previous study found that sensitization and overt symptoms are not always correlated; thus, the etiology has not yet been fully explained [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Sherrill et al. reported that early-sensitized children had a high risk of asthma occurrence and severe allergic symptoms, whereas mild symptoms were present in late-sensitized children [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the present study is cross-sectional and we had no information regarding the time point when each of the children became sensitized, the aforementioned research and other recent results suggest that the cumulative prevalence of sensitization increases with age, and that less obvious symptoms are present in newly-sensitized individuals.</p><p>A previous study showed that overall AR symptoms tend to become milder with age, and that allergic reactivity decreases after an average follow-up of 22.9 years, with no direct association between changes in symptom severity and test results [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The incidence and severity of allergic symptoms both tend to decrease with age. The decline in the onset of allergic symptoms observed with ageing might be due to reductions in serum total and specific IgE levels [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our results may also be a sign of this long-term change.</p><p>There is another possible explanation for age-related changes in the level of causative allergens; the threshold may be lower at a younger age. When exposure to an allergen is below the threshold needed to elicit symptoms, weak inflammatory infiltration occurs in the nasal mucosa; this leads to absence of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Notably, low-grade, continuous, subclinical allergic inflammation has been reported, even in the absence of symptoms, in individuals with seasonal AR and those with perennial AR [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although there is no evidence supporting this suggestion that the threshold for allergen exposure changes with age, the increase in the proportion of children with subclinical AR in the present study suggests that this may be a possibility. Future studies should investigate whether subclinical AR persists silently, even into adulthood.</p><p>As a management strategy for allergic diseases, the primary step is prevention of immune sensitization; the second is prevention of allergic symptom development in sensitized individuals; and the third is treatment of allergic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The findings of the present study, which was designed to elucidate changes in the process between the first and second stages described above, may form the basis for identifying the pathophysiology underlying the transition from sensitization to manifestation of allergic symptoms.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, we showed that asymptomatic allergic sensitization increased with age in school-aged children; however, asymptomatic skin sensitization may be a risk factor for later allergy development [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, longitudinal studies in children with asymptomatic sensitization are needed to confirm the clinical implications of our findings. Second, SPTs were used to confirm allergic sensitization; however, SPT results could change over time and may also be false-positive or false-negative. Therefore, these results should be cautiously interpreted. Third, there may be errors in recall when investigating AR through a questionnaire, without physical examination, and there may be differences in the tolerance reported by children for specific symptoms. In order to overcome these limitations, it is necessary to investigate serum eosinophil percentage and total IgE concentration in a longitudinal study; these parameters have previously been associated with the development of allergic symptoms and allergic sensitization [<xref rid="pone.0210840.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The presence of rhinological manifestations declines with age in children sensitized to allergens.
