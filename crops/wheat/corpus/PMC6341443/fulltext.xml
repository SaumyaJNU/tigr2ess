In addition, the high workload burden of women in households and in agricultural activities increases their likelihood of being malnourished (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Further, women in low income countries are at a greater risk of not meeting their nutrient requirements (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In Sub-Saharan Africa the prevalence of chronic energy deficiency among women is 10&#x02013;20% (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In low income countries including Ethiopia, 20&#x02013;25% of women are underweight (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Household food insecurity, low dietary diversity score, low level of educational status and high burden of reproduction were reported as determinants of maternal undernutrition in Ethiopia (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>There are increased physiological needs during lactation, reflected in higher nutritional requirements. Failure to gain the necessary weight has a negative impact on maternal health as well as milk quality and quantity (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thus, measuring the prevalence of undernutrition through dietary intakes and measurement of body weight status during lactation can assist in determining the underlying factors.</p><p>There is limited data on prevalence of maternal undernutrition among lactating women in Ethiopia. In Jimma, prevalence of 40.6% was reported (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and in Tigray, it was less, at 25% (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Poor food intake manifest as low diet diversity score was identified as a main predictor of maternal underweight (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In contrast, external factors such as size of farm land, length of years of marriage, maize cultivation, frequency of antenatal care visit and age of breastfeeding child were identified (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The micronutrients of concern during lactation are zinc, calcium, vitamin A and vitamin C (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). By understanding the link between intake and barriers to adequate intake, it may be possible to correct undernutrition in lactating women in Ethiopia.</p><p>To address lack of information on nutrition needs of lactating women in Ethiopia, this study set out to assess the magnitude of undernutrition among exclusive breastfeeding women and to determine important contributing factors including usual dietary practices. In Arba Minch Zuriya districts where the research is conducted, studies regarding nutrition in lactating women are very limited. The nutritional status as affected by dietary practices and other contributing factors of underweight among the lactating women from this study can be added to existing evidence in Ethiopia to use for policy development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Study area</bold>: Arba Minch Zuriya is a rural administrative district in the Gamo Gofa zone and is located 505 km away from Addis Ababa. The district has 29 kebeles, with a total estimated population of 200,000. The total number of reproductive age women in the study area was 27,202 of which there were 5140 who were lactating (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The mean annual daily temperature ranges 15.1 to 25.0 &#x000b0;C. Maize, sorghum, wheat, barley and teff are the primary crops are produced. Moringa stenopetella and kale are among the most consumed staple vegetables; common fruits are banana and mango. According to the woreda office, seven health centers and 29 health posts provide health services for the community.</p><p><bold>Study design and sample</bold>: This was a community-based cross-sectional study with both descriptive and analytic elements, carried out from May to June 2015. The study population comprised women who had given birth within six months prior to data collection and were living in randomly selected kebeles of the study area. Women who had gave birth less than 45 days at the time of recruitment, those who were seriously ill and the ones who could not be found at home after three consecutive visits were excluded. Sample size was determined using single population proportion formula. The inputs were a 95% of confidence level, a 5% of margin of error, a 25% estimated prevalence of maternal underweight (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), a design effect of 1.5 and a 10% of non-response rate. The sample size was found as 478.</p><p><bold>Sampling procedure</bold>: A Multistage cluster sampling procedure was followed. The kebeles in the district were stratified to Woinadega, Kola and Dega agroecology areas. Then, the total sample size was divided to the three strata proportionally to their population size. From each stratum, eight kebeles (4 from Woinadega, 3 from Kola and 1 from Dega) were selected at random and the sample size for each stratum was distributed to the kebeles proportional to their population size. Sampling frame was prepared for each household with lactating women, who were identified with the help of health development army. Study subjects were selected using systematic random sampling.</p><p><bold>Data collection procedures and quality assurance</bold>: The structured questionnaire was derived from different standard questionnaires (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The questionnaire was prepared in English. The final version was translated into Amharic and then re-translated into English. Diploma teachers who were good at Amharic and local languages (Gamogna and Zeisegna) were recruited. The questionnaire included sociodemographic, socio-economic, health and reproductive history and dietary intake/diversity.</p><p>A food frequency questionnaire listing food groups consumed the previous day was used to calculate dietary diversity score (DDS) of lactating women. DDS was calculated as the number of food groups out of a possible nine were consumed over the past 24 hours. A high dietary diversity was considered if &#x02265; six food groups, medium if 4 four to five 5 food groups and low if &#x02264; three or less food groups (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) were consumed in the specified period. A repeated quantitative 24-hour dietary recall was used to collect quantitative data from sub-sample of 73 study participants (15% of total sample size) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) to assess mean intake of calorie, calcium, zinc, iron and vitamin A. To account for the &#x02018;day of the week effects&#x02019; one weekday and one market day were represented.</p><p>Anthropometric data was collected by measuring weight and height of lactating women using calibrated equipment and standardized techniques (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a fixed stadiometer with vertical backboard and movable headboard. Measurements were taken with the women standing erect with feet parallel and buttocks, shoulders and back of head touching the wall. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). Subjects were classified as underweight if BMI &#x0003c; 18.5 (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) was used to assess household food security (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The tool had nine questions each having four answer options in a recall period of 30 days. The precoded options were never (0 points), rarely (once or twice in the past 4 weeks; 1 point), sometimes (three to ten times in the past 4 weeks; 2 points), and often (more than ten times in the past 4 weeks; 3 points). Scores for answers to these questions were summed (0&#x02013;27) and households classified as four level of household food insecurity. The higher the score, the more food insecurity a household experienced.</p><p>Food security was defined as follows. Households who experienced none of the food insecurity conditions were categorized as &#x0201c;food secure&#x0201d;, but household worries about not having enough food sometimes or often in the last four weeks were &#x0201c;mildly food insecure&#x0201d;. A &#x0201c;moderately food insecure&#x0201d; household sacrificed quality more frequently, by eating monotonous diet or undesirable foods sometimes or often, but did not experience any of the severe conditions (running out of food, going to bed hungry, or going a whole day and night without eating) which are characteristic of &#x0201c;severely food insecure&#x0201d; households.</p><p>To assure data quality, training was given to data collectors and supervisors on all procedures. Pretest was carried out on 5% of the study sample on kebeles not included in this study. Data collectors' accuracy of anthropometric measurements was standardized prior to the study. The principal investigator supervised all data collection. Filled copies of the questionnaire were checked for their completeness every day after data collection.</p><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Hawassa University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences. Further permission was obtained from Arba Minch Zuriya Woreda Health Office, and explanation about the purpose of the survey and the benefits was provided to study participants in order to obtain their verbal or written consent. Confidentiality of the data was maintained.</p><p>The independent variables were socioeconomic factors, household food insecurity, family size, housing condition, work load, parity, birth to pregnancy interval, frequency of breast feeding, meal frequency, dietary diversity, antenatal care, place of delivery and access to nutrition information during pregnancy or postpartum. The dependent variables were work load, parity, birth to pregnancy interval, frequency of breast feeding, meal frequency, dietary diversity, antenatal care, place of delivery and access to nutrition information (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p><bold>Data analysis</bold>: Tolerance test &#x0003c;2 was used to check the absence of multi-co-linearity. Variables were checked for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnove test (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Descriptive summaries, frequencies and proportions were found. Logistic regression was employed to assess the association between dependent and independent variables. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was used to assess strength of association, and p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was statistical significance. The amount of consumed foods and drinks obtained from repeated 24 hr recall data was converted to grams. Nutrients values were computed using Ethiopian (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and African (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) food composition tables. Since the data was not normally distributed, median energy and nutrient intake values were computed and compared with the recommended dietary intake (RDA) for lactating women (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Wealth index was computed using principal component analysis (PCA) as a composite indicator of living standard, initially based on 19 variables related to ownership of valuable assets, livestock, size of agricultural land and materials used for house construction (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A score of &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; was given for each of 14 binary variables; for the remaining five variables, different scoring systems were used. Variables (sources of water, sanitary facility and ownership of kerosene) were removed from analysis as they had low communality score. Five categories (poorest, poorer, middle, richer and richest) were generated as approximately equal quintiles.</p><p>In order to identify factors associated with maternal underweight, logistic regression analysis was used. Two models were developed separately for proximal and distal independent variables. Variables at binary logistic analysis with a p-value of less than 0.25 were subsequently included in the multivariate analysis. The adequacy of the model was checked by using Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><bold>Socio-demographics:</bold> Data for subjects (478 exclusively breast-feeding women) is in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

The high prevalence (40.6%) of underweight among lactating women in Jimma occurred where women were enrolled in a nutrition intervention project. In our study area, farmers produced income-generating fruit (banana, mango), thus were less disadvantaged. Overall, short birth-to-pregnancy interval, workload burden, low wealth index, household food insecurity and less nutrition information were factors significantly associated with underweight.</p><p>The maternal depletion syndrome hypothesizes that mothers with a short birth-to-pregnancy interval do not have adequate time to replenish macro- and micro-nutrients (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Indeed, in rural Nigeria, a higher risk of underweight was observed in those women who conceived before 23 months after a previous birth (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A systematic review (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) revealed reduced maternal fat stores in those who have short birth-to-pregnancy interval.</p><p>Workload due to labour intensive activities increased the risk of women's underweight by three-fold. Engaging in high physical activity is a burden for women as it increases energy expenditure. Similarly, a study done among lactating Senegalese women (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) shows weight loss due to negative energy balance associated with agricultural labour.</p><p>Food insecurity is a major challenge for Ethiopia especially in women and children (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this study, women from food secure households had a better nutritional status compared to women from food insecure households, consistent with other Ethiopian studies (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Women who got counseled on nutrition were 73% less likely to have low BMI. The result is supported by a study done in Addis Ababa that found improved dietary practices of pregnant women after nutrition education intervention (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Women's educational status was reported as a determinant of women's malnutrition (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) in developing countries, as we found. The reason might be the fact that unemployment, low income and low decision making power of illiterate women made them less likely to access nutritious food.</p><p>According to Food and Agriculture Organization (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), lactating women should increase their energy intake by a minimum of 550 kcal to compensate for the cost of energy due to lactation. However, the median energy intake of lactating women in this study was lower than this standard, as also reported in the Tigray study (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This low median caloric intake might be related to insufficient number of meals per day, which was reported in the study by 82%.</p><p>Some micronutrient intakes were low, such as calcium and zinc. These are nutrient concerns among Ethiopian and other sub-Saharan women (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Mean vitamin A intake was higher than the recommendation, in contrast to findings in Tigray (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, the Ethiopian Food Consumption Survey (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) reported SNNPR as having higher than average vitamin A intakes due to availability of vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables. Similar to other studies, data on dietary iron consumption of Ethiopian women (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and in particular lactating women (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), dietary iron consumption for most of lactating women in this study was adequate.</p><p>Limitations include conducting dietary assessment using only two days of participant intakes in a sub-sample, which might not indicate the usual intake. This study is cross-sectional wherein one cannot assume a cause and effect relationship. Additionally, body mass index was measured in women who may not have attained their pre-pregnancy weight, and therefore, we may have under-estimated underweight (BMI&#x0003c;18.5) prevalence.</p><p>In conclusion, close to one-sixth of the studied exclusively breastfeeding women were underweight. Most women had inadequate intakes of energy, calcium and zinc. The factors associated with maternal underweight were short birth-to-pregnancy intervals, high domestic and farm workload, low level of education, household food insecurity and limited exposure to nutrition information. Hence, health extension workers should give routine nutrition counseling, during these critical periods, about dietary practices, optimal birth spacing and its nutritional outcomes for the child and the women dietary practices and optimal birth spacing. Emphasis should be given to labour saving technologies for women to reduce the work burden, enhance household food security and women education in order to improve the nutritional status of women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lartey</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Maternal and child nutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and interventions</article-title><source>Proc Nutr Soc</source><year>2008</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>105</fpage><lpage>108</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18234138</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab collab-type="author">FAO</collab><source>Gender Equality and Food Security.
