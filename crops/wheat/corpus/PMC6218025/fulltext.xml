In the present study, we <italic>de novo</italic> assembled the root transcriptomes in reference cultivar Chinese Spring from RNA-seq reads generated by the 454-GS-FLX and HiSeq platforms. The FLX reads were assembled into 24,986 transcripts with completeness of 54.84%, and the HiSeq reads were assembled into 91,543 high-confidence protein-coding transcripts, 2,404 low-confidence protein-coding transcripts, and 13,181 non-coding transcripts with the completeness of &#x0003e;90%. Combining the FLX and HiSeq assemblies, we assembled a root transcriptome of 92,335 ORF-containing transcripts. Approximately 7% of the coding transcripts and ~2% non-coding transcripts are not present in the current wheat genome assembly. Functional annotation of both assemblies showed similar gene ontology patterns and that ~7% coding and &#x0003e;5% non-coding transcripts are root-specific. Transcription quantification identified 1,728 differentially expressed transcripts between root tips and maturation zone, and functional annotation of these transcripts captured a transcriptional signature of longitudinal development of wheat root. With the transcriptomic resources developed, this study provided the first view of wheat root transcriptome under different developmental zones and laid a foundation for molecular studies of wheat root development and growth using a reverse genetic approach.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20186701427360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5886-1426</contrib-id><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wanlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research is supported by a USDA-NIFA project (20186701427360 to Wl) and Research/Scholarship Support Fund from South Dakota State University.

A well-developed root system is critical for sustainable crop production. Despite the important roles in plant development and growth, our understanding of root development and growth is still very limited as compared to the aboveground half. Nevertheless, most knowledge of root biology comes from the model plant Arabidopsis. Rich genomic resources, non-soil cultivation and anatomical simplicity make the Arabidopsis root state of the art in plant biology at both molecular and cellular levels, including identification of many genes involving various aspects of root development, characterization of hormone interaction, cell type definition, and environmental responses [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dicots and monocots differ significantly in root system architecture and cellular organization. Compared to the tap root system in dicots, monocot roots are fibrous with large quiescent centers, the separate origin of endodermis and cortex in ground tissue, multiple layers of cortical cells with variable cell numbers, and multiple-tissue occurrence of lateral roots [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With a finished genome and relative ease of genetic transformation, rice has emerged a model for grass root biology study and has proven to be informative [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, very little information is available in the small-grain crops, including barley, oats, rye, and wheat, which grow in relatively dry conditions and have large genomes.</p><p>Common wheat or bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L., genomes AABBDD) is a hexaploid species of relatively recent origin and one of the most important food sources, providing ~20% daily caloric consumption. As the most widely adapted crop, wheat plays an important role in the global food security. Mainly due to climate change, however, wheat production is facing numerous challenges from biotic stress and abiotic stress. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying root development, growth and the environmental response is a prerequisite for improving tolerance to the soil-borne stress, such as drought and waterlogging, using biotech approaches. Functional genomics has long been expected to play an important role in wheat root studies. Of the ~1.3 million wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from 147 complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries, 26,849 ESTs of 25 cDNA libraries were made from the root tissues of reference genotype Chinese Spring (CS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). But they are far apart from covering the root transcriptome, particularly for those transcripts that are low in abundance but important in function, such as transcription factors (TFs). Compared to the traditional EST development and microarray hybridization, RNA-Seq offers unprecedented capacity and resolution in revealing the landscape and dynamics of complex transcriptomes. As the sequencing cost continues to drop, RNA-Seq has been the favorite choice for transcriptome analysis of the non-model plant species [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Without finished genome sequences, the transcriptomes of the non-model species are assembled <italic>de novo</italic>. Although draft genome sequences of common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the A-genome [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and D-genome progenitors of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] were reported recently, their utility in transcriptome analysis remains to be tested. Many RNA analyses have been performed in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Half of these researches assembled the transcriptomes <italic>de novo</italic> due to lack of a finished wgeat genome assembly. In another aspect, a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly also benefits annotation of the wheat genome by identifying the novel genes that are not included in the current gene models and improving the current annotation.</p><p>Most of the transcriptomes assembled were mainly for aboveground tissues such as the embryogenic callus [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], developing grains [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], spikes [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], microspores [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], leaves [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], or mixed tissues from whole plants [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. No transcriptomes have been assembled for root development study. To gain a global view of the allelic interaction and its effect on the root transcriptome at large and to lay a foundation for root functional genomics, we initiated a wheat root transcriptome project. As the first stage, we sequenced the three root RNA samples of CS using 454 GS-FLX (Roche, Branford, CT, USA) and HiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) platforms. Assembly and quantification of the wheat root transcriptomes provide the first view of the transcriptional landscape of wheat root development. Here, we report the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the root transcriptomes, characterization of the assembled transcripts, expression profiling of the genes in the root tip and the mature part of the roots, and their implication to wheat root development and growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and RNA extraction</title><p>Root tissues collected from two separate germination experiments for RNASeq analysis by 454/Roche and Illumina sequencing platforms.

The assemblies were analyzed for various parameters, including the number of reads used, the total number of contigs generated, number of contigs longer than 200bp, N50 length, longest contig length and average contig length, and mapped the reads back onto the assembled contigs to estimate the number of unmapped reads. A total of six assemblies were generated (<xref rid="pone.0205582.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As expected, an increase of sequence identity reduces N50, longest contig and average contig size, number of reads used and the size of the assemblies, but increases the number of contigs and singletons. One exception to this is the largest contig length for the assembly with 97% identity, which is smaller than that of the assembly with the identity of 98%. The 454 FLX reads were also assembled with other programs including MIRA and TGICL separately, and the quality of these assemblies was analyzed using the same output parameters used for the Newbler assemblies (<xref rid="pone.0205582.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The TGICL assembly generated more contigs (78,413) than any of the assemblies from Newbler or the MIRA. But the largest contig assembled and N50 was the smallest compared to the other assemblies. The assemblies generated by TGICL and MIRA are larger (50.3 and 52.43 Mbp) than the six assemblies generated by the Newbler (<xref rid="pone.0205582.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Although the Newbler assembly with 95% identity has the largest contig size and N50, use of a lower identity would increase the probability of merging the homoeologous transcripts as the homeologs from sub-genomes of wheat are known to have high similarity over 97% identity in coding sequences [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

The program predicted ORFs in 116,833 transcript sequences, and the remaining 26,061 sequences had no coding capacity. Of the 116,833 ORF-containing transcripts, 4,727 sequences had premature stop codons, and 18,000 sequences had frame-shifts in their ORFs, suggesting that these 22,727 sequences were transcribed from pseudogenes. For the 94,106 transcripts that contain normal ORFs, running an iterative step of findorf with the first ORF masked found that 6,158 sequences contained a second ORF, suggesting that they were derived from misassemblies during the <italic>de novo</italic> assembly process. Therefore, a total of 87,948 transcripts contain unique ORFs. Further annotation of the 26,061 transcripts, from which no ORFs were predicted by findorf, using outputs of BLASTx against NCBI nr database predicted ORFs in 9,987 transcripts. Of these 9,987 transcripts, 4,244 transcripts were found to be pseudogenes with a frameshift or a premature stop codon in the ORF. And an iterative run with the masked ORF sequence found 2,148 transcripts were containing a second ORF. Thus, 3,595 transcripts were identified with a functional ORF, increasing the total transcripts with a predicted functional ORF to 91,543. These transcripts were considered high-confidence (HC) protein-coding transcripts.</p><p>The findorf program did not predict any ORF in the remaining 16,074 transcripts. Using TransDecoder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder">https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder</ext-link>), we identified only a single putatively functional ORFs in 2,404 of these 16,074 transcript sequences based on the pfam domain and the BLASTP hit against the SWISSPROT database. These 2,404 transcripts are therefore considered low-confidence (LC) protein-coding transcripts.</p><p>The remaining 13,181 transcripts were left over without any predicted ORF present and further analyzed using the potential coding calculator (CPC). Of the 13,181 transcripts, 189 showed coding potential with the score ranging from 3.999 to 0.008, 12,705 showed no coding potential with a potential coding score ranging from -0.008 to -1.572, and 287 transcripts had no results returned by CPC. Considering that LC proteins are not confirmed in other plant genomes and due to the very low CPC for the noncoding transcripts, they were pooled and referred as non-ORF transcripts hereafter.</p><p>We aligned the 91,543 ORF-containing transcripts and 16,074 non-ORF transcripts with the current version of the wheat genome assembly [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The results showed that 58,341 (63.7%) ORF-transcripts found matches in whole genome sequence with &#x0003e;97% identity and &#x0003e;50% length coverage.

Of the 10,931 matched non-ORF transcripts, 2,343 hit the predicted cDNA sequences with same parameters and remaining 8,588 only found matches in the wheat genome assembly but not in the predicted cDNA, suggesting that they are located either in the intergenic regions or introns.

Of the 107,617 transcripts (91,543 orf-transcripts + 16,074 non-ORF transcripts) assembled from the HiSeq reads, a total of 1,728 transcripts were found differentially expressed between the root tip and mature root tissues according to a comparison of expression levels with fold change (FC) &#x02265; 2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of &#x02264; 0.05. Out of these 1,728, 1083 transcripts were more abundant in root tips, and 645 transcripts were more abundant in the matured part of the root. A search of the NCBI nr database and the Arabidopsis TAIR database annotated 1,647 of the 1,728 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs). Remaining 81 transcripts had no annotation in both the databases, of which 27 transcripts have functional ORFs but do not have a match in the two databases used, whereas 54 were non-ORF transcripts, representing putative noncoding transcripts. Of the 27 transcripts containing ORFs but no annotation, 18 were enriched in root tips and 9 in the mature root; and out of the 54 non-ORF transcripts, 25 were enriched in root tips and 29 in mature root tissue.</p><p>Of the 1,728 DETs in the root tips, 82 transcripts were without any predicted ORF and considered noncoding. Interestingly, 41 transcripts were up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. For 15 transcripts upregulated in root tips transdecoder predicted single putative functional ORF and for another six transcripts were predicted with more than one ORF. In the down-regulated transcripts, 11 transcripts were predicted with a single ORF, and three transcripts were predicted with more than one ORF.</p><p>We annotated the DETs by BLASTx against the protein databases and mapped them onto the metabolic pathways using MapMan.

A total of 248 DETs were represented on the overview pathway map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205582.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Of the 248 mapped transcripts, 51 were involved in the secondary metabolism, 43 in lipid metabolism, 38 in cell wall metabolism, 23 in amino acid metabolism, 20 in starch and sucrose metabolism, 20 in minor carbohydrate metabolism, 13 in glycolysis and TCA cycle and 15 in the mitochondrial electron transport pathway.</p><fig id="pone.0205582.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0205582.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>An overview of the differentially expressed transcripts mapped onto the metabolic pathways.</title><p>The differentially expressed genes were mapped onto the metabolic pathways using MAPMAN software.

In agreement with this, a significant number of up-regulated transcripts in the root tips were involved in the protein synthesis. These transcripts encode the ribosomal subunit proteins (93 transcripts), translation (52 transcripts), chromatin structural proteins like histone proteins (39 transcripts), RNA binding and splicing components (27 transcripts), transcription factors (25 transcripts), and transport (21 transcripts) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205582.s007">S4 Table</xref>). Several metabolic pathways were up-regulated in root tips: TCA cycle and mitochondrial electron transport pathways, FA synthesis, terpene synthesis, and biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp. In contrast, mature root mainly functions in cell elongation, differentiation, the formation of root hairs and lateral roots and transportation of water and minerals. Accordingly, nine genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway for lignin biosynthesis were enriched in the mature root tissue in agreement with its function in water conduction. These include those encoding a phenyl ammonia lyase (PAL), a 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA ligase (4CL), a hydroxycinnamoyl-Coenzyme A shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), a Caffeate O-methyltransferase (COMT) and four 4CL-like proteins. Except for the <italic>COMT</italic>, expression of these genes was induced in mature root tissues. Closely related to phenylpropanoid pathway, expression of the flavonoid pathway genes was also increased in the mature root. Pathways for FA degradation and biosynthesis of polar uncharged amino acids, Ser, Gly, and Cys, were also up-regulated in root tips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205582.s007">S4 Table</xref>).</p><p>Of the metabolites, carbohydrate metabolism regulates root development in numerous ways apart from providing energy and structural components, including gravitropism, osmotic adjustment, and sugars that often act as regulatory signals and are required for lateral root initiation. We found that 22 transcripts corresponding to the different enzymes in the starch and sucrose metabolism were differentially expressed in root tips and mature root tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205582.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Transcripts (TC039764, TC088166, and TC088167) encoding for the AGPases, starch synthases and starch branching enzymes in the starch biosynthesis pathway were induced or up-regulated in the root tips. At the same time, transcripts encoding enzymes of starch degradation, such as starch D enzyme, starch phosphorylase, and heteroglycan glucosidase were induced in the root tips, indicating active starch metabolism in the root tip tissue. In another aspect, three transcripts (TC001776, TC071737, and TC110592) encoding sucrose synthase were induced in the mature root.</p><p>Phytohormones, particularly auxin, brassinosteroids (BRs), jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA), regulate almost every aspect of root development and growth. Numerous transcripts encoding hormone biosynthetic enzymes and transporters were also differentially transcribed between root tips and the mature root portion. Five auxin-promoting transcripts, one encoding the auxin efflux carrier PINFORMED 2 (PIN2), similar to OsPIN2 of rice and AtPIN7 of Arabidopsis, and four coding for an auxin-inducible 5NG4/Nodulin21-like protein (TC144456) and O-fucosyltransferases, were up-regulated in the root tip compared to the mature root. In contrast, six auxin-suppressing transcripts, three encoding Aux/IAA proteins homologous to OsIAA2, OsIAA6, and OsIAA21 of rice, and three coding for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthase-like proteins, which prevent free IAA accumulation, were up-regulated in the mature root. Downstream in the auxin pathway, two transcripts, TC056398 and TC018213, encoding SMALL AUXIN UPREGULATED (SAUR) proteins were differentially expressed with the former induced in the root tip and the latter induced in the mature root. Three transcripts encoding ATP binding cassette subfamily B/multi-drug-resistance/P-glycoprotein (ABCB/MDR/PGP) were up-regulated in the root tips. These proteins were identified to create the auxin gradient together with other auxin influx carriers [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the BR biosynthesis pathway, three transcripts, two for cycloartenol synthases and one for the DWF1 protein, which is involved in the conversion of early brassinosteroid precursor 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], were up-regulated in the root tips. These results suggest that a higher auxin and BR level is maintained in root tips compared to the matured zone. In the JA signaling pathway, three transcripts encoding the sulfotransferases similar to AtST2A, a protein involved in the reduction of the endogenous levels of 12-OH-JA (a by-product of switching off JA signaling) [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], were up-regulated in the mature root, suggesting an opposite pattern for JA as compared to auxin and BRs. A complicated scenario was observed for the ABA biosynthetic pathway. Three transcripts homologous to Arabidopsis ABA DEFICIENT 2 (ABA2)/SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE 1 (SDR1) and one homologous to aldehyde oxidase 2 (AAO2), a putative ABA aldehyde oxidase that may be functional in the last step of ABA biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], were induced in the mature root. Two transcripts coding for TETRATRICOPEPTIDE-REPEAT THIOREDOXIN-LIKE 1 (TTL1) were up-regulated in root tips. TTL1 in Arabidopsis is required for elongation and organization of the root meristem and is involved in ABA signaling [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Two transcripts encoding for cytokinin receptor HISTIDINE KINASE 3 were induced in the mature root.</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of gene expression. Expression of 112 transcripts encoding TFs of 21 families was altered in wheat root along the longitudinal axis. The major classes include AP2, bHLH, bZIP, MYB and MYB-related, homeodomain (HD), NAC families, and numbers and expresstion patterns of these TF transcripts are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205582.g009">Fig 9</xref>. Notably, all 38 members of nine TF families, including three members of the GRAS family and 28 members of the NF-YB family, were induced in the root tips. By contrast, all 21 members of five TF families, including 12 members of the NAC family, four members of the HD family, were only induced in the mature root tissue. For the remaining seven TF families, such as the MYB family, 28 members were up-regulated, and 25 members were down-regulated in root tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205582.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Several differentially expressed TFs are homologous to the known genes functioning in root development in the model plants, including two members of the STY-LRP1 family upregulated in the mature root tissue, suggesting their involvement in lateral root development. Of the four members of the AP2 family that up-regulated in root tips, three are homologous to AINTEGUMENTA-like 5 of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>taushcii</italic> (AIL5; EMT02119) and another homologous to BABY BOOM 2 (BBM2; EMS64473) of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>urartu</italic>. Two transcripts encoding for the ARFs homologous to AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 Arabidopsis thaliana (AtARF6) were up-regulated in root tip, and another transcript encoding for ARF homologous to AtARF11 was induced in mature root part. One transcript (TC084552) encoding the Argonaute family member homologous to AtAGO4 that is associated with 24-nt smallRNA and involved in RNA dependent DNA methylation [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was induced in root tips.</p><fig id="pone.0205582.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0205582.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes in root tips and mature root involved in the starch biosynthesis.</title><p>The transcripts encoding for the enzymes involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism were represented each by a box.

Transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology promises new opportunities for studying root development. RNA-Seq technology has been used to characterize the response of wheat root transcriptome to phosphate starvation [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and infection of <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> var. <italic>tritici</italic>, a pathogen of take-all root rot disease [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], but a reference transcriptome of wheat root and developmental expression pattern are not available. The present study developed and characterized a <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of wheat root transcriptome containing 94,106 transcripts that contain unique ORFs and identified 1,728 differentially expressed transcripts between the root tip and mature root tissues. All this will provide a global view of wheat root transcriptome and start point for a molecular understanding of root development and improving soil-related stress tolerance in a reverse genetics approach.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Root transcriptome assemblies</title><p>We assembled the FLX reads into a transcriptome of 19,123 Newbler contigs with &#x0003e;50% completeness and the HiSeq reads into a transcriptome of 146,165 transcripts with &#x0003e;90% completeness. For the FLX reads, the Newbler assemblies performed better overall on the statistics metrics than TGICL and Mira. Compared to the recently reported transcriptome assemblies of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], barley [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], <italic>Persea Americana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and smooth cordgrass [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], our Newbler assembly showed comparable or even better statistic metrics including N50 value and percentage of assembled reads. Compared to the Newbler assembly of the pyrosequencing reads, the assembly of the HiSeq reads had a much greater N50 value, assembly size, and completeness mainly due to the large read number. A total of 1,749 transcripts from the HiSeq assembly found matches in the wheat genome sequences but did not get hits in the publicly available RNA-Seq reads from the wheat roots. This discrepancy is mainly due to the enrichment of them in root tips by separation of root tips from the rest of the root in the present study. All these corroborate sound quality and high content of information of the HiSeq assembly of the wheat root transcriptome.</p><p>Common wheat is a hexaploid species with A, B, and D genomes and a total of 94,000 to 120,000 protein-coding genes [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0205582.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of the 91,543 transcripts, 34,506 were separated into 115,692 homoeologous blocks. If each of these 34,506 transcripts was derived from merging of at least two homoeologous transcripts, the total number of transcripts in the root assembly would be &#x0003e;126,049, excessing the total gene number, implying the existence of isoforms of transcripts due to alternative splicing, which is enhanced in polyploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In another aspect, 6.8% protein-coding transcripts did not find a match in the current assembly of the wheat genome, indicating the incompleteness of wheat genome assembly. In these respects, the wheat root transcriptome assemblies from this research can be used for improving wheat genome assembly and annotation.</p><p>Of the 146,165 transcripts in the final assembly of the HiSeq reads, 91,543 transcripts contain predicted functional ORFs, 26,971 transcriptes were transcribed from pseudogenes, and 13,181 transcripts have no coding capacity and do not show homology to degenerated TEs, suggesting that they were transcribed as polyadenylated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (<xref rid="pone.0205582.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The high percentage of pseudogenic transcripts in the wheat root transcriptome is consistent with the discovery that of the 7,264 predicted protein-coding genes on wheat chromosome 3B, 1,938 (26.7%) are pseudogenes or gene fragments [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and 1,060 (54.7%) of them are transcriptionally active [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. While the function of pseudogenes in plant remains poorly characterized, LncRNAs condition gene expression in plants by regulating histone modification, transcription machinery, RNA processing machinery and posttranscriptional [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The 13,181 lncRNA transcripts, particularly the 55 lncRNA transcripts differentially expressed between root tip and mature root, are an important resource for studying lncRNA regulation of root development.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Gene expression and root development</title><p>Although root has a much simpler anatomical structure as compared to the shoot and flower, it grows in a very different environment, underground, implying the existence of root-specific expression patterns including a set of root-specific genes. We found that 6.8% of the protein-coding genes are specifically expressed in root, not in the aboveground portion of wheat plants. Further characterization of these root-specific genes using reverse genetics approaches will shed new light on root development.</p><p>Current assembly of wheat root transcriptome contains 91,543 HC protein-coding transcripts and 16,074 non-ORF transcripts, but only a small fraction of the transcriptome, 1.17%, was differentially expressed in the root tip and mature root tissues, similar to the result obtained in rice [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In rice, 1,761 of the 2,067 DETs showed higher transcription level in the mature root tissue [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Opposite to the finding in rice, 1,083 of 1,728 wheat DETs were up-regulated or induced in the root tips.</p><p>Root tip and mature root tissues differ in several functional aspects, and these differences are reflected at the transcriptome level. First of all, root tips contain apical meristem for maintaining cell division capacity. Consistent with this, several TFs for maintaining meristem indeterminacy, such as GRAS TFs homologous to AtHAM2 and AtHAM3 of Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and AP2 TFs homologous to AIL5 [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and BABY BOOM [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], were up-regulated in root tips. Besides, numerous genes related auxin transport and response are up-regulated in root tips and auxin catabolic, and auxin signal suppressor genes were down-regulated in root tips. BR is critical in the regulation of cell expansion [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and increased expression of three BR biosynthetic genes in root tips was probably due to the partial inclusion of elongation zone in the root tip samples. Another important function of root tips is to percept gravitropism, which is achieved through starch statoliths [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In agreement with this function, transcription of 19 starch metabolic genes was up-regulated in root tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205582.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In another aspect, the matured root part mainly functions in transporting water and minerals, which is achieved by development of lateral roots, root hairs, and vascular system. For lateral root development, four lateral root-promoting TF genes including two LRP1 [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], a KUODA1 [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and an AtNAC1 homolog, were up-regulated in the mature zone, and an AtMBY93 of Arabidopsis, a negative regulator of lateral root [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], was down-regulated in the mature zone. Increased expression of sucrose synthase in the mature zone may also be related to lateral root development as seen in soybean [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Another difference in the mature zone from root tips lies in the differentiation of vascular bundles. In this respect, nine lignin biosynthetic genes and a homolog of <italic>SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 2</italic>, encoding a NAC TF activating the lignin biosynthetic genes [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], were up-regulated in the mature root portion.</p><p>Development of the root transcriptome assembly and identification of the DETs lay a foundation for molecular studies of wheat root biology and for improving soil-borne stress tolerance. In this respect, the recent development of sequence-cataloged TILLING libraries [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] will be very helpful in validating the function of DETs and homologs of root regulators identified in the model plant Arabidopsis and rice. Genome editing technologies also can be used for targeting the candidate genes in wheat for functional validation [<xref rid="pone.0205582.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we assembled a wheat root transcriptome containing 92,335 protein-coding and 16,074 non-ORF transcripts, 6.8% and 5.2% of which, respectively, are root specific. Approximate 6.8% of coding transcripts and ~2.2% of non-ORF transcripts were not found in the current wheat genome assembly. We also identified 1,728 transcripts differentially transcribed in root tip and mature root tissues. Annotation of these DETs provides a blueprint of molecular regulation of wheat root development. Thus, they are important candidates for in-depth analysis of wheat root development by TILLING, genome editing or other reverse genetics approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) classification of the de novo assembled 454 contigs.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Alignment statistics of the de novo assembled root transcriptome against the genomic and the predicted cDNA sequences from the hexaploid wheat draft genome.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) classification of the Root transcripts with predicted ORFs.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) classification of the contigs from de novo assembled 454 reads.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Gene Ontology (GO) classification of the transcripts from illumina assembly.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s006"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Transcription factor (TF) families expressed in both the root tissues used in this study.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0205582.s007"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Annotation and the expression profiles of the DETs.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0205582.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Zhengzhi Zhang for technical assistance.
