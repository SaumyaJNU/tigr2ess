Analysis of flour from the mutant line by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the omega-5 gliadins and several gamma gliadins encoded by the closely linked <italic>Gli-B1</italic> locus were also missing as a result of a deletion of at least 5.8&#x000a0;Mb of chromosome 1B. Two-dimensional immunoblot analysis of flour proteins using sera from WDEIA patients showed reduced IgE reactivity in the mutant relative to the parental lines due to the absence of the major omega-5 gliadins. However, two minor proteins showed strong reactivity to patient sera in both the parental and the mutant lines and also reacted with a monoclonal antibody against omega-5 gliadin.

At the same time, some of these proteins are responsible for human health problems, including food allergies and celiac disease. Among the gluten proteins, the omega gliadins are particularly immunogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These proteins comprise 5&#x02013;10% of total flour protein, depending on the cultivar and the growth conditions of the plant. Omega gliadins consist almost entirely of repetitive sequences with unusually high proportions of glutamine and proline (~&#x02009;68&#x02013;73%) and generally lack cysteine. The proteins are divided into two groups, referred to as omega-5 and omega-1,2 gliadins, that differ in N-terminal sequences and repetitive motifs. Omega-5 gliadins usually begin with SRL and contain multiple copies of FPQQQ and QQIPQQ while omega-1,2 gliadins begin with ARE, ARQ or KEL and contain the repetitive motif PQQPFP. Omega-5 gliadins are encoded at the <italic>Gli-1</italic> locus on the short arm of chromosome 1B in hexaploid wheat and are the major sensitizing allergens in the serious food allergy wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) that occurs in sensitized individuals when the ingestion of wheat is followed by physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Omega-1,2 gliadins are encoded on chromosomes 1A and 1D and contain immunodominant T-cell stimulatory epitopes involved in celiac disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Omega gliadins show some of the largest changes among gluten proteins in response to the application of fertilizer or high temperatures during grain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], likely influencing the immunogenic potential of the flour.</p><p id="Par8">Despite their importance, detailed studies of the omega gliadins have been challenging. Omega-5 gliadins, in particular, are difficult to identify by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) because they contain a limited number of proteolytic cleavage sites. More importantly, there is a lack of complete protein sequences for omega-5 gliadins in databases despite the considerable allelic diversity in these proteins among cultivars. In fact, until recently, only one of more than 100 omega gliadin protein sequences in NCBI, BAE20328, had a predicted molecular weight within the 48.9&#x02013;51.5&#x000a0;kDa range determined for omega-5 gliadins by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Four proteins, AJG03093, AJG03080, AJG03079 and CAR82267, are likely missing portions of their repetitive regions and have predicted molecular weights ranging from 36 to 42&#x000a0;kDa, while many other omega-5 gliadin proteins in NCBI are missing sizeable portions of their central repetitive regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The lack of full-length protein sequences is most likely due to difficulties in cloning their highly repetitive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, genomic sequences of regions that harbor prolamin genes from the reference wheat Chinese Spring were assembled and annotated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and two additional full-length omega-5 gliadin protein sequences were added to NCBI, omega-B3 (AWK59777) and omega-B6 (AWK59773), corresponding to proteins of 47.7 and 51.5&#x000a0;kDa, respectively.</p><p id="Par9">Arrays of overlapping peptides based on the full-length sequence of BAE20328 were used to identify IgE binding epitopes for WDEIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The peptides QQFPQQQ, QQIPQQQ, QQSPQQQ and QQSPEQQ were found to be dominant epitopes with amino acids in positions one, four, five, six and seven critical for IgE binding. Interestingly, there are 23 copies of QQFPQQQ and 4 copies of QQIPQQQ in BAE20328, some of which are overlapping, that contribute to the immunogenicity of the protein.</p><p id="Par10">In recent years, a number of strategies have been explored to reduce the levels of the omega-5 gliadins in wheat flour with the goal of reducing the immunogenic potential of the flour. One approach involves selecting genotypes with reduced levels of these proteins. Towards this end, Denery-Papini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] surveyed flour proteins from a collection of cultivars expressing 13 different omega-5 gliadin alleles for reactivity with IgE from WDEIA patients. Only one cultivar containing a wheat/rye translocation showed low levels of reactivity. However, these translocation lines had poor breadmaking properties due to the replacement of the omega-5 gliadins with the secalins from rye. Another group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] identified a spontaneous mutation in a line from a cross between a spelt cultivar and a Polish breeding line that resulted in an inactive omega-5 gliadin gene at the <italic>Gli-B1</italic> locus. After crossing this line to another line containing inactive genes at the <italic>Gli-A1</italic> and <italic>Gli-D1</italic> loci, they reported a ~&#x02009;30% reduction in immunoreactivity using ELISA. Biotechnology approaches using RNA interference have also been used to reduce the levels of omega-5 gliadins, resulting in transgenic wheat plants with reduced IgE reactivity to sera from WDEIA patients without adverse effects on flour end-use functional properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Recently, the wheat mutant DH20, missing LMW-GS encoded by the B genome, was identified by screening glutenins from a double haploid population derived from a cross between two Korean wheat cultivars, the hard white wheat Keumkang and the soft red wheat Olgeuru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. When evaluated in the field over 2 years, DH20 demonstrated good agronomic properties as well as a slightly higher yield than the parental cultivars. In addition, the protein content, SDS sedimentation volume and mixing tolerance of DH20 flour were similar to Keumkang, a leading Korean bread wheat cultivar with good milling quality and medium dough strength. In this paper, we compare the total protein composition of DH20 flour to that of the parental lines and report that DH20 is also missing the major omega-5 gliadins, resulting in a wheat with reduced immunogenic potential. However, the analysis revealed that several minor but highly immunogenic omega-5 gliadins remained in this line. The work highlights some of the challenges faced in using breeding approaches to reduce the immunogenic potential of wheat flour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>2-DE analysis of total flour proteins</title><p id="Par12">Analyses of total flour proteins from the parental lines Keumkang and Olgeuru and the mutant line DH20 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) revealed that a number of gluten proteins between ~&#x02009;34 and 55&#x000a0;kDa are missing in the mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

It is well known that the LMW-GS genes are tightly linked to gamma and omega gliadin genes on the short arms of the group 1 homoeologous chromosomes in hexaploid wheat. A relatively new group of gluten proteins, the delta gliadins, are also encoded in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recent efforts in genome sequencing revealed the structural organization of these groups of genes in the reference wheat Chinese Spring and identified the sequences of 4 LMW-GS, 4 gamma gliadins, 2 delta gliadins and 3 omega gliadins located on a 5.3&#x000a0;Mb region of the 1A chromosome, 4 LMW-GS, 6 gamma gliadins, 1 delta gliadin and 8 omega gliadins located on a 6.5&#x000a0;Mb region of the 1B chromosome, and 7 LMW-GS, 4 gamma gliadins, 2 delta gliadins and 7 omega gliadins located on a 5.6&#x000a0;Mb region of the 1D chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Amplification of genomic DNA from the parental lines and the mutant line DH20 with primers for omega-5 gliadin and allele-specific LMW-GS genes confirmed that these genes from the 1B chromosome are missing in DH20. The use of repeat junction primers that amplify sequences near the ends of the 6.5&#x000a0;Mb region of the 1B chromosome further indicated that at least a 5.8&#x000a0;Mb region of the 1B chromosome was deleted in the mutant line. This region of the chromosome also contains multiple resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

These proteins correspond to minor spots in 2-D gels that were found to react with a monoclonal antibody specific for omega-5 gliadins, suggesting that they are omega-5 gliadins encoded outside the deleted region of chromosome 1B.</p><p id="Par25">It has been generally accepted that omega-5 gliadins are encoded by genes at the <italic>Gli-B1</italic> locus on the short arm of the 1B chromosome. Indeed, primers specific for the known full-length omega-5 gliadin genes amplified DNA from Chinese Spring but not from the N1BT1A or N1BT1D nullisomic tetrasomic lines. However, over the years there also have been a number of reports of omega gliadins encoded by minor loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent genome sequence analyses in the reference wheat Chinese Spring has made it possible to survey the entire collection of gliadin and LMW-GS genes in a hexaploid wheat cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This work uncovered four omega-5 gliadin genes on the D genome in addition to the eight on the B genome. All of the D genome genes were classified as pseudogenes because of frameshift mutations in the coding regions and low FPKM values in transcriptome data. However, one gene, omega-D4, contained only a single mutation near the 3&#x02032; end of the coding region that, if expressed, would yield a truncated protein with an altered C-terminus. It is interesting that there are a number of sequences for omega-5 gliadin genes in NCBI that encode proteins with altered C-termini. Most were from a study in which 66 omega-5 gliadins were amplified from cDNA prepared from developing grain from a variety of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. All were missing portions of the central repetitive regions and thus would encode proteins of only 4 to 38&#x000a0;kDa.

It is also interesting that 23 of 29 sequences amplified from hexaploid wheat and 14 of 17 sequences amplified from tetraploid wheat encoded proteins with the N-terminal sequence SRL while all 20 of the sequences amplified from diploid wheat encoded proteins with the N-terminal sequence TRQ that is also found in omega-D4. Additionally, a gene with only 4&#x000a0;bp mismatch to omega-D4 was identified in <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic>, the D progenitor of hexaploid wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Omega-5 gliadins are unusual in that each protein contains many copies of IgE-reactive epitopes. Omega-D4 contains a greater number of the major WDEIA epitopes than the other full-length omega-5 gliadins deposited in the NCBI database. Additionally, there is considerable overlap among these epitopes in many regions of the protein. The fact that these proteins are very minor species in both the parental lines and DH20, yet the proteins are nearly as IgE reactive with patient sera as the more abundant omega-5 gliadins suggests that both the number and the arrangement of the epitopes in the protein are likely important in determining its immunoreactivity.</p><p id="Par27">In previous studies, RNA interference was used to reduce the levels of omega-5 gliadins in wheat flour, resulting in transgenic plants with reduced IgE reactivity to sera from WDEIA patients without adverse effects on flour end-use functional properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This homology-based approach used a 153&#x000a0;bp target region corresponding to the 3&#x02032; end of the coding region and effectively eliminated all omega-5 gliadins from the flour with relatively few other changes on the proteome. However, the resulting plants were transgenic and not likely to be incorporated into breeding programs because of consumer acceptance issues. The present work demonstrates that breeding approaches also can be used to reduce the levels of omega-5 gliadins and hence the immunogenic potential of the flour. However, such approaches are complicated by the genetic linkage of omega gliadin, gamma gliadin and LMW-GS genes and the finding that minor but highly immunoreactive omega-5 gliadins may be encoded on chromosomes other than 1B.</p><p id="Par28">Currently, the exact sequences of omega-5 gliadins in the parental lines Keumkang and Olgeuru and the mutant line DH20 are not known. It is also not known whether other hexaploid wheat cultivars contain active omega-5 gliadin genes on either their A or D chromosomes. However, it is clear that future efforts to reduce the levels of omega-5 gliadins and other immunogenic proteins in wheat flour, either by breeding approaches that rely on induced mutations or biotechnology approaches that utilize homology-based methods such as gene silencing or genome editing, would benefit from a detailed understanding of the complete complement of gluten protein genes in individual cultivars. Clearly, it is important to know the numbers of genes and pseudogenes in these complex families as well as their precise sequences and genomic locations. To this end, the reference genome sequence from Chinese Spring now makes it possible to design gene capture methods to select genomic regions containing gluten protein genes from individual cultivars for long-read sequencing. Thus, it should be possible to obtain the complete sequences of highly repetitive omega-5 gliadin genes that have not been easily cloned in the past and survey the entire collection of these genes in different cultivars of hexaploid wheat. Such studies will also provide insight into the evolution of this interesting family of gluten protein genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">Breeding or biotechnology approaches to reduce the immunogenic potential of wheat flour require that multiple gluten proteins be eliminated without impacting the functional properties of the flour.

In this study, a mutant wheat line missing the major omega-5 gliadins encoded on chromosome 1B was shown to have reduced IgE reactivity with sera from WDEIA patients. However, several minor but highly immunogenic proteins remained in the flour. Further analysis revealed that these proteins were omega-5 gliadins encoded by genes located on chromosome 1D that had not been described previously and that the proteins contained a greater number of WDEIA epitopes and more overlapping epitopes than those encoded on chromosome 1B. The work illustrates the importance of detailed knowledge about the complete sets of gluten protein genes and proteins in individual wheat cultivars for future efforts aimed at reducing the immunogenic potential of wheat flour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par30"><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. cv.
