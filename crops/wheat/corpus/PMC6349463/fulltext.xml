The structure of the cytoplasmic-open state is known, but it has proved difficult to understand the transport mechanism in the absence of a structure in the matrix-open state. Here, we describe the structure of the matrix-open state locked by bongkrekic acid bound in the ADP/ATP-binding site at the bottom of the central cavity. The cytoplasmic side of the carrier is closed by conserved hydrophobic residues, and a salt bridge network, braced by tyrosines. Glycine and small amino acid residues allow close-packing of helices on the matrix side. Uniquely, the carrier switches between states by rotation of its three domains about a fulcrum provided by the substrate-binding site. Because these features are highly conserved, this mechanism is likely to apply to the whole mitochondrial carrier family.</p></sec><sec><title>Video Abstract</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc3"><media xlink:href="mmc3.mp4"/></supplementary-material></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Structure of the matrix-open state of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier solved</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">The inhibitor bongkrekic acid locks the state by occupying the substrate-binding site</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Conformational changes during transport are highly dynamic, using six mobile elements</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Roles of all conserved sequence features in mitochondrial carriers are now explained</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>The structure of the matrix-open state of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier reveals its transport mechanism, which involves rotation of six structural elements around a central substrate-binding site.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>adenine nucleotide translocator</kwd><kwd>adenine nucleotide translocase</kwd><kwd>bongkrekate</kwd><kwd>cardiolipin</kwd><kwd>induced fit</kwd><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>alternating access mechanism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: December 27, 2018</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Solute transport across the impermeable mitochondrial inner membrane is essential for the function and survival of eukaryotic cells.

The archetypal member of the family, the ADP/ATP carrier, performs the vital role of transporting ADP into the mitochondrial matrix and ATP out of the mitochondrion to maintain high cytosolic ATP concentrations for energy-requiring reactions (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kunji et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Every day, this carrier transports our own body weight in ADP and ATP, recycling each ATP molecule more than a thousand times. The carrier cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state), which can be trapped by the membrane-impermeable toxic inhibitor carboxyatractyloside (CATR) (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Vignais et&#x000a0;al., 1973</xref>), and the matrix-open state (m-state), which is locked by the membrane-permeable bongkrekic acid (BKA) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Erdelt et&#x000a0;al., 1972</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Henderson and Lardy, 1970</xref>).

The first atomic structure of the CATR-inhibited bovine ADP/ATP carrier (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pebay-Peyroula et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) was followed by those of yeast ADP/ATP carriers in the same state (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ruprecht et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Each sequence repeat forms a domain, comprising an odd-numbered transmembrane helix (H1, H3, or H5), a loop containing a short matrix helix lying parallel to the membrane (h12, h34, or h56), and an even-numbered transmembrane helix (H2, H4, or H6) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pebay-Peyroula et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). In the C-terminal region of each odd-numbered transmembrane helix, a conserved signature motif Px[DE]xx[KR] is found (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pebay-Peyroula et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The proline residues of this motif are located at pronounced kinks in the odd-numbered helices, giving them an L-shape. Consequently, these helices come together on the matrix side, where the charged residues of the three motifs form the matrix salt bridge network, closing the central cavity to the mitochondrial matrix in the c-state (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Pebay-Peyroula et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Nucleotides are among the largest solutes to cross biological membranes, yet mitochondrial carrier proteins are relatively small. Transport must therefore involve profound conformational changes, which nevertheless must prevent proton leak across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Until now, the molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial carriers transport has not been established. However, some sequence features required for a transport mechanism have been identified. First, a consensus substrate-binding site has been proposed in the central cavity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dehez et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kunji, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Tajkhorshid, 2008</xref>).

K302 on H6, which was mutated to stabilize the m-state (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">King et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), interacts weakly with D101 on H2.

Close to the salt bridge residues, a highly conserved set of tyrosine residues, positioned a turn of helix away from the positively charged residues of the network, unexpectedly act as braces for the salt bridges, providing extra inter-domain interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). Y204 forms a hydrogen bond with D299, bracing the K208-D299 salt bridge. Y298 forms a hydrogen bond with D101, compensating for the weak D101-K302 interaction. We call these extra interactions tyrosine braces. ADP/ATP carriers are unusual in the mitochondrial carrier family in having a positively charged residue substituting for tyrosine on H2 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). Here, R100 forms electrostatic interactions with both D101 (intra-domain) and D205, bracing the K104/D205 salt bridge in an equivalent way to the tyrosine braces. These tyrosine braces, which are part of the highly conserved [YF][DE]xx[KR] motif, serve a similar function to the glutamine braces observed for the matrix salt bridge network (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ruprecht et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

The structure reveals that there are few inter-domain interactions other than those of the cytoplasmic salt-bridge network and brace residues, which is an important functional feature of this highly dynamic protein. Therefore, the relative network strength correlates well with the overall stability of the protein. Here, we extend our analysis to include the tyrosine brace interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). In the BKA-inhibited state, mutation of R100 and Y204 significantly reduces the thermal stability compared to the wild-type protein, consistent with these residues forming a brace that stabilizes the m-state.

This computational analysis shows that maximum transport occurs when the interaction energies of the cytoplasmic network, matrix network, and substrate binding are approximately equal. As a consequence, the analysis predicted that interactions in addition to the cytoplasmic salt bridge network should stabilize the matrix state. The current structure reveals that the tyrosine braces provide these additional interactions, resulting in the cytoplasmic and matrix networks having similar numbers of polar interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). The effect of mutations of the cytoplasmic salt bridge network and braces on the transport rate was investigated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>E). Mutations of residues involved in electrostatic interactions (R100, K104, and K208) had the greatest effect on the transport rate, followed by Y204. Mutations of Q302 and Y298 had only&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;mild effect.

Thus, the domains do not move as single rigid bodies and are more dynamic than originally anticipated (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ruprecht et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In the m-state, the even-numbered helices kink at R88 (H2), G192 (H4), and R287 (H6), which are key amino acids predicted to be involved in substrate-binding, called the contact points of the substrate-binding site (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kunji and Robinson, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kunji, 2006</xref>). The inward movement of these helical regions (comprising the even-numbered helices from the contact point to the C-terminal end), which we call the gate elements, contributes to bringing the residues of the cytoplasmic network together. Conformational change from the c- to m-state must involve rigid-body rotations of the core elements to open the central cavity to the mitochondrial matrix and inward movements of the gate elements, closing the central cavity to the intermembrane space.<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Conformational Changes between M- and C-States and the Structural Consequences of Inhibitor Binding</p><p>(A) Structure of domain 1 in the m-state (blue cartoon) versus the c-state (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4C9H" id="intref0170">4C9H</ext-link>, outline).</p><p>(B and C) Similar views of (B) domain 2 (m-state yellow cartoon, c-state outline) and (C) domain 3 (m-state red cartoon, c-state outline), respectively.

The inhibited states have therefore been called abortive states, which are not transport cycle intermediates. Comparing the structures binding either inhibitor allows us to investigate the structural consequences of inhibition.</p><p id="p0115">We initially analyzed the domain structures. For the CATR-inhibited carriers, while most of the domain structure is conserved, there are noticeable deviations in the positions of the C-terminal end of H2 and N-terminal end of H3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D). The structures of the individual domains in the BKA-inhibited state superpose well, indicating that the inhibitor has not perturbed the structures of the domains themselves (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>E).</p><p id="p0120">To understand the consequences of CATR binding further, we have taken the core and gate elements from the BKA-inhibited structure and superposed them on the CATR-inhibited structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F). Core elements 1 and 3 (from domains 1 and 3) align very well, with root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.97 and 1.16&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for backbone atoms, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>A and 6C). However, core element 2 does not align well, with an RMSD of 2.25&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for backbone atoms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). Fitting core element 2 with outlier rejection revealed that while most of the structure fits well, there is a deviation at the N-terminal end of H3, due to change in the kink angle at the Pro of the signature motif (from 76&#x000b0; in the CATR-inhibited state to 43.0&#x000b0; in the BKA-inhibited state). When aligning the gate elements, H4 and H6 aligned well (backbone RMSDs of 0.95 and 0.85&#x000a0;&#x000c5;, respectively), but H2 did not (backbone RMSD of 1.76&#x000a0;&#x000c5;). Closer inspection found that this misalignment is due to the helix of the BKA-inhibited&#x000a0;structure being straight, whereas that of the CATR-inhibited&#x000a0;structure is kinked at Phe107 in CATR-inhibited ScAac2 (Phe99 in TtAac). This kink is caused by Lys108 interacting with the two sulfate groups of CATR, pulling H2 down and bringing the C-terminal end close to the end of H3, which is consequently displaced as well (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>G). The deviations in the positions of H2 and H3 observed here are consistent with those seen when comparing the CATR-inhibited domains alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D). Therefore, the action of CATR is 2-fold&#x02014;first, it acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding to the substrate-binding site, and second, it induces a structural change in H2 and H3 that locks the carrier in an abortive state.</p><p id="p0125">A noticeable difference between the BKA- and CATR-inhibited states is that the CATR-inhibited state is highly symmetrical, in agreement with the presence of three homologous sequence repeats, whereas the BKA-inhibited state is 3-fold pseudosymmetric at the cytoplasmic side but somewhat asymmetrical at the matrix side. To investigate the cause, we symmetrized the BKA-inhibited structure, while treating the domains as rigid bodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>H), in agreement with our analysis of the domain structures (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>E). Comparing the two structures, the positions of domains 2 and 3 are similar, but domain 1 is displaced toward the matrix side. In agreement, the cardiolipin-binding site between domains 2 and 3 is maintained in the BKA-inhibited structure, with good electron density present for the lipid (cdl 802), but the sites between domains 1 and 3 and domains 1 and 2 are disrupted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>). To exclude the unlikely possibility that the domain displacement is a consequence of crystal packing interactions or the nanobody interacting with H1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), we solved the structure of the BKA-inhibited carrier from a crystal grown without the nanobody, which diffracted anisotropically to 3.6&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>, TtAac crystal). Although the crystal diffracts to lower resolution than the TtAac-Nb crystal, it confirms that the structure of BKA-inhibited TtAac is not significantly affected by nanobody binding (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). The displacement of domain 1 is therefore likely to be due to inhibitor binding, leading to an abortive m-state. Closer inspection shows two likely molecular reasons for the abortive state. First, E37 in the symmetrized carrier lies in close proximity to negatively charged groups of BKA, so electrostatic repulsion may drive domain displacement. Second, the molecular volume of the inhibitor (443&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>) is substantially greater than ATP (354&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>), hence steric repulsion may also play a role (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>I).<fig id="figs7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;S7</label><caption><p>Comparison of BKA-Inhibited M-State Structures from Crystals Grown with and without Nanobody, Related to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref></p><p>(A) Superposition of m-state carrier structures from crystals grown with nanobody (<italic>P</italic>3<sub>2</sub>21 space group, gray tube) and without nanobody (<italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group, tube with domain 1, blue; domain 2, yellow; domain 3, red), viewed from the membrane.

Both inhibitors occupy the positions where the substrates bind by mimicking the biophysical properties rather than the exact chemistry of the substrates and by forming multiple interactions that prevent the substrate competing for binding. Carboxylate groups of the inhibitors mimic the phosphate groups of the natural substrates. Furthermore, the binding itself distorts the structure of this highly dynamic protein, locking it in an abortive state that cannot undergo the required conformational changes for transport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0135">The available structures have revealed the conformational changes undergone by the domains. Further insight requires considering these domain changes in the context of the whole protein. A morph between the CATR- and BKA-inhibited states does not provide a plausible mechanism, because of the absence of an occluded state and because of clefts appearing in the lipid-facing part of the carrier. Having gained insight into the nature of inhibitor-induced distortions, we can use models of the uninhibited proteins to propose a plausible transport mechanism. Because CATR and BKA bind to different states of the protein, we generated a model of the uninhibited c-state from the superposition of the core and gate elements of the BKA-inhibited structure with the CATR-inhibited structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F). The uninhibited m-state model is the symmetrized model from the BKA-inhibited structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>H). This seems a more reasonable approach than modeling the uninhibited m-state from elements of the CATR-inhibited&#x000a0;structure, due to the CATR-induced kink in H2 and displacement of H3.</p><p id="p0140">Superposition of the uninhibited c- and m-states allows us to propose how the domain motions affect the overall conformation of the carrier, leading to opening and closing of the substrate-binding site to either side of the membrane. The core elements have a rocking motion of &#x0223c;15&#x000b0;, which is essential for opening and closing of the matrix side of the carrier (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). The gate elements rotate toward or away from the central pseudosymmetry axis, respectively closing or opening access to the substrate-binding site from the intermembrane space (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A), with the contact points of the binding site acting as pivots (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kunji and Robinson, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Kunji, 2006</xref>). The conformational changes are small around the substrate-binding site but become progressively larger toward either side of the membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B), indicating that the substrate-binding site acts as a fulcrum. Because the same substrate-binding site is accessible from both c- and m-states, and ADP and ATP are chemically related, the same process can apply in either direction across the membrane, explaining the known equimolar exchange activity. Atoms move predominantly parallel to the membrane, with no significant movement perpendicular, consistent with the transmembrane helices moving within the plane of the lipid bilayer. We speculate that engagement of the contact point residues with the substrate, leading to tighter interactions, drives the inward movement of the gate elements and formation of the cytoplasmic network. Concurrently, the cytoplasmic sides of the core elements also move inward, causing the core elements to rock and to open the matrix side. The involvement of all three contact points in substrate-binding makes it likely that the movements of the core and gate elements are symmetrical and simultaneous in all three domains, which also prevents clashes or gaps appearing in the protein structure. These movements lead to a coupled closing of the cytoplasmic side and an opening of the matrix side in the transition from c- to m-states, consistent with an alternating-access transport mechanism (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>C&#x02013;7G). The fungal ADP/ATP carriers have an extra turn of &#x003b1;-helix on the matrix end of H1, which is a loop in the bovine carrier. This extra turn slides out of the translocation pathway when the carrier transitions from the c- to the m-state, allowing sufficient access to the binding site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>G).<fig id="fig7"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Proposed Transport Mechanism of the Mitochondrial ADP/ATP Carrier</p><p>(A) Conformational changes between models of the uninhibited c- and m-states viewed laterally from the membrane, with helices shown as cylinders.

Access of substrate to the m-state binding site is likely to be facilitated by thermal energy driving rotamer changes, changing the size of the entry. However, the size difference between the cavities in the two states might reflect the biophysical requirements for transport of negatively charged nucleotides in the presence of a membrane potential. Import of ADP, which has three negative charges, is opposed by the membrane potential. Therefore, the carrier has a large water-filled cavity in the c-state to shield the substrate from the influence of the membrane potential until it is bound to residues of the substrate binding site. The negatively charged phosphate groups are neutralized by interactions with the three positively charged residues of the binding site (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kunji and Robinson, 2006</xref>), facilitating ADP import. The export of ATP, which has four negative charges, is stimulated by the membrane potential, which is maximal when shielding by water is minimal, explaining the relatively small cavity in the matrix state. Once ATP is bound to the central substrate binding site, a net negative charge remains, which helps to drive export.</p><p id="p0150">A morph between the uninhibited c- and m-states (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>) demonstrates these proposals and passes through an occluded state, in which the substrate-binding site is inaccessible from either side of the membrane, which is essential for maintenance of the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The structure of the BKA-inhibited carrier provides the first insight into the structure of the m-state. It shows that the ADP/ATP carrier functions as a monomer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bamber et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kunji and Crichton, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kunji and Harding, 2003</xref>), because the conformational changes alter the overall molecular shape profoundly, precluding stable interactions between carriers. The carrier has a single substrate-binding site that is alternately accessible from either side of the membrane, in agreement with inhibitor (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Klingenberg, 1979</xref>) and sequence analysis (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The structure demonstrates the formation of the cytoplasmic salt bridge network in the m-state, showing that formation and disruption of the cytoplasmic and matrix salt bridge networks are key features of the transport cycle (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">King et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ruprecht et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). It has also explained all of the conserved sequence features of mitochondrial carriers, including the role of bulky hydrophobic residues in forming the cytoplasmic gate and the role of the GxxxG and &#x003c0;xxx&#x003c0; motifs in the dynamic conformational changes of the inter-helical interfaces during the transport cycle. Because these sequence features are conserved, it is likely that the proposed mechanism holds for all mitochondrial carriers, which constitute the largest solute carrier family in humans. The mechanism is unique among transport proteins, as it involves coupled rotations of three domains, with each domain undergoing two separate rotations, leading to alternating access from opposite sides of the membrane to the substrate-binding site. Together with the CATR-inhibited structures, this structure provides a framework for further biophysical and structural analysis of the intermediary states of the transport cycle, which will elucidate how substrates drive the conformational changes and how pathological mutations affect transport activity.</p><p id="p0155"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video S1.

Iterative cycles of model building in Coot (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Emsley et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) and refinement in Buster (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bricogne et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) were carried out. B-factor sharpened maps were used to help confirm side-chain positions. Refinement with Buster used LSSR restraints and grouped B-factors (2 per residue, for main chain and side chain). In the early stages of model building and refinement, LSSR restraints were from the nanobody homology model, and a carrier homology model based upon PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4C9H" id="intref0125">4C9H</ext-link> chain A. In later stages, LSSR restraints were based on models of the TtAac-Nb complex that had been refined with phenix.refine (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Afonine et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) using secondary structure restraints. B-factor refinement included TLS parameterization (1 TLS group per chain). Diffraction data were collected from a crystal diffracting to higher resolution (statistics in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), also untwinned, and model building and refinement were continued using these data, maintaining the flagged reflections from the earlier dataset for calculating R<sub>free</sub>. BKA was modeled into positive <italic>m</italic>Fo-<italic>D</italic>Fc difference electron density present in the central cavity. Several factors were considered during the modeling of BKA: (1) the stereochemistry of the ligand, combined with minimal geometrical distortions following refinement, (2) minimal clashes with protein residues, (3) maximal number of protein-ligand interactions, (4) maximal cross-correlation with the 2<italic>m</italic>Fo-<italic>D</italic>Fc density map. Refinement statistics are shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>. The final model consists of residues 11-252 and 257-306 of TtAac, residues 1 to 124 of the nanobody, a molecule of BKA and of PEG, and partially modeled cardiolipins in the asymmetric unit. The cardiolipin between domains 2 and 3 has good density. However, density for cardiolipins between domains 1 and 2 and domains 1 and 3 is of poorer quality, due to the BKA-induced displacement of domain 1 making it impossible for cardiolipins to bridge the distance between the even-numbered transmembrane and matrix helices. Both these cardiolipins have been modeled as partial lipids at both positions. It is likely that these cardiolipins interact predominantly with either the even-numbered transmembrane or matrix helix, stochastically throughout the crystal. Residues M250-S252 and K257 of the carrier lie in very weak electron density in this crystal, but their position is supported by good density in the earlier crystal.</p><p id="p0220">Phases for the TtAac structure (without nanobody) were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), searching with carrier domains from the TtAac-Nb model (domain 1: residues 13-107, domain 2: residues 116-211, and domain 3: 220-306; TFZ&#x000a0;= 17.2, LLG&#x000a0;= 378). Rigid-body refinement was carried out in Buster (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bricogne et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), with each domain defined as a rigid-body, reaching R&#x000a0;= 36.2%, R<sub>free</sub>&#x000a0;= 37.1%. The resulting electron density maps showed density for features not included in the model (loop regions, BKA and cardiolipin phosphates, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). The carrier structure superposes very well with that solved from the TtAac-Nb crystals (RMSD of 0.6&#x000a0;&#x000c5; over 1096 matched atoms). Splitting domain 1 into smaller rigid sub-domains, or performing jelly-body refinement in REFMAC, did not change the structure.</p><p id="p0225">Comparisons of the TtAac BKA-inhibited m-state structure with the ScAac2 CATR-inhibited c-state shown in the figures used PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4C9H" id="intref0130">4C9H</ext-link> chain A.

The polder OMIT map (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Liebschner et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) for BKA was calculated after perturbing the TtAac-Nb model by removing the BKA coordinates and subjecting the model to coordinate and group B-factor refinement in phenix.refine. The coordinates of BKA were added back prior to polder map calculation, to define the region for bulk solvent exclusion while being excluded from map calculation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4.8"><title>Models of the uninhibited c- and m-states</title><p id="p0230">The model of the uninhibited c-state of TtAac was generated by superposing the core and gate elements from the BKA-inhibited TtAac structure onto the structure of CATR-inhibited ScAac2p (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4C9H" id="intref0140">4C9H</ext-link> chain A) in PyMOL. Superposition of the backbones of core domains 1 and 3, and of even-numbered helices 4 and 6 could be accomplished without outlier rejection. Superposition of the backbones of core domain 2 and even-numbered helix 2 required outlier rejection and refinement, as implemented in the align command. As discussed in the manuscript, these differences are attributable to CATR-induced protein distortions. The superposed elements of the TtAac crystal structure provided an initial model for the uninhibited c-state, which was completed by loop building based upon the available crystal structures.
