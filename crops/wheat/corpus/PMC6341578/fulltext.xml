Here, we elucidate the therapeutic efficacy and immune-mediated mechanisms of a novel HER2-targeting ADC bearing a potent anthracycline derivate as payload (T-PNU) in a human HER2-expressing syngeneic breast cancer model resistant to trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Mechanistically, the anthracycline component of the novel ADC induced immunogenic cell death leading to exposure and secretion of danger-associated molecular signals. RNA sequencing derived immunogenomic signatures and TCR&#x003b2; clonotype analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a prominent role of the adaptive immune system in the regulation of T-PNU mediated anti-cancer activity. Depletion of CD8 T cells severely reduced T-PNU efficacy, thus confirming the role of cytotoxic T cells as drivers of the T-PNU mediated anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, T-PNU therapy promoted immunological memory formation in tumor-bearing animals protecting those from tumor rechallenge. Finally, the combination of T-PNU and checkpoint inhibition, such as &#x003b1;-PD1, significantly enhanced tumor eradication following the treatment. In summary, a novel PNU-armed, HER2-targeting ADC elicited long-lasting immune protection in a murine orthotopic breast cancer model resistant to other HER2-directed therapies. Our findings delineate the therapeutic potential of this novel ADC payload and support its clinical development for breast cancer patients and potentially other HER2 expressing malignancies.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40425-018-0464-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibody-drug conjugates</kwd><kwd>HER2-positive breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Anthracycline</kwd><kwd>Checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>SystemsX TTF2014/270 </institution></funding-source><award-id>TTF2014/270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zippelius</surname><given-names>Alfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006069</institution-id><institution>Krebsliga Beider Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is amplified and overexpressed in about 20% of all breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To date, three HER2-specific agents have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of breast cancer: trastuzumab, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against the extracellular subdomain IV and II of HER2, respectively, which exert their therapeutic effect through inhibition of HER2 signaling and receptor dimerization as well as conferring effector function through their Fc domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. T-DM1 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combining trastuzumab-mediated target (HER2)-specificity with the chemotherapeutic potency of the microtubulin polymerization inhibitor maytansinoid DM1 as payload, thus allowing for targeted drug delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. T-DM1 showed improved survival compared to trastuzumab and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, despite improved outcomes in many patients, tumors can develop various and complex resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This urges expansion of the therapeutic arsenal by development of drugs that are more potent and/or target novel pathways. In the ADC field, efforts are currently under way to develop site-specific conjugation technologies, novel compounds with increased cytotoxicity, and combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Here we tested a recently developed, novel HER2-targeting ADC composed of trastuzumab conjugated to a derivate of the highly potent anthracycline PNU-159682 through a non-cleavable peptide linker by sortase-mediated antibody conjugation (SMAC) technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], hereafter called T-PNU. The SMAC technology allows for homogenous and stable ADC preparations with defined and favorable drug-to-antibody ratios and high in vitro and in vivo potency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">PNU-159682 (3&#x02032;-deamino-3&#x02033;,4&#x02032;-anhydro-[2&#x02033;(<italic>S</italic>)-methoxy-3&#x02033;(<italic>R</italic>)-oxy-4&#x02033;-morpholinyl]) is a metabolite of nemorubicin (MMDX), and was found to be 700- to 2400-fold more potent than its parent drug in cultured human tumor cells. Importantly, ADCs based on PNU-159682 showed enhanced efficacy in in vivo tumor models compared to ADCs based on conventional payloads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Anthracyclines have been used in anticancer therapy for more than 40&#x02009;years. Doxorubicin became the most widely used anthracycline due to its low toxicity and potent anti-tumor activity against solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite generic immunomodulatory effects, evidence supports a role for anthracyclines in boosting a specific anti-tumor immune response by triggering a programmed, immunogenic variant of apoptosis known as immunogenic cell death (ICD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The immunostimulatory activity of anthracyclines has been linked to their capacity to kill cancer cells upon activation of a multi-pronged adaptive stress response involving autophagy, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and type I interferon signalling. The ER stress response underlies the exposure of the ER chaperone calreticulin (CRT), HSP70 and HSP90 as well as the release of ATP and reactive oxygen release (ROS). Altogether, these signals released from dying cancer cells are known as damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and are commonly used as ICD markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Our group has extensively characterized the immunostimulatory properties of certain ADC payloads such as maytansinoid, ansamitocin P3 and dolastatins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Accordingly, we have recently shown that the ADC T-DM1 actively stimulates tumor-specific immune responses in breast cancer patients and HER2-expressing breast cancer models through DM1-mediated maturation of dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Here, we dissect the immune response of the novel ADC T-PNU in a syngeneic, murine breast cancer model overexpressing human HER2 and nonresponsive to both trastuzumab and T-DM1 treatments. We identified the immune-related properties of T-PNU, resulting in the stimulation of CD8 T cell immunity and protective immunological memory formation. Finally, T-PNU treatment was accompanied by an increased survival of most tumor-bearing animals when combined with checkpoint inhibitor therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and tumor models</title><p id="Par7">Balb/c animals were bred in the animal facility of the Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerland.

In this regard Rios-Doria J et al. recently reported that two different pyrrolobenzodiazepine and tubulysin-based ADCs affect tumor growth through ICD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] leading to potent anti-tumor effects due to the stimulation of the immune system.</p><p id="Par43">The clinical successes of immunotherapeutic strategies, such as checkpoint blockers, has shifted the general focus from simple drug-tumor cell interactions towards the more complex drug-tumor-immune cell interactions. However, investigation of the interplay between cancer and immune cell poses a considerable challenge owing to the evolving and heterogeneous nature of these two multicellular systems. There is a need to further dissect these complex interactions to identify predictive biomarkers, develop novel drugs, and provide mechanistic insights to support clinical decision making. We therefore performed a comprehensive characterization of the &#x0201c;Cancer Immunome&#x0201d; on the gene, gene set, gene set network, cell type and TCR&#x003b2; clonotype level by next-generation mRNA sequencing. This allowed us to identify the major immunological contributors to T-PNU&#x02019;s anti-tumor efficacy. T-PNU treatment-responding samples consistently clustered apart from non- or low-responsive untreated control, trastuzumab- and T-DM1-treated samples when assessed for overall gene expression, immune signatures, immune pathways and TCR clonality. In particular, an immune phenotype gene panel displaying upregulated genes of the adaptive arm of the immune system indicated a critical role of T cells in the T-PNU response. Gene set and pathway analysis revealed a particular T cell and inflammatory response in the high-responding T-PNU samples. These results suggest that targeted T-PNU therapy elicits profound changes in the tumor environment that allows homing and activation of T cells resulting in a strong cytotoxic anti-tumor response resulting in the induction of a long-lasting and potent anti-tumor immunity. The significance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the establishment and maintenance of anti-tumor immunity was conclusively demonstrated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion in tumor re-challenge experiments which completely abrogated the anti-tumor immunity induced by T-PNU treatment. The involvement of CD8+ T cells and the formation of a tumor cell type specific immunological memory in tumor re-challenge experiments differs from immune-checkpoint inhibitor blockade, which generally activates a T cell response and which can lead to systemic auto-immune related side effects that may require discontinuation of treatment. The tumor-type specific anti-tumor immunity holds the promise that such unwanted side effects cause by a systemic and general activation of T cell responses by Immune checkpoint inhibitors may not occur upon translation into clinical applications.</p><p id="Par44">Antibodies targeting the PD1-PDL1 axis have substantial clinical activity in different tumors and mediate durable tumour remissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Yet, only a minority of patients benefit from PD-(L)1 blockade, likely those whose tumors are pre-infiltrated by T cells. Here, our data strongly support a T cell dependence and the efficacy of the combination with PD1 blocking antibodies is achieved through non-redundant but complementary mechanisms: T-PNU augments T cell infiltration into the tumor by inducing tumor-specific, adaptive anti-tumor immunity, whereas PD1 blockade reinvigorates exhausted T cells. Similar therapeutic benefit has been observed with other chemotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Importantly, using suboptimal yet therapeutically active doses of T-PNU, our data further suggest that checkpoint inhibitors are capable to boost the anti-tumor activity of ADCs while these sub-curative doses may lead to a better tolerability of ADCs. Most notably, it can be expected that the synergistic effects of T-PNU ADCs with immune-checkpoint inhibitors may lead to a reduction of the dosing regimen of both therapeutics modalities below the effective doses of each of the drugs when used in mono-therapy. This can be expected to lead to a reduction of dose-limiting toxicities of the individual treatments.</p><p id="Par45">In conclusion, this report describes the mechanism of anti-tumor immunity and long-lasting tumor protection of the novel T-PNU ADC composed of the backbone antibody trastuzumab site-specifically conjugated to a derivate of the highly potent anthracycline PNU-159682 by a non-cleavable peptide linker. Strikingly, in a breast cancer model unresponsive to trastuzumab and T-DM1, T-PNU is capable of overcoming the resistance by inducing a strong anti-tumor potency in vitro and efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, the immunostimulatory properties of T-PNU profoundly reshape the transcriptional and immunogenomic profile within the tumor micro-environment leading to the development of a long-lasting anti-tumor immunity and immune protection from subsequent tumor challenge. Finally, enhanced anti-cancer activity through combination with &#x003b1;-PD1 treatment hints to a promising strategy to render tumors sensitive to checkpoint blockade therapy by treatment with ADCs carrying an anthracycline payload.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
