    "<label>Aim</label>The purpose of this study was to know the genetic and biochemical identification of isolated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from Balinese bovine (Bos sondaicus) intestinal waste, acidity, and ox bile salts and to inhibit the growth pathogen of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and the potential of those isolated to improve nutrient value of wheat pollard as animal feed ingredient by fermentation process.<label>Materials and Methods</label>This research was divided into three stages. The first stage, isolated LAB were obtained from the bovine intestines at a slaughterhouse in Indonesia. Small intestinal samples were collected from 10 healthy Balinese beef cattle (B. sondaicus). The isolated LAB were identified by VITEK 2, polymerase chain reaction, and 16S rDNA. The basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) was performed to determine the phylogenetic tree. The second stage, the LAB were screened for their tolerance at pH 2, 3, and 4; bile salt, and antagonistic to enteric pathogen. In the third stage, to determine the potency of this isolate to increase nutrient content of wheat pollard by facultative anaerobe fermentation for 3 and 5 days.<label>Results</label>The result of the first stage showed that the isolate could be identified as Lactobacilluscasei WPL 315. The result of the second stage showed that the isolate tolerance to low pH (pH 2, pH 3, and pH4) for 90 min and 24 h, and this isolate had viability tolerance in 0.3% bile salt. The isolate can inhibit S. aureus and E. coli. The result of the third stage by proximate analysis showed that crude protein increased by 23.08% after fermentation, while crude fiber decreased by 61.24% on the level 0.5% L. casei subsp. WPL 315 in the 3-day fermentation.<label>Conclusion</label>Based on the results, it showed that L. casei WPL 315 derived from indigenous intestinal Balinese beef cattle (B. sondaicus) has tolerant characteristic on acidity and ox bile salts, has antagonistic effect against E. coli and S. aureus, and has the ability to increase crude protein and decrease crude fiber content of wheat pollard. It would be interesting to determine whether the strain has a probiotic candidate."
