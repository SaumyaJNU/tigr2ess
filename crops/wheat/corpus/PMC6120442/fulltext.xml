This is because image time series with both high spatial and temporal resolution contain a number of irregular time series, which cannot be identified by most existing classifiers. In this study, we firstly proposed an improved artificial immune network (IAIN), and tried to identify major crops in Hengshui, China at early season using IAIN classifier and short image time series. A time series of 15-day composited images was generated from 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Near-infrared (NIR) band and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were selected as optimal bands by pair-wise Jeffries&#x02013;Matusita distances and Gini importance scores calculated from the random forest algorithm. When using IAIN to identify irregular time series, overall accuracy of winter wheat and summer crops were 99% and 98.55%, respectively. We then used the IAIN classifier and NIR and NDVI time series to identify major crops in the study region. Results showed that winter wheat could be identified 20 days before harvest, as both the producer&#x02019;s accuracy (PA) and user&#x02019;s accuracy (UA) values were higher than 95% when an April 1&#x02013;May 15 time series was used. The PA and UA of cotton and spring maize were higher than 95% with image time series longer than April 1&#x02013;August 15. As spring maize and cotton mature in late August and September&#x02013;October, respectively, these two crops can be accurately mapped 4&#x02013;6 weeks before harvest. In addition, summer maize could be accurately identified after August 15, more than one month before harvest. This study shows the potential of IAIN classifier for dealing with irregular time series and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series at early-season crop type mapping, which is useful for crop management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Classification</kwd><kwd>Cotton</kwd><kwd>Maize</kwd><kwd>Early-season</kwd><kwd>Wheat</kwd><kwd>Hengshui</kwd><kwd>Sentinel</kwd><kwd>Image time series</kwd><kwd>Improved artificial immune network</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>The China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project under Grant</funding-source><award-id>BX201700286</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>The National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No</funding-source><award-id>NSFC-61661136006</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-3"><funding-source>China Ministry of Agriculture &#x0201c;Introduction of International Advanced Agricultural Science and Technology Program (948 Program)&#x0201d; project No</funding-source><award-id>2016-X38</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project under Grant BX201700286, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. NSFC-61661136006) and the China Ministry of Agriculture &#x0201c;Introduction of International Advanced Agricultural Science and Technology Program (948 Program)&#x0201d; project (No. 2016-X38).

As cropland distribution maps are the basement of the crop growth monitoring work and also important inputs of the crop production models, there is an urgent need of accurate in-season cropland mapping, particularly for major staple food crops such as wheat and maize (<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Satellite observations have demonstrated good potential for identifying crop types. Multi-temporal data are most commonly used for crop type classification, since image time series can describe the phenological differences among different crops (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Atzberger, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). However, there remain drawbacks to this technique. Generally, early-season crop type maps are important inputs for regional and global crop monitoring systems (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Waldner et al., 2015</xref>). Most existing studies use image time series of the entire growing season to generate crop type maps; however, such maps are often acquired too late to inform crop management (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Whitcraft, Becker-Reshef &#x00026; Justice, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, to identify crop types in the early season, there is a need of high temporal frequency image time series. Most high temporal frequency data are provided at coarse spatial resolution, such as EOS-MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR data, which can observe the land surface once daily (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Van Leeuwen, Huete &#x00026; Laing, 1999</xref>). Conversely, data with better spatial resolution has a lower temporal frequency, such as the most commonly used Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data, which provides 30 m resolution images at a 16-day temporal frequency (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">NASA, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">USGS, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Furthermore, the remote sensing data from moderate resolution optical satellites (such as Landsat) are further limited by missed observations due to cloud obscuring the Earth&#x02019;s surface (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Marshall, Dowdeswell &#x00026; Rees, 1994</xref>). Therefore, moderate spatial resolution image time series are always irregular, which is a problem for early season crop type mapping. Although some gap-filling methods and high spatial and temporal resolution image fusion methods have been proposed to generate 30 m image time series with good temporal frequency (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, Liu &#x00026; Chen, 2012</xref>), the methods are generally time consuming and the results always have some uncertainty for crop type classification. In addition, these methods need to use images covering the entire growing season as input, which limits their ability for early season crop type mapping.</p><p>An alternative method is the image composition strategy, which uses the median value of all available pixels during one month as a composited value for each month. This method makes full use of the available observations and is simple to interpret. However, there is a contradiction between the period of composition and the information contained in the composited image time series. Long composition periods (e.g., 6 months) are less informative and cannot support crop type identification, while short composition periods (e.g., 15&#x02013;30 days) lead to &#x0201c;missing value&#x0201d; pixels in the image time series (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Van Leeuwen, Huete &#x00026; Laing, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe, Roy &#x00026; Vermote, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). Although various classifiers have been proposed for image classification, such as classification tree-based classifiers and machine learning classifiers, those methods have difficulty dealing with irregular image time series with missing values (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Breiman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Howard &#x00026; Wylie, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Mountrakis, Im &#x00026; Ogole, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Waheed et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, classifiers that can handle irregular time series are important for early season crop type mapping based on short period compositions of image time series (15&#x02013;30 days or even shorter).</p><p>In addition, most existing crop type classification results were derived using image time series with coarse or moderate resolution, such as those of MODIS and Landsat. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolution results in many mixed pixels (pixels containing several crop types) in images of small fields (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Lobell &#x00026; Asner, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Muchoney et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, the pixels at the crop field boundary may become mixtures of crops fields, roads and other land cover types. Thus, the mixed pixels cause spectrum variation and misclassification (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hao, Wang &#x00026; Niu, 2015b</xref>). Several works have conducted crop type mapping using very high-resolution image time series, such as Gaofen-1, RapidEye and Quickbird images (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hao, Wang &#x00026; Niu, 2015b</xref>; <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Turker &#x00026; Ozdarici, 2011</xref>). However, the regions studied were generally small (&#x0003c;20 &#x000d7; 20 km), and the data are not freely available worldwide. As the Sentinel mission provides both C-Band SAR (Sentinel-1) data and optical (Sentinel-2) data at high spatial resolution (10 m) and high revisit frequency (6 days for Sentinel-1 and 5 days for Sentinel-2), it is worth investigating the potential of early season crop type mapping using Sentinel image time series (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Drusch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">ESA, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Van Der Meer, Van Der Werff &#x00026; Van Ruitenbeek, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tried to identify crop types in the early season from 10 m resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The objectives were (1) to propose a method which can deal with missing values in satellite remote sensing data for crop type mapping and (2) to evaluate how early in the growing season accurate crop type maps can be generated.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Area and Data Sets</title><p>Hebei Province is located in the North China Plain and it is one of Chinese main cropping provinces.

The study region has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate that is characterized by hot, rainy summers and cold, dry winters. The main land cover/use types within this area are cropland, grassland, residential land, industrial land and water areas. The study area is representative of regions that rotate crops of winter-wheat and summer maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). The major crop types in the study region are winter wheat, summer maize, spring maize and cotton. Winter wheat is harvested in June, while spring maize and cotton are mature in late August and September&#x02013;October, respectively. Summer maize is sown after the harvest of winter wheat and is harvested in late September to early October. The croplands are mostly arranged in long, narrow fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>), which have a high potential for producing mixed pixels on Landsat images. In addition, shortages of water further affect crop production (<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Xie, Cheng &#x00026; Lv, 2017</xref>). Therefore, early season crop type maps are urgently needed to improve crop growth monitoring and harvest management. Sentinel image may provide an opportunity to solve these problems.</p><fig id="fig-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.5431/fig-1</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study area.</title><p>The blue dots in this figure represent the in situ surveyed fields.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-06-5431-g001"/></fig><fig id="fig-2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.5431/fig-2</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>High-resolution images of the crop fields in the study area.</title><p>(A) Sub-region 1, (B) Sub-region 2, (C) Sub-region 3, (D) Sub-region 4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-06-5431-g002"/></fig><p>The remote sensing data used in this study were Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data obtained from April 1 to October 31, 2017. Sentinel-1A provides C-band images at a 6-day revisit frequency. The Level 1 ground range detected (GRD) product in the interferometric wide swath model was used in this study. The images have dual-polarization vertical transmission/vertical receiving (VV) and vertical transmission/horizontal receiving (VH) bands. The images have high geometric accuracy and were provided as backscatter coefficient in decibels. Sentinel-2 data were provided at 10 m spatial resolution with a 5-day revisit frequency; such data has shown potential to identify crop types (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Belgiu &#x00026; Csillik, 2018</xref>). There were 96 scenes of Sentinel-1 images and 254 scenes of Sentinel-2 images utilized in this study. All of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were processed using JavaScript application programming interfaces on the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), which provides a fast and large-area computational service (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Google, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Gorelick et al., 2017</xref>). The spatial resolution of Sentinel-1A images were 10 m on the GEE, and the data is available in GEE as the &#x0201c;COPERNICUS/S1_GRD&#x0201d; image collection. A 15-day composition was used to process the Sentinel-1 data, and the maximum value among each 15-day composition period was used to represent the Sentinel-1 signal of the 15-day period. Of the 14 composited images, all were used in this study except for the July 1&#x02013;15 image, because it was not fully covered by effective observations (<xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sentinel-2 data were Level 1C top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data (image collection COPERNICUS/S2 on GEE). Cloud-cover pixels were selected and removed using the automatic phenology-based synthesis classification algorithm (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Simonetti et al., 2015</xref>), and 15-day composition image time series were then generated on GEE, with the middle value of each composition period used in the composition. As the spatial resolution of the blue band (Band 2), green band (Band 3), red band (Band 4) and near-infrared (NIR) band (Band 8) were 10 m, we only included these four bands. Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each composition period was calculated using the corresponding TOA reflectance (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Rouse et al., 1974</xref>). Among the 14 composited images generated, four had cloud cover that was greater than 50% and were therefore discarded.

We did not consider the solar zenith angle, observation angle and bidirectional reflectance distribution function, as the number of available observations was limited (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Huete et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Wardlow, Egbert &#x00026; Kastens, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Ground reference data were collected during a field survey of Hengshui in August 2017. The surveyed fields were selected to include the major crop types across the study areas. A total of 373 fields were surveyed in-situ, and the crop types and geographic coordinates of the surveyed fields were recorded. Afterward, the boundaries of the surveyed crop fields were digitized as polygons using ArcGIS. For each crop type, the polygons were equally divided as training polygons and validation polygons. Next, the polygons were converted to Sentinel-2 pixels and boundary pixels were removed to ensure that all samples contained pure pixels. Finally, 17,542 training samples (pixels) and 25,124 validation samples (pixels) were acquired. The classifier was trained using the training samples and the classification results were validated using the validation samples. This study used all validation samples to verify the classification accuracy because the pixel-based classifier was employed in this study.

First, 15-day compositions of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were generated. As winter wheat was harvested in June and cotton, spring maize and summer maize were harvested in September, we used images from April to May for early-season winter wheat identification and images from April to August for early-season cotton, spring maize and summer maize identification. We firstly used Jeffries&#x02013;Matusita (JM) distance and the Gini importance score from the random forest (RF) algorithm to evaluate the crop separability and contribution of each feature on crop classification, and generated image time series of the optimal bands. Then, we proposed an improved artificial immune network (IAIN) which could deal with the missing values in the image time series. Finally, we varied time series length, used IAIN to identify crop types and evaluated the effect of time series length on crop classification accuracies. Based on these results, we determined how early the accurate distribution maps of winter wheat, cotton, spring maize and summer maize can be acquired.</p><fig id="fig-3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.5431/fig-3</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Flowchart illustrating the process of this study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-06-5431-g003"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Feature importance estimation</title><p>We used both Gini importance scores from the RF algorithm and JM distances to select the optimal features for early-season crop type classification (<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Breiman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Bruzzone, Roli &#x00026; Serpico, 1995</xref>). The JM distance ranges from 0 to 2, and larger JM distance indicates higher level of separability between the two classes. We selected JM distance in this study to estimate pair-wise crop separability for each feature because previous studies proved that JM distance have high potential to measure crop separability (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Medjahed et al., 2016</xref>), and the JM distance was implemented in Matlab 2012B in this study. In addition, Gini index generated from RF was used to measure the importance of the features when considering all crops. The RF model combines multiple classification trees, and when training the RF model, each tree is constructed using two-thirds of the training records, the remaining records are used for a test classification with an error referred to the &#x0201c;out-of-bag error&#x0201d;. There are two free parameters of RF; the number of trees (ntree) and the number of features to split the nodes (mtry) were defined as 1,000 and the square root of the total number of input features in this study. During the training procedure of RF, every time a split of a node is made on a variable, the Gini impurity criterion for the descendent nodes is less than that of the parent node. The importance score is the sum of the Gini decreases for each individual variable over all trees in the classification forest. The Gini importance score were implemented using the Randomforest package in R (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Breiman et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the optimal features for identifying crop types in Hengshui were selected by considering both RF Gini index and JM distance.</p></sec><sec><title>The improved artificial immune networks classifier</title><p>In this study, we IAIN algorithms for crop type identification. The IAIN methods are inspired by the human immune system and have shown high potential to solve pattern recognition problems (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Gong, Im &#x00026; Mountrakis, 2011</xref>). There are two procedures in IAIN: <italic>training</italic> and <italic>classification</italic>. The training procedure is to use training samples as &#x0201c;antigens,&#x0201d; then generate &#x0201c;antibodies&#x0201d; from the &#x0201c;antigens.&#x0201d; The classification procedure uses &#x0201c;antibodies&#x0201d; to classify images by identifying new crop &#x0201c;antigens.&#x0201d; Normally, &#x0201c;antibodies&#x0201d; contain three attributes: the crop type label of the antibody, the center vector, and recognition radius. An antibody can identify the antigens within its recognizing radius. &#x0201c;Antigens&#x0201d; contain two attributes: the crop type label and center vector.</p><p>After normalizing all features to a range of 0&#x02013;1, the normal training procedures involve five steps: pre-selection, cloning, mutation, adaptive calculation of new antibodies and antibody reorganization (<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Zhong &#x00026; Zhang, 2012</xref>). Pre-selection (Step 1) requires selection of an antigen which best represents the unrecognized antigens; Step 2 (cloning) is to clone a large number pre-selected antigens; Step 3 (mutation) is to mutate the cloned antigens randomly and generate &#x0201c;possible antibodies.&#x0201d; Afterward, the most complex step (Step 5, adaptively calculating new artificial antibodies) uses all &#x0201c;possible antibodies&#x0201d; to identify all the unrecognized antigens. The antibody that can identify the most antigens is then defined as a new antibody. Antigens that can be recognized by the new antibody are labeled as recognized antigens, and the other antigens remain as unrecognized antigens for generating the next antibody. Finally, when all antigens have been identified by the antibodies, the training procedure concludes. During the training procedure, a similarity measurement is used to estimate the distance between the antibody/antigen center vectors. This study used the Euclidean distance for this purpose as it is easily calculated (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Lhermitte et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To deal with image time series containing missing values, we IAIN classifier in the classification procedure by adaptively selecting classification features from &#x0201c;antibodies&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). For example, if the &#x0201c;antibodies&#x0201d; have <italic>n</italic> features but feature &#x0201c;F4&#x0201d; of pixel <italic>x</italic> is missing, the IAIN first detects the indexes of the available features of pixel <italic>x</italic>, then generates &#x0201c;sub-antibodies&#x0201d; only containing the available features of pixel <italic>x</italic>. Then the Euclidean distances between pixel <italic>x</italic> and the center vectors of all &#x0201c;sub-antibodies&#x0201d; are calculated. Finally, the pixels are labeled according to the crop type label of the antibody with the lowest distance.</p><fig id="fig-4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.5431/fig-4</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Classification procedure of the improved artificial immune networks (IAIN) algorithm.</title><p>Note: This figure shows the condition that the feature F4 is left out.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="peerj-06-5431-g004"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Early-season crop identification evaluation</title><p>To evaluate the earliest time phase that we could accurately identify the major crops in the study region, we set the April 16&#x02013;30th as the start point, and extended the time series length by 15-day. The April 16&#x02013;30th was set as the start point of this study because the Sentinel-2 data of April 1&#x02013;15th composition contain too few cloud-free pixels. Next, we acquired several image series with different lengths, and then used the IAIN to classify these image time series. The classification accuracies were then assessed using the validation samples, and the influence of time series length on crop identification accuracies were evaluated based on these classification accuracies. Commonly, the classification accuracies increase with the time series length, and then become saturated. We compared the time phases that classification accuracies saturated and the harvest time of each crop, and finally deduced how long we could generate crop type distribution maps before the harvests.</p></sec><sec><title>Non-vegetation masks</title><p>Although the time series signals of different crops have unique characteristics, there can be some noise caused by miscellaneous factors such as residential regions.

Meanwhile, most existing classifiers, such as maximum likelihood classification, support vector machine and RF, cannot deal with missing values, if the input data contain &#x0201c;NaN&#x0201d; value, the these classifiers will return &#x0201c;not classified&#x0201d; as output. In this study, we proposed IAIN classifier to deal with the &#x0201c;missing value&#x0201d; problem.</p><p>To assess the potential of the IAIN of dealing with &#x0201c;missing value&#x0201d; pixels, we firstly used April&#x02013;June and April&#x02013;August image time series to identify winter wheat and summer crops, and used validation samples with &#x0201c;missing value&#x0201d; to verify the classification accuracies.
