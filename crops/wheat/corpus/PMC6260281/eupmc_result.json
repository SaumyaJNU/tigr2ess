    "This data article reports the chemical compositions (protein, fat, fiber, ash, lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid) and fermentation quality, represented by V-value determined from the proportion of ammonia nitrogen in total nitrogen and volatile fatty acid contents, in silages prepared from low-market-value vegetables (carrot roots, cabbage leaves, and radish leaves). Potato protein concentrate, a byproduct of starch production from potato tuber, was used to supplement the protein contents in the silages. The first type of silage was produced by fermentation of a mixture of wheat bran and either carrot, cabbage, or radish without supplemental potato protein. The second type of silage was produced by fermentation of a mixture of wheat bran and either carrot, cabbage, or radish with supplemental potato protein. The third type of silage was produced by mixing the first silage type with unfermented potato protein. Chemical compositions and fermentation quality of the three silage types are provided in table formats."
