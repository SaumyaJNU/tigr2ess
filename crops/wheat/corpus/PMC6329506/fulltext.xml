However, there is currently a knowledge gap in our ability to assess the extent and intensity of the utilization of land by livestock, which is the single largest land use in the world. We developed a spatial model that combines fine-scale livestock numbers with their associated energy requirements to distribute livestock grazing demand onto a map of energy supply, with the aim of estimating where and to what degree pasture is being utilized. We applied our model to Kazakhstan, which contains large grassland areas that historically have been used for extensive livestock production but for which the current extent, and thus the potential for increasing livestock production, is unknown. We measured the grazing demand of Kazakh livestock in 2015 at 286 Petajoules, which was 25% of the estimated maximum sustainable energy supply that is available to livestock for grazing. The model resulted in a grazed area of 1.22 million km<sup>2</sup>, or 48% of the area theoretically available for grazing in Kazakhstan, with most utilized land grazed at low intensities (average off-take rate was 13% of total biomass energy production). Under a conservative scenario, our estimations showed a production potential of 0.13 million tons of beef additional to 2015 production (31% increase), and much more with utilization of distant pastures. This model is an important step forward in evaluating pasture use and available land resources, and can be adapted at any spatial scale for any region in the world.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Leibniz-Gemeinschaft (DE)</institution></funding-source><award-id>SAW-2012-IAMO-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funded by Leibniz-Gemeinschaft to DM.

Animal products make up 40% of the current global food demand [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which is expected to double by 2050 (from 2005 levels) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The largest increases in the demand for livestock products are expected to occur in developing and transitioning countries [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Livestock production already accounts for around 75% of all agricultural land use, including land that is classified as pasture and cropland that is dedicated to feed production [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The livestock sector is also responsible for up to 18% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, due in large part to methane emission during enteric fermentation in ruminants, as well as emissions of nitrous oxide from nitrogen-based fertilizers, methane from manure management, and carbon related to land use change [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Grazing patterns of livestock also play a huge role in native species abundance and distribution [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Yet, despite the large land requirement and significant environmental footprint of livestock production, knowledge gaps exist when it comes to the area, intensity, and spatial distribution of land that is devoted to livestock production.</p><p>Determining the land-use footprint of livestock is difficult. So far, the primary focus has been on land used for crops, due partially to the fact that it is easier to detect accurately with remote sensing: fields have distinguishable spectral characteristics, defined edges, and the location of fields is path dependent [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210051.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unlike cropland, pasture often consists of natural grassland, and differentiating grassland and pasture using remote detection is an arduous task that as of yet has no universal solution [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For this research, we define grassland as a biophysical land cover that includes areas with low-standing vegetation, including shrublands [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pasture is defined as a land use that includes any area actively utilized by livestock for grazing, which can include grassland as well as other types of land cover, including cropland [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pasture edges are often undefined, especially in areas with communal grazing, nomadic transhumance, and unclear or unenforced land ownership rights [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, little knowledge currently exists on the utilization of grasslands for pasture. Unfortunately, data on pasture extent are scarce, which hinders the accurate estimation of utilized and available land resources.</p><p>Several products attempt to map land use on a global scale. Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and IIASA and FAO [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] utilized a subtractive approach (with differing classifications and definitions), while Ramankutty et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Klein Goldewijk et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] used different allocation rules that combine remote sensing-derived land cover with national statistics. These four global products share a modicum of agreement (17% of the land use classification is in full agreement, with an additional 30% where three maps agree) but marginal pasture areas are particularly discrepant, such as in semi-arid and tundra regions, which are sparsely vegetated and contain transitional classes [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, global remote sensing products often have lower classification accuracies for grassland ecosystems, particularly in areas where transition classes and ecotones are common [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, estimating pasture area with global land cover products can only be used as general approximations. As livestock enumeration using remote sensing is currently impractical, it is necessary to develop methods of pasture allocation that combine remote sensing with ground-based data and information on local grazing practices, which is crucial for modeling livestock distribution.</p><p>The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) was the first global, gridded map of livestock density [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. With finer resolution (1 km) and more up-to-date statistics, the GLW was improved in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and again in 2018 with a more advanced spatial weighting model to allocate livestock [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The authors used the suitability for pasture as well as socioeconomic factors to predict the density of different livestock species, using national and sub-national livestock statistics. However, the accuracies of the GLW are lowest in semi-arid regions and generally in under-populated areas where livestock numbers are often underrepresented due to seasonal movement of stock in remote and inaccessible areas, and information on specific climate, biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics are not available [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, despite the high resolution, for many countries livestock statistics were used from first-level administrative divisions. For such countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Sudan (all among the world&#x02019;s 15 largest countries), this severely limits the suitability of the GLW for regional and local studies [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There have also been attempts to assess fine-scale livestock dynamics with spatial extrapolation of local livestock numbers as a proxy for the area used as pasture [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, such approaches fail to account for the productivity of grasslands, the biomass intake by the different types of grazing livestock, or regional grazing practices.</p><p>We developed a model to estimate the grazing intensity of livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and horses) in Kazakhstan. Grazing intensity is the percent utilization of net primary production, and allows for the gridded estimation of grazing pressure based on natural productivity. Kazakhstan is particularly interesting because of its long history of livestock rearing and the vast land resources suitable for grazing. The ninth-largest country in the world, Kazakhstan&#x02019;s permanent pastures and meadows were estimated at 1.87 million km<sup>2</sup> (69% of total land area) in 2014 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); by comparison, Russia had 0.93 million km<sup>2</sup> and the United States 2.51 million km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Historically, large numbers of wild herbivores shared Kazakhstan&#x02019;s grasslands with livestock, the most populous being the saiga antelope (<italic>Saiga tatarica</italic>). However, during the 1990s, populations of saiga plummeted due to the loss of enforcement of hunting quotas and illegal trade in saiga horns [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210051.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Saiga are also vulnerable to periodic, catastrophic die-offs, one of which occurred in spring 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210051.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In summer 2015, saiga in Kazakhstan numbered around 84,000 [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other wild herbivores of note in Kazakhstan include the kulan (<italic>Equus hemionus</italic>) and the goitered gazelle (<italic>Gazella subgutturosa</italic>), which in 2015 numbered around 3,500 and 13,000, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These numbers pale in comparison to grazing livestock numbers (6.2 million cattle, 18 million sheep and goats, and 2.1 million horses in 2015) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, domestic camels in 2015 numbered 170,000 [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While in some districts they represented a noticeable source of grazing demand, camels and wild herbivores contributed very little to total grazing intensity at the national scale and thus were not considered in this research.</p><p>The model estimates the distribution of livestock grazing and contributes to closing the knowledge gap regarding the spatial dimension and intensity of pasture use. We used statistical data on livestock numbers and fodder production along with recommended energy intake levels per animal type to estimate the livestock grazing demand (the total energy consumed through grazing) for Kazakhstan in 2015. Based on reported grazing practices, we applied this demand to biomass productivity maps to determine the most likely distribution of utilized pasture.

Under the Soviet system, the human population was settled in permanent villages. Livestock migration continued, but was structured and strictly regulated. To supplement grazing (especially during winter), there was a large, subsidized network of fodder supply. When the Soviet Union dissolved, so too did the fodder supply network. Yet the human population remained sedentary, with livestock held almost exclusively in small, household farms. This led to localized overgrazing around settlements, as distant outposts fell into disrepair, and long-distance migration all but stopped [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Kazakh farm structure</title><p>The type of farm that livestock are raised on in Kazakhstan determines to a great degree how the livestock are grazed [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are three distinct farm types in Kazakhstan: the largest farms are called agricultural enterprises (AE), ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands of animals. These farms are the spiritual (and often actual) descendants of Soviet farms and usually have the resources to provide high-quality fodder and support longer-distance grazing migrations. The second group are the private farms (PF). Since 2000, this is the fastest-growing farm type, and the most diverse in terms of size and grazing practices, ranging from tens to thousands of animals. The third and smallest farm type, households (HH), typically have only a few animals per unit, but overall in Kazakhstan, 60% of grazing livestock are kept in this farm type. Livestock are usually housed overnight in the owner&#x02019;s backyard, meaning that their grazing area is limited to the distance they can walk in one half-day. This immobility results from the sedentarization of farms under the Soviet regime, and the path dependency following its dissolution [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

As a way to disaggregate livestock numbers from district-level statistics to the settlement level, the human population of each settlement was used [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], along with a piecewise linear function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s001">S1 Equation</xref>) describing the relationship between settlement size and number of livestock owners, determined from expert opinion and personal observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s004">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The search radius defines the area around the settlement within which pixels are selected. Our model allows the search radii to be defined independently for each livestock/farm type combination. The search radii used in this research were developed based on farmer interviews and the findings of Kamp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and Coughenour et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Three different radii were used to simulate three different grazing practices found in Kazakhstan. For cattle, sheep, and goats on households and private farms, the search radius was set to 2 km to represent the relative immobility of these livestock. For cattle, sheep, and goats on agricultural enterprises, the search radius was set to 5 km, to represent the increased resources of the enterprises to seek better pastures farther from the settlement (displaying slightly more &#x0201c;optimal forager&#x0201d; activity) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For horses on all farm types, the search radius was set to 10 km, because horses are more mobile and rarely return to the settlement overnight, and thus have the greatest ability to approach optimal foraging. For a summary of the assumptions made in the distribution model, and their implications, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s007">S1 Table</xref>. To distribute the demand spatially and realistically, we use an iterative approach. For each combination of livestock type and farm type, a radius r is defined (2, 5, or 10 km, as defined above). For every settlement, the pixels within r are sorted according to their NPP value, and the settlement&#x02019;s demand is distributed to the pixels, choosing higher values first, and precluding chosen pixels from possible duplicate distribution. If the demand is not met within the initial search radius, the search radius is increased to 2r. The distribution process repeats with increasing search radii (3r, 4r, etc.) until the demand is satisfied. Moreover, the distribution for all settlements is performed simultaneously to allow fair competition, reflecting the reality. This results in the distribution of all available land in (n-1) radii around a settlement, with the final radius containing the last pixels distributed to meet the demand. A magnification of the results, showing the settlement-level pixel distribution, is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s005">S2 Fig</xref>. We chose to distribute the demand of sheep and goats before cattle, though their grazing areas for the most part overlap (literature indicates cattle will travel slightly further during a day) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210051.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, for sheep, goats, and cattle, farm type is more important than animal type, and the algorithm distributed all sheep, goats, and cattle in households first, then private farms, and finally agricultural enterprises. Horses, on the other hand, typically graze separate from the other livestock, and occupy areas distant from settlements, because they are more mobile and remain on the pasture overnight. To account for this, horses of all farm types were distributed last, thus receiving the pasture furthest from the settlements. Based on the characteristics of the different farm types, and the mobility of the different animal types, the livestock were distributed in this order: 1. sheep and goats in households, 2. cattle in households, 3. sheep and goats in private farms, 4. cattle in private farms, 5. sheep and goats in agricultural enterprises, 6. cattle in agricultural enterprises, 7. horses in households, 8. horses in private farms, and 9. horses in agricultural enterprises.

A common practice in Kazakhstan is the foraging of crop residues after harvest, especially on wheat fields. To account for this, we split the map into a grassland and a cropland map.

We then calculated the maximum distance from each settlement that each livestock type needed to fulfill their grazing demand under each off-take rate. To determine an accurate off-take rate for each settlement, we used the maximum grazing distances for cattle in households as the defining variable, as they, along with sheep and goats (which are distributed before cattle), are the most restricted by distance from settlement. We chose 10 km as the maximum distance for cattle in households based on the findings of Kamp et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We grouped settlements into their districts, and for each district, we selected the lowest off-take rate that corresponded to the median of maximum grazing distances for cattle in households being less than 10 km. In cases where districts had no reported cattle in households, sheep and goats in households instead were used (districts without either of these had no grazing livestock of any kind). The model was then run again, with settlements maintaining their determined off-take rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Production potentials of meat and milk</title><p>We estimated the potential to increase production of meat and milk in Kazakhstan based on the efficiency with which pasture is being used. To estimate pasture use efficiency, we took meat and milk production in 2015 from the national statistics [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We calculated pasture requirement from the model results and estimated the yield of meat and milk (tons per km<sup>2</sup> utilized) for the different livestock types. Our model results do not differentiate between beef and dairy cattle, so we made an adjustment based on the relative proportions of beef and dairy cattle. The fraction of cattle classified as dairy in 2015 for agricultural enterprises, private farms, and households was 0.40, 0.50, and 0.85, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We multiplied the land requirement by this fraction as a rough estimate for the area used by dairy cattle. We then divided milk production by the adjusted land requirement to estimate milk productivity.</p><p>We used the calculated land use efficiencies to estimate production potential. First, we made a conservative assumption that all land within 10 km of a settlement could currently be utilized. Therefore, unutilized land within 10 km of a settlement was considered for potential expansion. The modeled off-take rates were used to calculate the number of additional livestock that could be supported. Second, we proposed a scenario where pasture was grazed at its maximum sustainable intensity (30% off-take rate), and calculated the resulting unutilized area within 10 km of a settlement. Using a less conservative assumption that all land within 20 km of a settlement could be utilized, we repeated the previous two calculations. Potential increase in beef production was calculated with the assumption that all additional livestock were beef cattle. Similarly, for potential increase in milk production, we assumed that all additional livestock were dairy cattle. Therefore, the results presented are &#x0201c;either-or&#x0201d;, and the reality likely falls somewhere in between.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec009"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Grazing gap and demand distribution</title><p>The grazing demand was calculated for each animal and farm type combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Regarding milk production, cattle on agricultural enterprises are clearly the most land productive (when adjusted for the proportion of dairy production).

Assuming the estimated off-take rates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g009">Fig 9</xref> as business-as-usual (BAU), the additional pasture utilized was 0.14 million km<sup>2</sup>, with an associated energy of 29.9 PJ. Assuming a proportional increase in fodder production (i.e., that the grazing gap remains the same), if the additional 0.14 million km<sup>2</sup> of pasture was used entirely for cattle on agricultural enterprises, beef production could be increased by 0.13 Mt, an increase of 31% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Conversely, if all expansion was used for dairy on agricultural enterprises, dairy milk production could be increased by 3.11 Mt (above 2015 level) under the business-as-usual scenario, an increase of 60%. These are conservative estimates, as off-take rates were very low for most settlements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g009">Fig 9</xref>). If all land within 10 km was used at its maximum sustainable off-take rate (30%), and if all additional livestock on pasture within 10 km were cattle on agricultural enterprises, beef production could be increased 1.91 Mt (above 2015 level), an increase of 457%.

As such, it cannot be compared directly to existing products. Most maps of livestock distribution or pasture extent are at the global scale, and we endeavored to create a more accurate map by focusing on the regional scale. We used detailed information on livestock nutritive requirements to calculate the total energy demand and we used district-level data on fodder supply to determine the grazing gap and grazing demand. To measure the energy available for grazing, we obtained NPP estimates as opposed to using suitability indices, which allowed us to estimate grazing intensity instead of probability of pasture occurrence or stocking density. Based on extensive literature review and field experience, we defined regional grazing practices specific to different farm and animal types to better distribute grazing demand. The result is a model that can distribute pasture utilization at fine spatial scales.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Comparison to global products</title><p>We compared our results visually to global products. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] shows very dense populations of cattle, sheep, and goats in southcentral and southeastern Kazakhstan, whereas the north and northeast is less dense, but fairly uniform across a larger area. This agrees with the high off-take rates calculated in the south and the low off-take rates in the north, which results in very large continuous pasture in the north (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g009">Fig 9</xref>). More recently, Nicolas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] improved on the GLW by, among other things, preventing the GLW from placing livestock where humans are absent, which was also the aim of our model. However, they found no systematic improvements, likely due in part to their coarse distinction between urban and rural areas. The definition of urban and rural areas (and the presence of livestock in each) varies greatly between countries, and using one gradient for the entire world is unlikely to produce accurate results.</p><p>Compared visually to Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], our model found less utilized pasture. This was due to the subtractive method used by Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]&#x02014;if land was not used for crops or anything else and as long as it was above the precipitation threshold, then it was considered grazing land. That qualifies almost all land in Kazakhstan as grazing land, including lands&#x02014;such as in central Kazakhstan&#x02014;where few, if any, livestock exist. However, Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also published a grazing suitability map, which shows most of Kazakhstan, save for the far south and southeast, to be in the lowest suitability class. Though suitability is not necessarily related to utilization, the areas of high suitability (the south and southeast) match our areas of high off-take rates. Overall, the four global grazing land-use maps reviewed in Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have low agreement in Kazakhstan, and especially in the drier central and southwest part of the country, where the difference in estimates of grazing area range by up to 100%. In another study based on Haberl et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] estimation of Human Appropriation of NPP, Erb et al.

Shortcomings in the grazing intensity distribution include the use of FAO statistics for livestock numbers, the resolution of the 2007 GLW (5 km), as well as the spatial scale of feed intake estimates (usually national level) [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. These are general issues with global-scale models, which underline the usefulness of regional-scale approaches, as long as these can make use of data with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Further comparison to our results can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s006">S3 Fig</xref>. As regional studies of the spatial distribution of grazing intensity do not exist, we compared our results to the global product by Fetzel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], cut to the area of Kazakhstan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210051.s006">S3a Fig</xref>). While the resolution of the maps is not comparable, the suitability algorithm employed by Fetzel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] resulted in a similar relative distribution of grazing intensity. The takeaway from this comparison is that our maps agree in the areas of high, and low, grazing intensity. There are a number of reasons why the results are not directly comparable, not the least of which being that Fetzel et al. measured grazing intensity in 2000, when grazing livestock numbers were 57% of their 2015 levels [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Also, the assumptions and inputs used in our model were specific to Kazakhstan. Our calculation of grazing gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g004">Fig 4</xref>) produced a much higher grazing demand in Kazakhstan than the average grazing demand calculated in Herrero et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] for the region defined as the Commonwealth of Independent States. Additionally, our search parameters&#x02014;using settlements as &#x0201c;home bases&#x0201d;&#x02014;resulted in a smaller, more intensely grazed area. One noticeable inconsistency between the two maps is in the east. This is likely due to the very high NPP in the region, which would make it seemingly ideal for intense grazing. However, there are relatively few livestock in the region (which is only seen in district-level statistics), and much of the far eastern parts are covered in forest, which were not available for grazing in our model.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Validation</title><p>For this research, we combined remotely sensed NPP, livestock statistics, feed recommendations, and allocation rules. Each of these components may contribute a degree of uncertainty. For instance, official statistics can be subject to manipulation and inconsistent measurements, particularly during the transition period. We utilized 2015 livestock numbers, after the reformation of reporting livestock statistics that occurred in 2010&#x02013;11, which included livestock tagging. Similarly, actual feed consumption may vary according to individual production costs, output, and available fodder resources or other endogenous factors, such as experience and background of the farmer. Yet, agricultural producers tend to follow the recommendations of the extension services and the Ministry of Agricultre.</p><p>McNaughton et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] summarize the pitfalls associated with ground-based measurements of grazing intensity, mainly&#x02014;but not limited to&#x02014;the difficulty in measuring plant growth, removal, and re-growth over a season. More recently, remote sensing-based global pasture products acknowledge the inherent difficulty in detecting pasture existence, much less determining grazing intensity [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210051.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Grazing, especially low-intensity grazing, can leave almost no detectable signature. Adding the mobility of livestock and differing land covers, detection and measurement of grazing intensity is extremely difficult. As elaborated by Verburg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], improving or re-thinking the current methods of ground-truthing is a very immediate need in land use and land cover products and a cause for future research. Our research combined satellite-derived data (NPP) with sub-national livestock statistics. This makes our approach a member of the group of methods described by Kuemmerle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that, while not ground-truthed themselves, use ground-truthed products to disaggregate spatially-aggregated data, a group that also includes the work by Neumann et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and the GLW [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Targeting areas for livestock expansion</title><p>Expanding on the GLW, Chang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] estimated the potential livestock density for Europe and found that virtually everywhere there is large room for expansion. However, competition for land use in Europe is very high, and expansion is unlikely to occur at a large scale. This is not the case in Kazakhstan, where land is abundant and much of it is not utilized or utilized at low intensity levels. Increases in livestock mobility through improved infrastructure can reduce localized overgrazing and allow pastoralists to regain access to the vast steppe that is currently out of reach. Areas high in NPP, but with low off-take rates and relatively low livestock numbers, can be found in the east and in the northwest of Kazakhstan. These regions could be the easiest targets for increases in livestock production. In the south, there appears to be less pasture utilization in terms of area, but that belies the much higher off-take rates. It is possible that a 10 km threshold for household livestock is too restrictive in the south, where a much higher proportion of livestock are kept on household farms, and some medium-range seasonal migration is known to still occur [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This would result in more utilized pasture, with lower off-takes rates. In the north, a much higher proportion of livestock are held on agricultural enterprises, and the relatively low numbers of household livestock contribute to the low calculated off-take rate, usually 10%. This forces the agricultural enterprise cattle to range at large distances, further than 100 km for several settlements in Akmola Province. While this is certainly possible for agricultural enterprises with labor and capital resources, it is more likely that they graze closer to the farm at higher off-take rates. It is well-documented that overgrazing of pasture is still a feature of Kazakh livestock production, especially around settlements [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This would result in an overall smaller utilized pasture in the north, with higher off-take rates.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Notes on model inputs and assumptions</title><p>In the estimation of maximum sustainable off-take rate, we used the findings of Propastin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], based on 14 test sites in Karaganda Oblast. While they have corroborated their results with other similar studies, in fact the proportion of above- to belowground NPP varies depending on the plant species, soil type, soil texture, and climate [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. To date, robust datasets that map the spatial distribution of above- and belowground NPP in Kazakhstan are lacking. In similar fashion, no countrywide spatial datasets exist on the energy content of predominant species. In our model, a distinction was made only between cropland and grassland, and another improvement on the energy supply side would be to distribute spatially energy content based on predominant plant species. Including the spatial heterogeneity of the above- and belowground NPP and the plant energy content would improve the accuracy of our model&#x02019;s estimation of grazing supply.</p><p>Our study found an overall grazing gap of 78%. Erb et al. [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] report the overall grazing gap for 11 world regions, with Central Asia and the Russian Federation having an aggregated grazing gap of around 40%. However, Russia has a large amount of production on primarily mixed feedlot systems and thus a low grazing gap, and similar climatic regions to Kazakhstan, such as Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa, have grazing gaps between 70 and 80% [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We should note, in Kazakhstan, it is likely that there is substantial fodder production that is not being reported and is therefore unaccounted for in our model. Hay cutting by households and private farms on grassland is a common practice and usually goes unreported. At the same time, communication with local experts and farmers suggested that it is unlikely that fodder imports from other countries occur in significant quantities, which is supported in official statistics [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, some limited amounts of high-energy fodder may be traded from districts with large cropland areas to districts with large grassland areas (and vice versa with hay moving from grassland-dominant districts to cropland-dominant districts), which has not been accounted for in our model. However, the degree of fodder transport between districts is unknown.</p><p>Also unknown is the extent to which livestock utilize crop residues. As residues may or may not be left in the field, there are no statistics on the yield of residues available for livestock. However, expert opinion and field experience suggested that there is wide-scale grazing of harvested lands, and a lack of physical boundaries (such as fences) led us to assume in our model that all crop residues were available to livestock. NPP from crop residues available to livestock was calculated to be 293 PJ. This is small in comparison with the grassland supply of 3537 PJ (less than 7% of the total energy supply, yet occupying 14% of the total area), but is a significant source of energy for livestock, particularly in northcentral Kazakhstan. Notably, the time of year that livestock forage on croplands changes from year to year. The wheat harvest can sometimes last into winter when weather conditions prevent earlier harvest. In our model, we do not account for this, making the implicit assumption that most residues from these late harvests will still be available for foraging the following spring, or for horses that graze year-round. Indeed, for an average annual grazing supply map such as we used, whether the residues are consumed in spring or in fall is moot.</p><p>The area utilized in 2015 covers much of the highest-productivity areas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g002">Fig 2</xref>, and there are clear trends of pasturing near rivers and in other areas of high NPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g009">Fig 9</xref>). As the restriction to settlement location is much more important than the productivity of the pasture, this is a result of the location of the settlements and not the model search algorithm. Most settlements were founded because of their proximity to water or other biophysical characteristics that favor higher biomass productivity. Indeed, the average energy production on land within 10 km of a settlement in Kazakhstan is 1.75 MJ/m<sup>2</sup>, whereas land further than 10 km from a settlement averages 1.37 MJ/m<sup>2</sup>. This also supports the hypothesis of abandonment of pastures occurring mainly on marginal lands [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows that the off-take rate increases more than the expected function 1/x as off-take rate decreases, indicating lower productivity as the distance from settlement increases.</p><p>The model assumes that livestock are only located where people are located, similar to assumptions made by others [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. While this is generally the case, livestock are not distributed evenly among the settlements, especially on agricultural enterprises. For example, agricultural enterprises hold a large number of animals and are commonly located in medium and small settlements, where they are the main source of jobs for the residents. Since some (but not all) small settlements have an agricultural enterprise, there is no way to place agricultural enterprises accurately within a district without preexistent knowledge of their location. This means that, in reality, herd sizes in small settlements are very unbalanced, whereas in the model, similarly sized settlements within a district receive equal numbers of livestock. Additionally, settlements that exist for a specific industrial purpose may have pasture distributed in the model where in fact no livestock are kept.</p><p>Briefly mentioned but unelaborated on is the role that access to water plays in livestock distribution. Wells have been an integral part of grazing migrations in Kazakhstan for centuries, and during Soviet times, thousands of new pump wells were installed to accommodate the regulated migrations of much larger herds [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Around these wells, outposts were erected and served as seasonal base camps for livestock herders. However, many of these outposts were abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the wells fell into disrepair [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. There is currently no accessible countrywide data on the prevalence or location of working wells or occupied outposts. For this reason, wells and outposts were not considered in the distribution of livestock. Inclusion of these water sources as potential home bases for livestock would give the search algorithm access to grazing supply that was previously far from settlements, and thus it is possible that there is pasture utilized in remote areas not captured in the model.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Livestock productivity on private farms</title><p>The low meat and milk productivity of cattle on private farms is surprising (<xref rid="pone.0210051.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), especially given that private farms have much lower grazing gaps than households (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In the scenarios explored for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g010">Fig 10</xref>, a similar expansion on only private farms would result in an increase of 67 kt (16%), compared to 113 kt for agricultural enterprises. Through personal observation and anecdotal evidence, this lower productivity could be because private farmers do not have the resources necessary to provide proper nutrition to their livestock, resulting in suboptimal meat and milk production. Indeed, outside of agricultural enterprises, almost all fodder produced is hay, which is one of the least energy-rich fodder types. On agricultural enterprises, hay comprises 57% of fodder by mass, whereas on private farms hay comprises 95% of fodder by mass [<xref rid="pone.0210051.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, in many regions private farms are essentially large households, and have similar grazing practices. In those situations, private farms at best share pasture with household livestock and at worst are pushed to the less productive lands far from the settlement. In the model, private farm livestock are always distributed after the same type of livestock in households, which biases private farm livestock to pastures with lower NPP, though across the country the effect should be rather small. Private farms are currently the most dynamic and fastest growing sector in livestock farming, but so far, their efficiency has not surpassed that of household farms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have presented a new model to allocate livestock and pasture spatially, using a map of biomass production and information on animal types, farm types, and fodder intake. Our methods of delineating land used by livestock and estimating the intensity with which the livestock are using the land allow pinpointing the extent and location of underutilized grazing resources.</p><p>The model enabled a gridded estimate of the utilized pasture in Kazakhstan, which is a prime example of a country well suited to grazing livestock production. Kazakhstan&#x02019;s dry continental climate also reduces the suitability of livestock production&#x02019;s main competitor for land, crop production, making it a suitable target area for development of range-based livestock production. Our results show that despite relatively low natural productivity, ample capacity exists to increase livestock production in Kazakhstan because large areas are characterized by low pasture utilization and off-take rate, and available biomass resources could support many more grazing animals, especially in the east and the northwest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210051.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Under conservative estimates of grazing range constraints and with 2015 productivity levels, beef production could be increased by 0.13 Mt (31%) or milk production by 3.11 Mt (60%), or some combination. However, harnessing even a fraction of these potentials would necessitate infrastructure development measures, such as more, improved processing facilities and improved road networks and market access. Repaired wells and outposts would allow the rejuvenation of old migration patterns and would open up distant pastures for even more potential production increases.</p><p>This research is an important step forward in the field of livestock mapping. Our model uses much finer-scale inputs than other global-scale products, and a direct measurement of biomass production, enabling us to make a gridded estimate of pasture distribution based on the energy demand of the livestock. The search algorithm we created is easily transferable to other regions where livestock are restricted to a central point, but can be adapted to any region where grazing patterns can be defined. The result of our research can be used to find patterns in livestock distribution, and to target areas where the supply is underutilized. Moreover, our results help the spatial targeting of possible investments for expanding the production of grazing livestock, including assessing the tradeoffs of production expansion with greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity conservation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210051.s001"><label>S1 Equation</label><caption><title>The piecewise linear function used to estimate the number of livestock owners in a settlement based on the total settlement population.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210051.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210051.s002"><label>S2 Equation</label><caption><title>The equation used to estimate the number of livestock in each age group in each district in 2015 using the more detailed 2006 agricultural census.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210051.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210051.s003"><label>S3 Equation</label><caption><title>The equation used to estimate the amount of energy supplied by fodder to each livestock species in each district in 2015.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210051.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210051.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Piecewise function for the distribution of livestock to settlements based on human population.</title><p>The steps are 95% from 0&#x02013;1,000, 80% at 5,000, 30% at 10,000, 10% at 50,000, and 0.5% at 1 million residents (not shown), with linear interpolation.
