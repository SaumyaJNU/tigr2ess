Gluten is found in the seeds of cereals like bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> ssp. <italic>aestivum</italic>) and spelt (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> ssp. <italic>spelta</italic>). The development of new varieties lacking immunogenic peptides is one of the strategies currently investigated to address the CD problem. Among gluten proteins, &#x003b1;-gliadins display the strongest immunogenicity with four main T-cell stimulatory epitopes. The objective of this work was to study the expression of &#x003b1;-gliadin epitopes related to CD in a wide collection of 121 spelt accessions (landraces and varieties, spring and winter accessions) from different provenances, and to analyze the correlation between the presence of epitope sequences in gDNA and their expression (cDNA). The effect of environmental factors (harvest year and N fertilization) on the epitope expression was also investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">TaqMan probes targeting the canonical form of the epitopes were used to evaluate the epitope expression levels. Significant variations in the amount of epitope transcripts were identified between accessions and according to the provenances. Spring accessions showed a significantly higher immunogenicity than winter ones and no influence of spelt breeding on the epitope expression levels could be assessed when comparing landraces and varieties from Northwestern Europe. No correlation was observed between quantitative PCR results obtained from cDNA and gDNA for 45 accessions tested, stressing the need to use markers focusing on epitope transcripts rather than on genomic sequences. A relative stability of the amount of epitopes expressed by a same accession across four harvest years was detected. The fertilization strategy, evaluated through seven N fertilization modalities applied to two commercial spelt varieties, did not influence the epitope expression of the first variety, whereas it had a slight effect for the second one.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The results obtained in this work showed that the CD-related epitope expression greatly fluctuated among the spelt accessions studied.

The inflammatory response of the immune system to the presence of dietary gluten leads to a flattening of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in the malabsorption of nutrients. This pathology affects genetically predisposed individuals. While its occurrence has risen during last decades to reach ~&#x02009;1% of the human population, most patients affected by CD are still undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Gluten is composed of storage proteins from wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. ssp. <italic>aestivum</italic>), spelt [<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> ssp. <italic>spelta</italic> (L.) Thell.], barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) and rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.). Oat (<italic>Avena sativa</italic> L.) also displays a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called avenins, which do not contain any CD-related epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The oat immunogenicity has been the subject of many discussions, but it seems that, when gluten peptides are found in oat products, they come from contaminations with wheat, barley or rye in the production chain, rather than from oat itself. Long-term food studies have confirmed the safety of oats for CD patients and the putative health benefit of oat products in a gluten-free diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The daily intake of gluten should be kept under 50&#x000a0;mg for CD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and they must thus follow a strict life-long gluten-free diet to avoid intra- and extra-intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, bowel pain, fatigue, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, headaches and growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Gluten proteins are usually classified into soluble monomeric gliadins and insoluble polymeric glutenins according to their alcohol solubility. Gliadins confer viscosity to dough and are divided into three structural groups according to their electrophoretic mobility: &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-, &#x003b3;- and &#x003c9;-gliadins. Glutenins are responsible for dough elasticity and classified into high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW- and LMW-GS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Gluten proteins display a high content of proline and glutamine amino acids, which make them partially resistant to gastrointestinal digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The &#x003b1;-gliadins are recognized as the most toxic group of gluten proteins affecting CD patients since they trigger the strongest T-cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-gliadins are encoded by a multigene family. Indeed, the Gli-2 loci, where the &#x003b1;-gliadin genes are located, include a high number of &#x003b1;-gliadin gene copies. However, it has been shown that a high proportion of these genes are pseudogenes as they display a premature stop codon in their reading frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recent researches found different amounts of active &#x003b1;-gliadin genes according to the accession studied and the methodology used. Kawaura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones covering about 200&#x000a0;kb for each Gli2 locus from the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring. They highlighted 12 intact &#x003b1;-gliadin genes, among which 9 were expressed. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and Cho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found higher numbers of active genes: they respectively showed that the Xiaoyan 81 bread wheat cultivar displayed 25 intact expressed &#x003b1;-gliadin sequences through a third-generation RNA sequencing technique and that the Keumkang bread wheat cultivar flour contained 27 different &#x003b1;-gliadins through a proteomic approach. The &#x003b1;-gliadin proteins display four main T-cell stimulatory epitopes involved in CD: the major DQ2.5-glia-&#x003b1;1 and DQ2.5-glia-&#x003b1;2 (P{F/Y}PQPQLPY and PQPQLPYPQ, respectively) and the minor DQ2.5-glia-&#x003b1;3 and DQ8-glia-&#x003b1;1 epitopes (FRPQQPYPQ and QGSFQPSQQ, respectively). In the &#x003b1;-gliadins from the D genome, the DQ2.5-glia-&#x003b1;2 epitope can be displayed in one, two or three copies and leads, when three copies are present, to the most immunogenic fragment of &#x003b1;-gliadin sequences, known as the 33-mer fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Each of the four main &#x003b1;-gliadin T-cell stimulatory epitopes involved in CD can be displayed in its canonical form recognized by the immune system of CD patients. However, allelic variants of these epitopes, resulting from amino acids substitution or deletion, also exists among the &#x003b1;-gliadin genes. Interestingly, these allelic variants have a reduced or suppressed immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Several techniques have been developed to measure the toxic potential held in the cereal grains. The first one is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which mainly exists in the form of test kits to quantitate the amount of gluten in food samples and detect gluten contamination. These kits are based on different antibodies which have been raised against gluten proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the restricted specificity of the antibodies regarding canonical epitopes limits the accuracy of ELISA tests to study the immunogenic potential of varieties. Amaya-Gonzalez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] developed another technique based on aptamers to detect the 33-mer fragment. This tool allows quantifying the gluten content through an electrochemical competitive enzyme-linked assay on magnetic particles with a six-fold improved sensitivity compared to the ELISA reference test. Nevertheless, these aptamers do not focus on individual epitopes and the absence of cross-reactivity with allelic variants of the 33-mer has not been demonstrated. Two other strategies have recently been developed and make possible discriminating canonical epitopes from their allelic variants: liquid chromatography combined to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on the one hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and TaqMan probes on the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The LC-MS technique is designed to study the epitope composition at the protein level, whereas TaqMan probes focus on &#x003b1;-gliadin transcripts. A relationship was observed between the results of Van den Broeck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], who developed a LC-MS method, and those of Salentijn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] who carried out a high throughput RNA sequencing of &#x003b1;-gliadin sequences coming from the same accession.</p><p id="Par30">Several possibilities are currently being investigated to address the CD problem, like gluten detoxification, modulation of mucosal permeability, antigen presentation blockade, raising monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of T-cell recruitment or oral tolerance induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Among them, the development of new cereal varieties that lack immunogenic peptide, but still display good baking characteristics, is a promising approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Indeed, bread wheat and related taxa display a high genetic variability which can be exploited. Among them, spelt is also a member of the <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> species. It displays interesting features such as its adaptability to poor soils, harsh climatic conditions and low-input tolerance. Moreover, spelt germplasm collections are characterized by a high genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Illustrations of this variability were observed for features such as immunogenic potential, bread-making qualities and content in proteins, lipids, micronutrients and fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, tools used to study the CD-related immunogenic potential of bread wheat can also be used for spelt since it displays the same epitope allelic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Whereas bread wheat has already been broadly studied for its CD-related content, only a few publications has approached it for spelt, and never with a plant collection representative of its large diversity. Ribeiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Escarnot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] highlighted higher reactivities for spelt accessions than for bread wheat ones while G&#x000e9;linas and McKinnon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] did not observe any significant difference. However, these three works did not study the immunogenic content strictly speaking given that they used ELISA kits which detect both canonical epitopes and allelic variants. Ozuna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] performed a high throughput sequencing of the 5&#x02032; end of &#x003b1;-gliadin sequences from 16 bread wheat and 11 spelt accessions and they showed that the expression profile of the 33-mer peptide was similar in both sub-species. Ozuna and her colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] also analyzed the occurrence of the four major T-cell stimulatory epitopes among the &#x003b1;-gliadin sequences reported on the NCBI database and they found comparable frequencies in spelt and bread wheat sequences. Schalk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Prandi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] used a LC-MS strategy to specifically quantify the immunogenic content of spelt and bread wheat accessions. Among the four major &#x003b1;-gliadin CD-related epitopes studied in this work, Prandi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] quantified the expression of the DQ2.5-glia-&#x003b1;3 epitope whereas Schalk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] focused on the 33-mer peptide. In both studies, spelt and bread wheat accessions did not set apart from each other. Thus, the few available studies enabling to compare the immunogenic content of spelt to the one of bread wheat does not seem to indicate major differences between these two subspecies. However, spelt germplasm collections display a high level of genetic diversity, which has never been studied in the framework of celiac disease.</p><p id="Par32">Beyond the search for non- or low-immunogenic accessions, attention should be also paid to the putative influence of cultivation techniques on the amount of immunogenic sequences expressed. Among the factors influencing the expression of gluten proteins, the nitrogen (N) fertilization strategy has been identified as an important component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-gliadins being a sulfur (S)-rich prolamin protein class, their expression has also been shown to be affected by the S nutrition in einkorn grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the N rates applied influenced the expression of &#x003b1;-gliadins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The expression of the four main &#x003b1;-gliadin epitopes involved in CD could thus be affected by the fertilization strategy since similar trends between the global expression of &#x003b1;-gliadins and the amount of epitope transcripts have been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Consequently, it would be relevant to investigate this hypothesis and analyze whether an appropriate fertilization strategy could have a beneficial impact in reducing the amount of expressed epitopes.</p><p id="Par33">The objective of this work was to study the potential of spelt regarding the immunogenicity related to CD as a function of both genetic and environmental factors. This was carried out by (i) analyzing the expression profile of the four main &#x003b1;-gliadin T-cell stimulatory epitopes in a wide collection of spelt accessions using epitope-specific TaqMan probes, (ii) analyzing the correlation between this expression and qPCR results from gDNA samples, and (iii) investigating whether environment and crop practices could have an impact on this expression by testing its stability over consecutive years and comparing different N fertilization treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Epitope expression profiling in a wide set of spelt accessions</title><p id="Par34">The expression levels of the four main canonical epitopes involved in CD were determined on 121 spelt accessions, including cultivars and landraces from Northwestern Europe (Belgium, Germany, Switzerland) as well as landraces from Eastern Europe, Spain and Near and Middle East (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

To reach this objective, a collection of 121 spelt accessions, representative of different geographical provenances, status (cultivar and landrace) and habits (winter and spring) was assembled and their expression profile of CD-related epitopes was evaluated.</p><p id="Par44">The profiling of the epitope expression among the 121 spelt accessions revealed very high variations, with a factor of 28.4 between the lowest and the highest epitope expression level measured, which is in line with the high level of spelt genetic diversity previously reported according to microsatellite markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], glutenin subunit variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and variance in agronomic traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Highly significant differences between accession provenances were highlighted. The Spanish and Tajik accessions stood out from the others by, respectively, high and low amounts of epitope transcripts measured for each accession of these provenances. This feature can be linked to the work of Bertin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Studying the genetic diversity and structure of the spelt gene pool by using microsatellite markers, they showed that almost all Spanish and Tajik accessions clustered together in two distinct groups which clearly set them apart from spelts of other geographical provenances. In addition, these results are also in line with previous studies which focused on only one accession of each geographical provenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The main spelt breeding programs in the world have been led in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, with official research programs starting around 1950. The epitope expression levels of cultivars and landraces from these countries were compared to each other to highlight a putative effect of spelt breeding on CD immunogenicity. The statistical analysis did not show any difference between these two groups. Thus, the selection carried out in spelt breeding programs do not seem to influence the epitope expression. This could agree with the results obtained on wheat by Kasarda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], who showed that breeding during the twentieth century did not increase the gluten content in the United States. However, the results obtained by Kasarda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and in this study must be compared with caution since the gluten content does not provide direct information about the &#x003b1;-gliadin immunogenic content. More recently, Schalk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay, did not show any higher amount of 33-mer peptide in modern versus old wheat cultivars. In contrast, Ribeiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] showed in ELISA assays that landraces presented a higher reactivity than varieties in bread wheat. However, they used the R5 monoclonal antibody, which is normally used to quantitate the amount of gluten in food samples and is not specific to CD-related epitopes, thus revealing both immunogenic and non-immunogenic epitopes altogether.</p><p id="Par46">The analysis of expression data according to habit, i.e. winter or spring spelt, showed that spring accessions displayed on average a higher amount of epitope transcripts than the winter ones, whether provenances were analyzed together or separately. These differences in the epitope expression can have two explanations. Firstly, they could be linked to the differences in the gene pools used in breeding programs for spring versus winter accessions. Secondly, they could also be attributed to the differential environmental effect due to the sowing date (October versus March, respectively). The epitope expression levels may indirectly give an idea of the &#x003b1;-gliadin expression, as shown in Dubois et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and could thus be linked to the bread-making properties. Interestingly, Maghirang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], comparing spring and winter bread wheat accessions, showed that the grains and flour of spring accessions displayed better bread-making qualities than winter ones. In the context of CD, if these higher quality properties go hand in hand with higher immunogenicity, it thus means that it would be more interesting to work with winter spelt varieties rather than spring ones &#x02013; which is already the case in spelt breeding countries like Belgium, Germany and Switzerland &#x02013; to develop low celiac potential accessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Evaluation of the putative correlation between expressed and genomic epitope sequences</title><p id="Par47">The aim was to investigate the relation between the genomic occurrence of sequences encoding for immunogenic epitopes and their expression. In addition, this comparison also allowed analyzing whether the epitope-specific TaqMan probes could be used on gDNA, which would be simpler and cheaper than on cDNA, to have an accurate idea of accession immunogenicity. The qPCR results obtained from gDNA samples of 45 accessions were compared to those derived from cDNA samples. Relative quantities measured showed a factor of 28.4 (from 0.14 to 3.97) and 5.7 (from 0.11 to 0.63) between the lowest and the highest values for cDNA and gDNA samples respectively. This indicates that the use of epitope-specific TaqMan probes on gDNA leads to an underestimation of the variability in epitope content among the accessions. Moreover, the analysis of variance revealed an absence of correlation between these two sets of data. Thus, when aiming at evaluating the immunogenicity of an accession, the use of epitope-specific TaqMan probes on gDNA does not constitute a valid alternative to the epitope expression study.</p><p id="Par48">The absence of correlation between the two sets of data (cDNA versus gDNA) is striking but could be explained by the multigenic character of the &#x003b1;-gliadin family and the abundance of pseudogenes. Previous studies pointed out the high and variable number of &#x003b1;-gliadin coding sequences held in the haploid genome of bread wheat, ranging from 25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] to 150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], depending on the variety. Among these coding sequences, it was demonstrated by Anderson and Greene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] that about half of them were pseudogenes, due to the presence of at least one premature stop codon (PSC). More recently, Ozuna et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found pseudogenes proportions of 39, 76 and 63% in the genomes of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploidy wheat species, respectively. When measuring the genomic epitope content with the TaqMan probe/primer systems used in this work, pseudogenes are also detected, unless the PSC is located in the epitope sequence targeted by the TaqMan probe or the primer hybridization site. On the contrary, pseudogenes are practically absent in cDNA samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and are thus not detected when studying the epitope expression profile on the cDNA. This may explain the absence of correlation highlighted in this study between the occurrence of &#x003b1;-gliadin epitope sequences in the spelt genome and their expression levels.</p><p id="Par49">Despite the absence of correlation between qPCR values from gDNA and cDNA samples, spring spelt accessions displayed a significantly lower occurrence of epitope sequences in their genome, while their expression of epitope transcripts was significantly higher than in winter spelts. This could be explained by two hypotheses: either the putative higher amount of pseudogenes in winter spelt accessions and/or the spring environmental conditions that would favor the epitope expression. These observations underline the complexity to lead breeding strategies when dealing with the CD problem and demonstrate the need to work with molecular markers focusing on epitope transcripts rather than on genomic sequences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Influence of harvest year and impact of N fertilization</title><p id="Par50">It has already been shown that environmental conditions, and thus the harvest year, can influence gluten composition in bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and that the N fertilization strategy (amount and splitting) can impact the grain protein content and the relative abundances of the different seed storage proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">To investigate whether the harvest year could have an impact on the immunogenicity level, the expression of the four major &#x003b1;-gliadin canonical epitopes was evaluated in 10 contrasted accessions harvested during four consecutive years. This revealed a significant effect of the accessions on the epitope expression levels, whereas no impact of the harvest year was observed. This contrasts with the results of Schalk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] who showed that the harvest year had a significant influence on the 33-mer content in four bread wheat cultivars grown at the same location in Hungary and harvested in 2011, 2012 and 2014. The authors even suggested that the environmental factor had a greater influence on the 33-mer content than the genetic background of the four wheat cultivars. However, these results are not really comparable since the years and locations differ; these discrepancies could be partly attributed to different growing conditions as Hungary&#x02019;s continental climate may lead to periods of drought more frequently. The genotype x environment interaction highlighted in this work could explain these contradictory results as well. In addition, these discrepancies could also find an explanation in the fact that the traits quantified in the present study and in the one of Schalk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] are not the same (expression of the four main &#x003b1;-gliadin epitopes vs 33-mer, respectively).</p><p id="Par52">Interestingly, the analysis of climatic conditions for each year in Gembloux during the grain filling period revealed some differences (see additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>): whereas the climatic conditions have been by far the wettest during the 2016 grain filling period, climatic data for 2017 display the opposite trend with a higher mean temperature and a low level of rainfalls. Despite these fluctuating meteorological conditions, no significant differences in the epitope expression levels have been pointed out according to the harvest year.</p><p id="Par53">However, the statistical analysis still highlighted an interaction between the accession effect and the harvest year. This means that, even if the harvest year parameter taken alone does not have a significant influence, the epitope expression evolution from 1 year to another is not the same for each accession, some accession/harvest year combinations leading to significantly different epitope expressions levels than others.</p><p id="Par54">The influence of N fertilization on the amount of epitope transcripts was evaluated on a Belgian and a German spelt cultivar, i.e. Cosmos and Zollernspelz, respectively. Seven N modalities, differing by the N amount and splitting, were applied. This split application of N fertilizer has been pointed out as an effective way of improving wheat protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] showed that N splitting changes the grain protein composition by increasing the proportions of gliadins and glutenins, leading to an improved baking quality of wheat flour. They even postulated that N splitting is a more effective way to improve wheat quality than the increase in the N applied, offering the potential to reduce the amount of N fertilizer.</p><p id="Par55">The highest epitope expression levels were reached at 20 DPA, whatever the accession or the N treatment modality. This is in accordance with the &#x003b1;-gliadin expression peak previously observed around 20 DPA in bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The analysis of variance revealed a slight effect of the fertilization strategy on the amount of epitope transcripts measured at 20 DPA for Zollernspelz, but not for Cosmos. Wieser and Seilmeier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] also noticed that the degree of N fertilization effects on the quantities and proportions of flour protein groups were strongly dependent on the variety. The absence of difference in epitope expression for Cosmos cultivar can be linked to the work of Garcia-Molina and Barro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] who worked with the bread wheat cultivar Bobwhite and showed that the application of increasing amounts of N fertilizer did not modify the &#x003b1;-gliadin content for some fertilizing strategies. Bonnot et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] also highlighted that the quantity of &#x003b1;-gliadins in einkorn grains was not significantly modified by the N nutrition; however, their synthesis was affected by the S nutrition. For Zollernspelz, the global trend &#x02013; i.e. increasing epitope expression when raising the N fertilization &#x02013; is in line with the accumulation of gliadins and total prolamin content when increasing N fertilization, as reported in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">The development of new varieties lacking immunogenic peptides is one of the strategies currently investigated to face the CD issue. The knowledge of available diversity is a crucial information for breeding purposes. This work provides useful information about the diversity held in a wide collection of spelt cultivars and landraces from different geographical provenances, in terms of CD-related epitope expression levels. Some accessions were shown to display a low CD-related content, but they cannot be safely consumed by celiac patients since even low amounts of immunogenic epitopes still stimulate the immune system. This work, however, provides important knowledge about the available plant material which could be mobilized in breeding programs combining traditional and new promising molecular approaches. A correlation analysis revealed no correlation between the epitope contents measured on cDNA and gDNA samples of identical accessions. This could be linked to the multigenic character of the &#x003b1;-gliadin family and the high number of pseudogenes, making conventional breeding alone probably not efficient enough to develop celiac-safe varieties. However, several promising molecular approaches are currently being investigated in bread wheat or barley, like RNA interference strategies with hairpin RNA constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] or antisense constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and the generation of deletion lines lacking loci encoding for &#x003b1;-gliadins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In addition, new genome editing technologies have been shown to be efficient to significantly reduce the &#x003b1;-gliadin immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The epitope expression stability was evaluated by harvesting seeds during four consecutive years and by studying the influence of different N fertilization strategies. Even if an interaction between the accession and harvest year effects was pointed out, the environmental factors investigated did not seem to have a major impact on the epitope expression. Consequently, lowering the CD-related epitope content by modifying environmental conditions and/or applying a specific method of N fertilization could be inefficient. However, the genotype x environment interaction does not enable to draw definitive conclusions and it would thus be interesting to study further the environmental influence on the expression of CD-related epitopes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Plant materials and field trials</title><p id="Par57">A collection of 121 spelt accessions was constituted with grains obtained from various sources, namely: the Agroscope (Nyon, Switzerland), the Center for Genetic Resources (Wageningen, The Netherlands), the Walloon Agricultural Research Center (Gembloux, Belgium), the Crop Research Institute (Prague, Czech Republic), the Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (Gatersleben, Germany), the United States Department of Agriculture (Washington, USA) and the Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (Saint Petersburg, Russia) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).
