    "Spot blotch (SB) caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, is one of the most important diseases of wheat in the eastern part of south Asia causing considerable yield loss to the wheat crop. There is an urgent need to identify genetic loci closely associated with resistance to this pathogen for developing resistant cultivars. Hence, genomic regions responsible for SB resistance were searched using a wheat association mapping initiative (WAMI) panel involving 287 spring wheat genotypes of different origin. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) was performed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from a custom 90 K wheat SNP array. A mixed linear model (MLM) was used for assessing the association of SNP markers with spot blotch resistance in three consecutive years. Three traits were measured: incubation period, lesion number and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Significant SNP markers were found linked to five, six and four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for incubation period, lesion number and AUDPC respectively. They were detected on 11 different chromosomes: 1A, 1B, 1D, 4A, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A, 7B with marker R2 range of 0.083 to 0.11. The greatest number of significant SNP-markers was found for lesion number and AUDPC on chromosome 6B and 5B, respectively, representing a better coverage of B-genome by SNPs. On the other hand, the most significant and largest SNP markers for incubation period were detected on 6A and 4A chromosomes indicating that this trait is associated with the A-genome of wheat. Although, QTLs for spot blotch resistance have been reported in wheat on these same chromosomes, the association of incubation period and lesion number with SB resistance has not been reported in previous studies. The panel exhibits considerable variation for SB resistance and also provides a good scope of marker-assisted selection using the identified SNP markers linked to resistant QTLs."
