The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely used to precisely edit plant genomes recently. In plants, the first report about the CRISPR/Cas9 system involved <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], followed by reports of its use in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], sorghum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], watermelon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], grape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has developed rapidly and is regarded as a promising method for crop improvement. Transgenic plants with high mutation frequency in the targeted genes can be obtained by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the mutations can be inherited in the next generation stably.</p><p id="Par5">Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most widely grown crops in the world and a major component of the human diet. It has a large (17 Gb), complex polyploid genome with a high proportion of repetitive sequences (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%). These genomic traits create challenges for genetic and functional analyses in wheat. There are only a few reports of using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in common wheat. For example, the <italic>TaMLO</italic> mutants obtained by the CRISPR/Cas9 system show broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew. Transgenic wheat plants with mutations in the <italic>TaMLO-A1</italic> gene were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Genes were edited in hexaploid bread wheat and tetraploid durum wheat, and mutants were generated with no detectable transgenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate <italic>Taedr1</italic> wheat plants by simultaneous modification of the three homoeologs of wheat <italic>EDR1</italic>, and the <italic>Taedr1</italic> plants were resistant to powdery mildew and did not show mildew-induced cell death. The amount of &#x003b1;-gliadins in the seed kernel can be efficiently reduced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, providing bread and durum wheat lines with reduced immunoreactivity for gluten-intolerant consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Because the genetic transformation of wheat is difficult, the above studies of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in wheat all used the biolistic transformation method. However, multiple-copy insertions can be produced by using the biolistic particle delivery method. It could also cause higher expression levels of the sgRNA and Cas9 protein. However, the <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated method usually shows a higher single-site insertion frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Such transgene insertions should be easier to locate in the plant genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, genetic analysis would be easier to carry out in the progeny of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transgenic plants.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we report gene targeting of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in common wheat. Three target genes, the <italic>Pinb</italic> gene, granule-bound starch synthase gene (GBSS or waxy) and <italic>DA1</italic> gene, were selected. In common wheat, puroindoline a (<italic>Pina</italic>) and puroindoline b (<italic>Pinb)</italic> were the two major genes controlling grain hardness. It was known that a lack of <italic>Pina</italic> or a mutation in <italic>Pinb</italic> would cause wheat endosperm to be hard texture. In common wheat, the <italic>Pinb</italic> gene is located on chromosome 5DS. The starch composition of the grain has an important influence on wheat flour quality. Amylose is synthesized by granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS or waxy). In common wheat, <italic>waxy</italic> for each genome is encoded by <italic>Wx-A1, Wx-B1</italic> and <italic>Wx-D1</italic> located on chromosomes 7AS, 4AL (translocated from the original locus on 7BS) and 7DS, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The variants of wheat waxy proteins (Wx-A1, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1) have been used to determine the effect of waxy protein deficiencies on amylase content and starch pasting properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, the frequencies of variation at the <italic>waxy</italic> locus are relatively low in modern wheat cultivars. DA1 is a ubiquitin receptor that functions as a negative regulator in seed and organ size control by restricting the period of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The genome-edited wheat lines with <italic>DA1</italic> loss of function could be used to increase wheat yield and thousand-kernel weight. Thus, the <italic>Pinb</italic>, <italic>waxy</italic> and <italic>DA1</italic> genes offer potential for manipulating grain quality and size-related traits.</p><p id="Par8">In this paper, we reported that the CRISPR/Cas9 system could efficiently conduct gene targeting in common wheat by <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated stable transformation. The gene targeting application of the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system could become a promising biotechnology strategy for functional gene studies and facilitate the breeding efficiency of common wheat and other major crops.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="Par9">The TaU6 (GenBank accession number: X63066.1) and TaU3 (GenBank accession number: X63065.1) promoters were synthesized and cloned into the pYPQ131D and pYPQ132C vectors to generate the pYPQ131D-TaU6 and pYPQ132C-TaU3 plasmids, respectively.

Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most important crops in the world and has a complex genome consisting of three different genomes: A, B, and D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The hexaploid structure of the wheat genome means that the investigation and optimization of the genome editing system is a challenging research objective. In common wheat, this technique has been shown to be effective in both protoplasts and transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the reported transformations of transgenic wheat plants with the CRISPR/Cas9 system have used biolistic-mediated methods. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated and biolistic (gene gun)-mediated methods are two major and effective transformation methods. Compared to the biolistic method, the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation is more popular, because it not only usually inserts single or few copies of transgenes in plants but also does not require an expensive particle gun apparatus and supplies. In the present study, we first verified the targeting efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 via protoplast transfection in vivo and then proceeded to generate transgenic wheat plants by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. This study is an application of targeted mutagenesis with CRISPR/Cas9 in wheat by the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated method.</p><p id="Par24">The wheat protoplast transient expression system is an effective and simple method to evaluate the gene editing capacity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In this study, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to three genes: <italic>Pinb, waxy</italic> and <italic>DA1</italic>. Seven target sites of these three genes were chosen to construct expression vectors. The targeted mutagenesis caused by the CRISPR/Cas9 constructs was confirmed by Illumina sequencing. The transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 was detected in wheat protoplasts successfully. Combination of these results showed that the mutation efficiency of <italic>DA1</italic>-gR1 was the highest (6.8%) compared to the other targets (1.27&#x02013;4.57%). The difference may be due to the location sites and GC contents of the chosen sgRNAs. The mutation efficiency in our study was lower than those in other reports. In the report of wheat mutagenesis via CRISPR/Cas9 by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] in wheat protoplasts, the mutation efficiency for <italic>TaDREB2</italic> was 6.7%, while that for <italic>TaERF3</italic> was 10.2%. In addition, in maize mutagenesis via CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the <italic>ZmIPK</italic> gene, one gRNA achieved 16.4% mutation frequency, and that of the other gRNA was 19.1% in mesophyll protoplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A higher efficiency of 40.7&#x02013;52.0% was achieved in watermelon protoplast cells, while 38.5% was found in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> protoplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The low editing efficiency in this study might be due to the large and complex genome of wheat and the fragile nature of wheat protoplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The choice of targeting sites is the critical step in using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. It has been reported that the GC content of the sgRNA targeting sequence is important for the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, the sgRNAs had a range of GC% content of 27&#x02013;76%; those having a higher GC% content, such as <italic>waxy</italic>-gR2 (76%), did not show a higher editing efficiency (2.56%), and those having a lower GC% content (<italic>Pinb</italic>-gR1 with 27%) had an editing efficiency of 4.57% (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">The mutation types and frequencies may have relationships with a variety of factors. The main factors may be the CRISPR/Cas9 construct transformation method, which could cause different transgene copy numbers. The transformation efficiency in most wheat cultivars was lower than that in other crops. Successful and efficient T-DNA insertion by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation has been achieved in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In this study, transgenic plants could be obtained in three months with transformation efficiencies up to 80%.

In addition, the mutation efficiency reached 54.17%, much higher than the 5.6% previously reported in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

There is still a high possibility of off-target mutations in wheat because of its complex polyploid genome structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The genome editing specificity may decrease particularly for genes that possess high copy numbers in several genomic locations. In this study, transgenic T0 plants of the <italic>DA1</italic> gene showed successful editing in the A and B genomes, but not in the D genome. There is a mismatch between the A, B genome and the D genome. The one mismatch of the D genome maybe the main result of not editing the D allele. This just illustrates the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper from another aspect. Furthermore, there were no off-target mutations found in the highly homologous sequences.</p><p id="Par27">Because of the large and complex genome of wheat, the detection method of transgenic mutagenesis was relatively labour-intensive. Wheat has three different genomes: A, B, and D. Therefore, the detection method becomes an important issue. For the PCR-RE assay, it was necessary to design specific primers to distinguish the A, B and D genomes, and an appropriate restriction enzyme was also needed. However, it was too difficult and time-consuming to design and verify specific primers to distinguish the A, B and D genomes. In addition, the target sequence was not necessarily suitable for the selection of a restriction enzyme. In our study, one of the most important reasons to choose the <italic>DA1</italic> gene for transgenic analysis was that specific primers for the A, B and D genomes had been designed and found to work well in a previous gene function analysis. Therefore, Illumina sequencing was certainly considered in the detection of transgenic wheat mutations.</p><p id="Par28">The application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system would be an important part of crop improvement.

Our results confirmed that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used as a promising tool for facilitating wheat breeding. In addition, it still requires further investigation of inheritance in the mutated transgenic lines and the relationship between the mutation types and the target genes.

The continuous expressing Cas9 gene could produce more abundant mutation types in the transgenic plants and their progeny. Transgenes (Cas9, sgRNA, and so on) can be eliminated from wheat genomes following screening of segregating populations. This segregation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenes from mutations of interest can result in non-transgenic mutant plant progeny.
