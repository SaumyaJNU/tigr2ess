Here we report a detailed characterisation of the thermal degradation and fire properties of fungal mycelium and mycelium-biomass composites. Measurements and analyses are carried out on key parameters such as decomposition temperatures, residual char, and gases evolved during pyrolysis. Pyrolysis flow combustion calorimetry (PCFC) evaluations reveal that the corresponding combustion propensity of mycelium is significantly lower compared to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polylactic acid (PLA), indicating that they are noticeably less prone to ignition and flaming combustion, and therefore safer to use. The hyphal diameters of mycelium decrease following pyrolysis. Cone calorimetry testing results show that the presence of mycelium has a positive influence on the fire reaction properties of wheat grains. This improvement is attributable to the relatively higher charring tendency of mycelium compared to wheat grain, which reduces the heat release rate (HRR) by acting as a thermal insulator and by limiting the supply of combustible gases to the flame front. The mycelium growth time has been found to yield no significant improvements in the fire properties of mycelium-wheat grain composites.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LP140100605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>Tanmay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A new class of composite materials can be made by growing mycelium on various types of biomass, and the resultant composites have recently received significant attention due to their low density and biodegradable properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Mycelium is the vegetative growth of filamentous fungi, comprising of a network of micro-filaments with diameters ranging between 1 and 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;m, depending on the type of species and growth environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Mycelium grows on organic substrates through apical tip expansion of hyphae from a spore or inoculum, under ambient conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The hyphal colonies interact randomly through hyphal fusion (anastomosis) to form a fibre network structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which acts as a natural self-assembling glue to bind the substrates and form a composite material. The key incentives for the use of mycelium composites are their low cost, low environmental impact and carbon footprint, low density, reduced energy consumption and most importantly, their biodegradability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Mycelium composites are currently being used in non-structural applications (e.g. packaging and insulation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although the mechanical properties of mycelium composites based on biomass are inferior to those of conventional engineered (glass or carbon fibre) composites, advanced processing techniques have enabled their use in semi-structural applications (e.g. furniture, decking, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the wide variety of substrates on which mycelium grows combined with advanced processing techniques provides manufacturers with new opportunities to customize the material to meet specific requirements (e.g. impact resistance, thermal and acoustic insulation, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Much of the potential applications of mycelium-based composites are intended for high fire prone environments (e.g. packaging and building insulation). However, very little is known about the thermal degradation and fire properties of mycelium and its composites. To meet the stringent fire safety regulations, it is imperative to characterize the flame-retardant properties of mycelium and mycelium composites. The heat, smoke and gases released by a burning composite can also make fire-fighting extremely hazardous and increase the likelihood of serious injury and death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Large quantities of organic matter present in mycelium composites can act as a fuel source and may escalate the fire risk by shortening the ignition time, increasing heat release and other fire risk factors such as flame spread and smoke toxicity, although these are yet to be quantified. These issues and the effect of incubation period (growth time), which controls the relative mycelial mass, on the fire properties of mycelium composites need to be thoroughly quantified to enable wide practical applications.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we investigate the thermal degradation properties and subsequent changes in the morphological and chemical structure of mycelium. A single mycelium species (<italic>Trametes versicolor</italic>) was selected in this study based on its growth kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and its availability. Parameters such as the onset of decomposition, residual char, evolved gases and heat release were measured. Changes to the physical structure, reduction in hyphal diameters and chemical composition following pyrolysis were investigated to gain an in-depth understanding of the thermal degradation and decomposition mechanisms. Also investigated is the effect of incubation period (growth time) for composites incorporating an organic substrate on their respective fire properties. The results from this first study provide new understanding and quantitative data on the fire safety of mycelium composites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Experimental Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mycelium Composite Preparation</title><p id="Par5">Fungal inoculum of the commonly used species (<italic>T. versicolor</italic>) was purchased from New Generation Mushroom Supplies Pty.

A fixed amount (25&#x02009;wt%) of fungal inoculum was then mixed with the substrate using a sterilised blender. Inoculum content lower than 25&#x02009;wt% resulted in longer growth times and increased the risk of contamination by other competing microbial species.

The FTIR spectra (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) indicated mostly water being released up to 150&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

FTIR analysis of the gases evolved showed that the mass loss in the second stage is accompanied by the release of a multi-component volatile mixture mainly composed of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The release of non-flammable gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O is a critical finding since these gases may hinder flaming combustion by diluting the concentration of flammable gases evolved, thereby improving the fire performance. The FTIR profiles of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O reached their peak values at approximately 350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Moreover, absorbance peaks between 2000 and 2250&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> show the presence of CO in the gaseous products, although the peak intensities are relatively low compared to those of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par15">To further investigate secondary products during the thermal decomposition of mycelium, the evolved gases were also analysed using GCMS sampling of the volatiles evolved from the TGA at 300&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The gas chromatogram as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, revealed the presence of several other organic species, many of which were aromatic in nature. The GCMS system was calibrated to identify gases between 45&#x02013;450 atomic mass units (AMU) and hence could not identify low molecular weight gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The wide variety and complex nature of compounds in mycelium made it difficult to identify all the gaseous products with high accuracy and hence, only products with a database match probability of greater than 60% are reported and listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Evidence for the presence of disulphide, dimethyl and heptasiloxane, hexadecamethyl- as volatile compounds released during decomposition of mycelium is supported through the detection of sulphur and silicon in the residual char via EDS measurements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). No silicon was detected in the residue following decomposition, thereby suggesting its evolution in the gaseous phase. Likewise, a reduction to the carbon/sulphur peak intensity ratio in the residual char also suggests that sulphur derivatives may have been released as a gaseous product. The third and final decomposition stage (450&#x02013;600&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) involves further degradation of the primary residual char during which the chemical constituents have been completely reduced, resulting in the production of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and the consequent formation of a carbonaceous char residue. The carbon residue is expected to be fully amorphous due to the relatively low heating temperatures (&#x0003c;1000&#x02009;&#x000b0;C without catalyst) in comparison to graphitizing temperature greater than 1400&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, the HRR profiles for all four samples are similar, with a rapid increase following ignition to reach an initial peak value. However, the peak heat release rate, which is considered a critical property controlling the maximum temperature and flame spread rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> was marginally higher (<italic>ca</italic>. 10%) for the 0-d sample (200&#x02009;kW/m<sup>2</sup>) relative to that of composites grown for 6, 12 and 18 d (180&#x02009;kW/m<sup>2</sup>).

The hyphal density in the core was significantly lower than at the surface, with negligible differences observed as a function of growth periods. The lower hyphal densities in the core can be attributed to the reduced oxygen diffusion into the bulk of the composite, an essential ingredient for mycelial growth. TGA performed on mycelium and wheat grain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) showed that mycelium starts to decompose at relatively lower temperatures compared to the wheat grain.

The relatively higher mass retention for the 6, 12 and 18-d samples was also confirmed by the cone calorimetry results and is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>. The presence of a surface char layer reduces the heat release by acting as a thermal insulator and by limiting the supply of combustible gases and oxygen to the flame front. Following the initial peak, the HRR drops rapidly due to the emergence of a temporary thermally-protective carbonaceous char layer resulting from the thermal degradation of mycelium. However, with continued thermal exposure, the temporary char may degrade thereby exposing the underlying materials and resulting in a second HRR peak event. The absence of mycelium in the 0-d sample meant that the flaming combustion process was uninhibited resulting in a relatively higher second peak HRR value in comparison to the mycelium-coated samples.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Cross section of the mycelium-wheat composite showing the differences in hyphal density at the surface and the core.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_36032_Fig7_HTML" id="d29e1132"/></fig><fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) TGA &#x02013; mass loss curves for mycelium and wheat grain tested at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min under nitrogen and (<bold>b</bold>) mass loss data for composites grown for 0, 6, 12 and 18 d obtained from cone calorimetry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_36032_Fig8_HTML" id="d29e1147"/></fig></p><p id="Par26">The fire reaction properties of mycelium composites grown for 6, 12 and 18 d were similar.

Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the growth time has no discernible effect on the thermal degradation characteristics of mycelium. FTIR and GCMS analysis have identified the complex thermal degradation patterns accompanied by the release of multiple flammable and non-flammable gaseous products. The fibrous structure of mycelium is retained following pyrolysis, albeit with a reduction in its diameter. The fire reaction properties of mycelium have found to be superior to other competing thermoplastic polymers (PMMA and PLA) due to its tendency to form relatively higher char yields. The presence of mycelium is responsible for an improvement in the fire reaction properties of wheat grains. However, beyond 6 d, the growth time has been found to have no significant effect on the fire reaction properties of mycelium-wheat grain composites. Mycelium has been found to possess certain flame-retardant properties (e.g. high char residue and release of water vapour) and could be used as an economical, sustainable and fire-safer alternative to synthetic polymers for binding matrices.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
