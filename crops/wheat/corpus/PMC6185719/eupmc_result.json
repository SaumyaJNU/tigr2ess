    "The adaptations of root growth and rhizosphere processes for soil phosphorus (P) acquisition have been investigated intensively in wheat (Triticum aestivum). However, only a few studies paid attention to these responses to shoot P status. This study aimed at investigating the responses of root morphology and P-mobilizing exudation to increasing shoot P concentration. A broad range of wheat shoot P concentrations (1.0-7.1 mg per g dry weight) was set up with 11 rates of P supply: 0-1200 mg P per kg soil. Root morphology and exudation parameters were measured after 37 days of plant growth. Shoot dry biomass reached a maximum when shoot P concentration was 4.63 mg per g dry weight. The maximum shoot P concentration for total root length, specific root length and the proportion of fine root (diameter â‰¤ 0.2 mm) length to total root length was 3 mg per g dry weight. Rhizosphere acidification was positively correlated with shoot P concentration when this was <5 mg per g dry weight. Shoot P concentration did not change acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere. Citrate concentration in the rhizosphere was suppressed by increasing shoot P concentration. In contrast, malate concentration in the rhizosphere showed a positive correlation with shoot P concentration. In conclusion, wheat root morphological and P-mobilizing exudation traits showed different behaviours with increasing P deficiency stress. Maintaining root biomass and length is the major strategy rather than root exudation for wheat to cope with extreme P deficiency."
