Recent whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 67 rice accessions recovered 10,872 novel genes. Comparison of the genetic architecture among divergent populations or between crops and wild relatives is essential for obtaining functional components determining crucial traits. However, many major crops have gigabase-scale genomes, which are not well-suited to WGS. Existing cost-effective sequencing approaches including re-sequencing, exome-sequencing and restriction enzyme-based methods all have difficulty in obtaining long novel genomic sequences from highly divergent population with large genome size. The present study presented a reference-independent core genome targeted sequencing approach, CGT-seq, which employed epigenomic information from both active and repressive epigenetic marks to guide the assembly of the core genome mainly composed of promoter and intragenic regions. This method was relatively easily implemented, and displayed high sensitivity and specificity for capturing the core genome of bread wheat. 95% intragenic and 89% promoter region from wheat were covered by CGT-seq read. We further demonstrated in rice that CGT-seq captured hundreds of novel genes and regulatory sequences from a previously unsequenced ecotype. Together, with specific enrichment and sequencing of regions within and nearby genes, CGT-seq is a time- and resource-effective approach to profiling functionally relevant regions in sequenced and non-sequenced populations with large genomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chinese Academy of Sciences</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002367</named-content></funding-source><award-id>XDA08020102</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31570319</award-id><award-id>31770285</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Comparing to the relatively low polymorphism in humans, which is one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) per 1000&#x02013;2000 bases on average (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the genetic diversity in plants is remarkably high (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 67 rice accessions lead to the identification of 10 872 novel genes different from the reference genome (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); read-depth analysis of WGS data from 103 inbred maize lines revealed that 90% of 10-kb windows showed at least 2-fold variation in read depth (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This high genetic diversity in plants provides valuable resources for genetic manipulation to achieve desired traits, and it is essential to pinpoint the genetic component determining the traits. The fundamental approach is to make comprehensive comparison of the genetic architecture among divergent population with varied phenotypes or between cultivated species with wild relatives. WGS accelerated profiling of a full spectrum of genetic variation, and revolutionized approaches to molecular genetics, plant breeding, population and evolutionary genetics (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, both whole-genome doubling (WGD) (i.e. polyploidy) and TE-driven genomic expansion are prevalent in plant, resulting in some extremely large and complex genomes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) has an allohexaploid (AABBDD) genome around 17 Gb in size (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Genome sequences of the most widely cultivated barley, cotton, maize, peanut and soybean varieties are all on a gigabase-scale and not well-suited to WGS of individuals at the population scale. Given that large proportion of the genomes are composed of repeat-rich and non-informative sequences, not every base needs to be sequenced. Multiple cost-effective alternatives were developed, but generally have limitations in identifying novel gene and regulatory sequences from divergent population or unsequenced species.</p><p>For organisms without a reference genome, restriction-enzyme based methods&#x02014;for example, restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq)&#x02014;are typically used to identify variations flanking restriction sites. However, only short fragments in the vicinity of restriction site are recovered. And when the genome is large, sequencing reads from this method are mostly in repetitive regions (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Also, the genetic diversity associated with polymorphism in restriction sites tends to be underestimated. This becomes more pronounced when polymorphism is high (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In some cases, RNA-seq was applied for genotyping of unsequenced organisms (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). One typical example is the bulk segregant RNA-seq (BSR) developed for gene mapping in populations without genetic markers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, comparison of RNA-seq data in unsequenced population is challenging as differences in splicing, gene expression and allele-specific expression add another source of variation to the allele counts (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For well-sequenced species, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is a popular cost-effective alternative approach. It captures the highly interpretable coding region and reduces the sequencing space (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref>). However, the production of a high-quality probes requires a substantial investment of resource, including the probe design, synthesis, infrastructure and personnel expertise (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, the markers are specific to the reference genome (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For population considerably divergent from the reference, WES and even whole genome re-sequencing may miss important genetic variations, novel genes and regulatory sequences determining phenotypic difference. This issue is more apparent when comparing non-sequenced wild species to trace domestication pathways, or for evolutionary and ecological studies. Also, non-coding sequences containing important regulatory information could not be captured by WES.</p><p>Thus, an ideal alternative approach for studies in divergent population and wild species would be to directly capture the regulatory and coding sequences. Inspired by the fact that promoter and gene body regions are enriched for specific types of epigenetic marks, we developed core genome targeted sequencing (CGT-seq). The principal goal was to enable specific capturing and re-sequencing of the core genome, composed of gene body and promoter regions, through enrichment of epigenetic marks preferentially located surrounding genes. This method is independent of any prior sequence information, thus avoiding the reference bias, and has the potential to be broadly applicable to both sequenced and unsequenced organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) genotype &#x02018;Chinese Spring&#x02019; (&#x02018;CS&#x02019;) was used.

ChIP-seq was performed for the major epigenetic marks surrounding genes in monocot model plant rice. Different modifications preferentially locate in different genic regions and mark different sets of genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). H3K4me3 tends to be present surrounding transcription start site (TSS), while other modifications occur mostly in the gene body. Similar profiles were observed in other monocot (wheat and maize) and dicot (Arabidopsis and tree cotton) plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>), indicating the binding profiles are relatively conserved in higher plants. H3K27me3 preferentially marks repressed genes, while other modifications are associated with active expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figures S2 and S3</xref>). Of 30 808 high confidence rice genes, 89% are enriched for at least one of these modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S2B</xref>). Combinations of these marks provide useful resources for capturing both intragenic and regulatory sequences of genes with a broad range of expression levels. Accordingly, we designed an experimental and computational pipeline for re-construction of the core genome (pipeline shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Briefly, ChIP-seq of different marks was performed, sequencing reads of each modification were assembled and further merged. Next, reads from all modifications were mapped to the assembled contigs derived from the previous step, and paired sequencing reads were used to join contigs into scaffolds. All reads were re-mapped to the scaffolds, gaps were filled and scaffolds were extended (see Materials and Methods). All scripts are available on CGT-seq website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/zhanglab/cgt-seq/index.htm">http://bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/zhanglab/cgt-seq/index.htm</ext-link>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Design of CGT-seq.

A total of 2,874,277 scaffolds were assembled from 100 Gb of sequencing reads (50 Gb from each modification), and 93% of the assembled scaffolds could be mapped with high accuracy to the reference genome of bread wheat (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0) (see Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>).

The NAC transcription factor no apical meristem (NAM) plays crucial role in controlling grain nutrient content (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Here, CGT-seq successfully assembled both promoter and gene body regions of the homologous genes from A, B and D genomes with 100% identity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). The essential parameters for measuring the performance of targeted sequencing include sensitivity and specificity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Sensitivity is the percentage of the expected target bases that are represented by at least one of the captured reads. 95% bases from gene body and 89% bases from promoter region could be covered by at least one sequencing reads (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). For well-sequenced species, the genetic architecture could be directly profiled from the mapping result. For organisms with genome unknown or plant variety whose sequence is highly divergent from the reference genome, assembly is recommended. The length of each gene covered by assembled scaffolds was calculated. The assembled scaffolds could cover &#x02265; 1 kb genic regions surrounding over 55% of annotated genes, and &#x02265; 500 bp genic regions surrounding over 75% genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). We next calculated the sequencing depth of different genomic regions recovered by CGT-seq. The promoter and intragenic regions displayed median coverage of 24&#x02013;67-fold, while the intergenic regions only have 14-fold coverage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Specificity is the percentage of scaffolds that map to the intended targets. 70% H3K4me3 scaffolds and 27% H3K27me3 scaffolds localized within or nearby genes, which show 5.4-fold and 2.0-fold enrichment relative to genomic background. For H3K4me3 captured intergenic sequences based on current version of annotation, 16% could be mapped by RNA-seq reads, significantly higher than the genomic background (1%), indicating the coding potential of these regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). On the other hand, the fraction of intergenic TEs and repetitive sequences, majority of which localized in heterochromatin and are supposed to have no direct role in gene activity, is 2.2-times lower in H3K4me3 captured regions as compared to the genomic background. Together, CGT-seq displayed high sensitivity and specificity for enrichment of core genome regions.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Performance of CGT-seq.

Both WES and CGT-seq aim to enrich genic regions to reduce sequencing space. For studies focusing on coding regions in well-sequenced varieties, the specificity and sensitivity of CGT-seq is not necessarily superior than WES, except that CGT-seq is relatively easily implemented. However, the following features of CGT-seq make it particularly appealing for divergent populations, wild species and non-model organisms lacking reference genomes. Firstly, CGT-seq-based assembly is independent of any prior reference information. Secondly, the regulatory region and gene structure could be recovered, facilitating gene cloning, exploration of regulatory mechanism and identification of casual variation. Thirdly, the longer assembled sequence ensures more accurate identification of SNVs and novel regulatory or genic regions. CGT-seq also overcomes the issues presented in previous restriction-enzyme based approach, which always results in short and functionally irrelevant sequences when applied to large-genome organisms, and is incapable of characterizing loci with high polymorphism.</p><p>Other methodologies for removing repetitive sequences in order to enrich for genic regions were proposed previously. Typical example includes the integration of methylation filtering and high C<sub>0</sub>t (HC) selection for enrichment of gene-coding sequences in maize by removing highly methylated and repetitive regions before sequencing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42&#x02013;44</xref>). Both reduced representation strategies are highly cost-effective. However, the application of methylation filtration is limited by the fact that in addition to transposon and repetitive regions, genebody of most well-studied plant species are normally hyper-methylated (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The prevalent usage of high C<sub>0</sub>t analysis is restricted by the requirement of deep understanding of kinetics (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S4</xref> summarized the advantages and limitations of CGT-seq and some major reduced representation methods.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-2"><title>Coverage of CGT-seq and potential improvement</title><p>We demonstrated in bread wheat that 95% intragenic and 89% promoter regions were covered by CGT-seq read (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and the assembly of CGT-seq read could recover &#x0003e;500 bp regions from &#x0003e;75% genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Despite that CGT-seq captured regions did not cover the whole genic regions for most genes, the captured regions are highly functional relevant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In addition, with more genetic markers, longer sequencing reads and mate-pair sequence information, the length and coverage of CGT-seq are expected to be further improved.</p><p>Even if the casual region is not recovered, CGT-seq provides high density of long sequences and genetic markers surrounding functional regions with high accuracy. Given that map-based cloning in plant populations with no genetic markers is still time- and labor- consuming, combination of high quality and high density of genetic markers recovered by CGT-seq and bulked segregant analysis would facilitate rapid and efficient gene mapping in populations with no genetic markers.</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-3"><title>Cost and uniformity of CGT-seq</title><p>Seven parameters were proposed to assess the performance of target-enrichment strategies: (i) sensitivity; (ii) specificity; (iii) uniformity of the read coverage across target regions; (iv) reproducibility of results obtained from replicate experiments; (v) cost; (vi) ease of use and (vii) amount of DNA required per experiment. We showed that CGT-seq had high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. The sequencing space and cost is substantially reduced by specific enrichment of the core genome, which account for &#x0003c; 10% of the genome for majority of organisms. For example, to get 10X genomic coverage in bread wheat, 170 Gb re-sequencing reads are required. To ensure a similar coverage surrounding captured genes using CGT-seq, 40 Gb sequencing reads are sufficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>), saving the cost for 130 Gb sequencing reads, which is approximately $1755 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). The extra ChIP step implemented in CGT-seq only costs about $100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). Thus, the total cost of CGT-seq is lower than re-sequencing by approximately one order of magnitude. Importantly, re-sequencing is dependent on a well-assembled reference genome, while CGT-seq is reference independent, and has the potential to be broadly applied. Implementation of the method is also practical. ChIP has gradually become a routine technique, and high-efficiency commercial antibodies to the major epigenetic modifications are readily available. In terms of the amount of DNA required, one ChIP experiment requires &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10 g of fresh material. This sample size is easy to obtain from economically important plants, which are generally in good supply.</p><p>In terms of uniformity, ChIP-seq read from one mark may suffer from the bias caused by the dynamic range of read distribution surrounding genes. However, by combination of reads from histone modifications preferentially marks both active (e.g. H3K4me3) and repressive (e.g. H3K27me3) genes, this bias could be sufficiently reduced. If further decrease of the prevalence of abundant reads is desired, duplex-specific thermostable nuclease (DSN) enzyme-based normalization is recommended, which is widely used for cDNA library normalization to reduce abundant DNA molecules while preserving less-abundant ones (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that DSN normalized library help to increase the range of targeted regions recovered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S8</xref>). We further asked whether the markers have preferential localization surrounding CpG island (CGI) promoters, which is closely associated with epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The distribution of rice histone markers employed in this study surrounding CGI and non-CGI promoters were calculated, and no apparent preferential localization was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC4-4"><title>Selection of epigenetic markers and generalization of CGT-seq to other species</title><p>The epigenetic machineries regulating epigenetic marks are generally ancient (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The profiles of these modifications surrounding genes are similar in both monocot plants (rice, wheat and maize) and dicot plants (Arabidopsis and tree cotton) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). For all these species, the regulatory role of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are conserved, with H3K4me3 positively correlated with gene activity, and H3K27me3 negatively correlated with gene activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figures S2 and S3</xref>), which is also the case in mammalian cells (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Thus, CGT-seq is potentially of wide application. Among these modifications, H3K4me3 is the top enriched marker surrounding TSS for all these species. In addition, given that the antibody to the active H3K4me3 displayed the highest ChIP efficiency in our experiment, i.e. quantity of precipitated DNA by the same amount of antibody, employment of this mark for CGT-seq should be the most cost-effective. If more genes with low expression or no expression need to be captured, antibody to H3K27me3 could be further applied. If longer sequences from genic region are expected, the addition of antibodies to H3K36me3, H3K27ac or H3K4me1 are recommended (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Figure S10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="SEC5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, the present study developed a reference-independent approach, CGT-seq, which allows enrichment and extensive sequencing of the core genome mainly composed of promoter and intragenic regions.
