    "Plants and pathogenic microbes are engaged in constant attacks and counterattacks at the interface of the interacting organisms. Much of the molecular warfare involves cross-kingdom trafficking of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites that act as toxins, inhibitors, lytic enzymes, and signaling molecules. How various molecules are transported across the boundaries of plants and pathogens has remained largely unknown until now. Extracellular vesicles have emerged as likely carriers of molecular ammunition for both plants and pathogens. Recent advances are beginning to show how extracellular vesicles serve as powerful vehicles that transfer small RNAs from plants to fungal cells to diminish pathogen virulence and from fungi to plant cells to dampen host immunity."
