Plant resistance strategies are complicated by the fact that herbivores with different lifestyles are susceptible to different types of defenses. Chewing herbivores, for instance, ingest entire leaf parts and are therefore susceptible to plant toxins that accumulate throughout the leaf (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). By contrast, piercing-sucking herbivores, such as aphids, often feed directly from the phloem and are therefore most susceptible to phloem-specific defenses (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The resulting selection pressure for herbivore-specific deployment of defenses has important consequences for the evolution, physiology, and ecology of plant immunity against herbivores (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p><p>To mount herbivore-specific defense responses, plants have evolved several regulatory mechanisms. Phytohormonal signaling and cross-talk, for instance, allow plants to finely regulate their induced responses (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). In this context, jasmonate (JA) signaling is often associated with induced resistance to chewing herbivores, while salicylate (SA) signaling is associated with resistance to piercing-sucking insects (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). However, the picture is likely more complex, as plants use a variety of hormones to form signaling networks that allow for targeted responses against chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>).</p><p>Apart from hormonal cross-talk, plants can also use secondary metabolites as defensive switches. In maize, the benzoxazinoid 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose (DIMBOA-Glc) and its aglucone DIMBOA are positive regulators of callose induction and are associated with increased aphid resistance (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>), while the DIMBOA-Glc <italic>O</italic>-methylation product 2-(2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one)-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose (HDMBOA-Glc) acts as a feeding deterrent against both aphids and chewing herbivores in vitro (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Upon caterpillar attack, maize plants transform DIMBOA-Glc into HDMBOA-Glc by up-regulating the transcription of three closely related <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferases (OMTs) (ZmBx10&#x02013;ZmBx12) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). By contrast, upon aphid attack, the aglucone DIMBOA is secreted into the apoplastic space, and DIMBOA-Glc levels remain high (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Maize DIMBOA-Glc OMTs may therefore act as metabolic switches between caterpillar and aphid resistance. However, the relative contributions of DIMBOA-Glc and HDMBOA-Glc to in planta caterpillar resistance remain to be determined.</p><p>Similar to benzoxazinoids in grasses, glucosinolates can regulate callose deposition in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>). 4-Hydroxy-indol-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate (4MO-I3M) is necessary and sufficient to induce callose in response to microbe-associated molecular patterns such as the flagellin peptide flg22 (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Callose deposition depends on the myrosinase PENETRATION 2 (PEN2) and may therefore be elicited by 4MO-I3M breakdown products (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Callose deposition upon infection with fungal and oomycete pathogens is still intact in PEN2- and 4MO-I3M&#x02013;deficient mutants, suggesting that 4MO-I3M is not strictly required for induced callose deposition in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Despite their differences, 4MO-I3M and DIMBOA share some structural and biosynthetic similarities, including an aromatic ring bearing an <italic>O</italic>-methoxy group, a glucose moiety and indole as a precursor. Whether the capacity of benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates to regulate callose is conserved across mono- and dicotyledons is unclear (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p><p>A common feature of regulation of herbivore-specific defenses is that these defenses can result in signaling trade-offs. The induction of SA-mediated defenses by piercing-sucking insects, for instance, suppresses JA-dependent volatile defenses against other herbivores (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Furthermore, many early signaling elements, which are required for induced defenses against chewing herbivores, result in susceptibility against piercing-sucking insects (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Whether secondary metabolite switches also result in similar trade-offs is less understood. In maize, caterpillar feeding increases aphid reproduction in some cultivars, and this effect was mapped to the <italic>ZmBx10&#x02013;ZmBx12</italic> locus (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), lending first support to the hypothesis that the caterpillar-induced conversion of DIMBOA-Glc to HDMBOA-Glc reduces aphid resistance.</p><p>While the ecological relevance of herbivore specificity in defense induction is well established, much less is known about the evolution of the underlying mechanisms for that specificity. Analysis of the recent literature suggests that the negative interaction between JA and SA is a conserved trait that was likely already present in the ancestor of angiosperms (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). To what extent secondary metabolite switches are evolutionarily conserved is currently unknown. Some secondary metabolites have evolved independently several times (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). In general, the rapid evolution and variation in plant secondary metabolites (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>) may favor convergent evolution of secondary metabolite switches mediating specific herbivore resistance.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the specificity, functional architecture, and genetic basis of aphid and caterpillar resistance in wheat. On the basis of current knowledge on caterpillar and aphid resistance in maize, we focused on benzoxazinoids as direct and indirect regulators of resistance. The core benzoxazinoid pathway is conserved among different cereals and likely to be of monophyletic origin within the Poaceae (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the induction of HDMBOA-Glc at the expense of DIMBOA-Glc upon caterpillar attack occurs in both wheat and maize (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the switch between aphid and caterpillar resistance should be conserved between the two species as well. To test this hypothesis, we first explored the functional architecture of benzoxazinoid-dependent defense and resistance by overexpressing a maize DIMBOA-Glc OMT in wheat. This approach allowed us to explore the importance of HDMBOA-Glc accumulation for caterpillar resistance in vivo and to quantify the contribution of DIMBOA-Glc methylation to caterpillar-induced aphid susceptibility. To evaluate the specificity of callose regulation by benzoxazinoids, we conducted complementation experiments with benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates in wheat and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Last, we analyzed the genetic architecture of the benzoxazinoid switch by transcriptional profiling, heterologous expression, and genome-based phylogenetic analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Influence of DIMBOA-Glc <italic>O</italic>-methylation on wheat defense</title><p>To explore the role of DIMBOA-Glc <italic>O</italic>-methylation in wheat, we generated transgenic plants harboring the DIMBOA-Glc OMT gene <italic>ZmBx12</italic> from maize under the control of a constitutive maize <italic>UBIQUITIN1</italic> promoter. Experiments were carried out using two T2 homozygous transgenic lines (OeBx12_1 and OeBx12_2), which constitutively expressed <italic>ZmBx12</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Compared with wild-type plants, OeBx12 leaves accumulated high amounts of HDMBOA-Glc at the expense of DIMBOA-Glc and DIMBOA, which were almost entirely depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The HDMBOA-Glc breakdown product MBOA also accumulated in higher amounts in OeBx12 lines, while HMBOA-Glc, which is likely formed from DIMBOA-Glc or DIBOA-Glc, was present in lower concentrations (fig. S1). Levels of the other benzoxazinoids in the leaves did not change significantly, apart from a slight increase in DIM<sub>2</sub>BOA-Glc in one of the OeBx12 lines (fig. S1). Similar patterns were found in phloem sap collected through aphid stylectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). While DIMBOA-Glc and DIMBOA were dominant in the phloem of wild-type plants, OeBx12 lines accumulated high amounts of HDMBOA-Glc at the expense of DIMBOA-Glc and DIMBOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). OeBx12 plants grew similar to their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and accumulated similar amounts of sugars, starch, and soluble protein in their leaves (fig. S1). We also did not find any consistent changes in free amino acids in the leaves and phloem of wild-type and OeBx12 plants (fig. S1). Higher amounts of ferulic acid were observed in OeBx12 plants compared with wild-type plants (fig. S2). Furthermore, OeBx12 plants displayed less callose induction following treatment with the fungal elicitor chitosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and aphid infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Thus, the functional architecture of benzoxazinoid regulation of callose seems to be similar in wheat and maize.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Phenotype of <italic>ZmBx12</italic>-overexpressing wheat lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative (rel.) expression of the maize DIMBOA-Glc OMT <italic>ZmBx12</italic> in wild-type (WT) and <italic>ZmBx12</italic>-overexpressing plants (<italic>n</italic> = 3).

DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc treatments induced significant callose deposition in the leaves of wild-type plants, while HDMBOA-Glc had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Unexpectedly, complementation of OeBx12 plants with DIMBOA or DIMBOA-Glc did not result in any callose induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We devised two hypotheses to explain this result. First, we postulated that the high levels of HDMBOA-Glc in OeBx12 plants may inhibit callose induction. To test this hypothesis, we infused wild-type leaves with combinations of DIMBOA, DIMBOA-Glc, and HDMBOA-Glc. Co-infusion of HDMBOA-Glc did not suppress callose induction by DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). As an alternative hypothesis, we tested whether the infused DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc are rapidly metabolized in OeBx12 lines. Infusion of DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc increased DIMBOA-Glc levels in wild-type plants, but not in OeBx12 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), where levels remained constantly low. The levels of two likely metabolic products, HDMBOA-Glc and MBOA, were not significantly increased in the infiltrated leaves in any of the lines upon DIMBOA or DIMBOA-Glc infiltration (fig. S3). These results suggest that either rapid transformation to yet unidentified, inactive catabolites or rapid transport of HDMBOA-Glc or MBOA into systemic tissues may have prevented the induction of callose by DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc in OeBx12 lines.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Callose suppression through DIMBOA-Glc <italic>O</italic>-methylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Induction of callose in WT and <italic>ZmBx12</italic>-overexpressing lines after infiltration with DIMBOA, DIMBOA-Glc, or HDMBOA-Glc (<italic>n</italic> = 4 to 11).

This study illustrates that a single, herbivory inducible methylation step serves as a switch and trade-off point between aphid and caterpillar resistance in wheat. Unexpectedly, while the core biosynthesis pathway and the functional architecture of the defense switch are similar in wheat and maize, the responsible enzymes have evolved independently from each other. Below, we discuss these results from physiological, ecological, and evolutionary points of view.</p><p>The role of benzoxazinoids, including the methylation of DIMBOA-Glc to HDMBOA-Glc, in plant-herbivore interactions has been studied in detail in maize (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). In vitro experiments with DIMBOA and HDMBOA-Glc suggested that HDMBOA-Glc may be more potent as a feeding deterrent, as it is rapidly deglycosylated and converted into unstable breakdown products (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>), which precludes its detoxification by reglycosylation (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Our results support this hypothesis by showing that the overproduction of HDMBOA-Glc renders plants less attractive and reduces leaf damage by <italic>S. littoralis</italic>. Apparently, HDMBOA-Glc acts as a strong antixenotic rather than an antibiotic, as caterpillar growth was not reduced in the transgenic lines. How caterpillars avoid negative consequences of HDMBOA-Glc on their digestive physiology remains to be determined. The increased levels of ferulic acid in HDMBOA-Glc&#x02013;overproducing lines suggest that other secondary metabolites may be regulated by DIMBOA-Glc <italic>O</italic>-methylation. While the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear, it is possible that the increased levels of other defenses in HDMBOA-Glc&#x02013;overproducing lines may have contributed to the reduction in caterpillar feeding.</p><p>Although HDMBOA-Glc is also toxic to aphids (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>), aphids grow better on maize cultivars with high HDMBOA-Glc levels and low DIMBOA-Glc levels, which coincides with lower callose inducibility in these genotypes (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Together with the fact that caterpillar attack induces HDMBOA-Glc production and depletes DIMBOA-Glc reserves (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>), this led to the hypothesis that caterpillar feeding should induce aphid susceptibility by suppressing callose accumulation (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Our experiments not only confirm this hypothesis but also demonstrate that callose inducibility only partially explains the interaction between <italic>S. littoralis</italic> and <italic>S. avenae</italic> in wheat. Aphid performance was decreased on caterpillar-attacked leaves even in the absence of DIMBOA-Glc depletion, suggesting that other inducible defenses increase aphid resistance. Caterpillar attack leads to substantial transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming of a plant&#x02019;s primary and secondary metabolism (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>), and it is therefore not unusual that physiological changes other than benzoxazinoid-dependent callose deposition contribute to the overall outcome of the interaction between caterpillars and aphids. In maize, genetic mapping revealed substantial variation and multiple quantitative trait loci associated with caterpillar-induced resistance and susceptibility against aphids (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), which may provide a path toward the functional characterization of these additional factors.</p><p>The resistance of wheat to fungal pathogens has been associated with callose deposition (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). In this context, it is unexpected that the suppressed callose inducibility in Oe_Bx12 lines did not affect their resistance to two fungal pathogens. We propose three hypotheses to explain this result. First, it is possible that the fungi are more susceptible to HDMBOA-Glc than DIMBOA-Glc, which may have counterbalanced resistance in the transgenic lines. Second, the higher production of other defenses in HDMBOA-Glc&#x02013;overproducing lines may have offset the effects of reduced callose deposition. Third, the two pathogens may suppress or avoid callose induction. In maize, fungal pathogen attack leads to a marked increase of HDMBOA-Glc levels (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>), and it is possible that such an induction, similar to caterpillar attack, suppresses callose inducibility in wheat and thereby allows the fungus to suppress effective defenses.</p><p>Overall, our experiments and the current literature reveal that the architecture of benzoxazinoid-dependent defense regulation is notably similar in maize and wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In both species, DIMBOA-Glc is generally the dominant constitutively produced benzoxazinoid, and HDMBOA-Glc is strongly induced and becomes dominant upon caterpillar and pathogen attack (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Furthermore, callose deposition is induced by DIMBOA and DIMBOA-Glc, but not by HDMBOA-Glc (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Genetic analyses revealed that the core biosynthetic pathway that converts indole-3-glycerol phosphate to DIBOA-Glc via several intermediate steps is largely conserved between wheat and maize (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). The fact that the DIMBOA-Glc <italic>OMT</italic> genes in wheat and maize are analogs rather than orthologs is an unexpected finding in this context. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the capacity to produce HDMBOA-Glc and to use the DIMBOA-Glc OMT as a regulatory switch between aphid and caterpillar resistance evolved independently in maize and wheat. The functional validation of the wheat DIMBOA-Glc OMT TaBX10 in planta would shed further light on its contribution to HDMBOA-Glc biosynthesis relative to other potential wheat OMTs. Although HDMBOA-Glc has also been found in Job&#x02019;s tears (<italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic>) (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>), nothing is known about HDMBOA-Glc production in the other benzoxazinoid-producing plant species. Investigating and comparing the evolutionary relationships and defense regulation of benzoxazinoids in additional species are exciting prospects of this work.</p><fig id="F6" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Independently evolved <italic>O</italic>-methylation of benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates regulates defense and resistance.</title><p>DIMBOA-Glc is required for callose induction in wheat and maize.

HDMBOA-Glc repels caterpillars, while DIMBOA-Glc reduces aphid growth, most likely by promoting callose formation. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, methylation of the glucosinolate 4OH-I3M by IGMT1 and IGMT2 leads to the formation of 4MO-I3M, which is required for callose deposition in this species. 4MO-I3M increases aphid and pathogen resistance, most likely by promoting callose formation. IGMT1 and IGMT2 are only distantly related to cereal benzoxazinoid OMTs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aat6797-F6"/></fig><p>Comparing callose induction of benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates revealed a high degree of specificity.

Conversely, the glucosinolate-producing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> responds strongly to 4MO-I3M, but not to DIMBOA or DIMBOA-Glc. As expected, the OMTs involved in the production of 4MO-I3M (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>) and HDMBOA-Glc (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>) are only distantly related to each other. Thus, callose regulation by benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> does not proceed via the same mechanism, and it is likely that the two phenomena evolved independently from each other. Glucosinolate hydrolysis is required for callose induction in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), while DIMBOA seems to induce callose in the absence of any measurable increase in known breakdown products. As glucosinolate breakdown products are structurally distinct from benzoxazinoids and their catabolites, they would likely require a different mechanism of perception to be integrated into defense signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible that the signaling cascades elicited by benzoxazinoids and glucosinolate share a common ancestor and diverged since the split of the mono- and dicotyledons 140 Ma ago (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>). A better understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of callose regulation by benzoxazinoids and glucosinolates will be required to disentangle these hypotheses.</p><p>Convergence is an important force in evolution (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>), and plants provide many fascinating examples in this context (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>). Caffeine biosynthesis, for instance, evolved at least five times within the flowering plants, partially by co-opting enzymes with different ancestral functions (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>).

Secondary metabolites may thus allow plants to rapidly and specifically adapt their defense signaling systems to different herbivore and pathogen pressures. The finding that maize and wheat co-opted the same secondary metabolite pathway to specifically regulate defenses against aphids and caterpillars is suggestive of an important adaptive role of this form of herbivore-specific defense regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Note that the numbers of replicates for the individual experiments are provided in the respective figure legends.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant and insect material</title><p>The wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) CYMMIT breeding line Bobwhite SH 98 26 (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>) was used in this study.

Each leaf was infiltrated with 500 &#x003bc;l of 0.2% (w/v) low viscous chitosan (Sigma, USA), which has a molecular weight of approximately 190 kDa. Chitosan was dissolved to 1% in 1% acetic acid and diluted to 0.2% by distilled water. DIMBOA, DIMBOA-Glc, and HDMBOA-Glc were dissolved to 80 &#x003bc;g/ml by 1.96% methanol and 0.04% acetic acid. 4MO-I3M (Phytoplan, Germany) was dissolved to 80 &#x003bc;g/ml by distilled water. Twenty-four hours after infiltration, leaf segments around the infiltration spots (approximately 4 cm<sup>2</sup>) were collected and destained by 96% ethanol to remove chlorophyll. Leaf segments with cell death symptoms were excluded. Destained leaf segments were stained with 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 0.01% aniline blue (Sigma, USA). Callose deposition was observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany), and callose spots were counted by eye. To determine callose deposition induced by aphid feeding, five aphid adults were placed in cages (2-cm diameter) on the leaves of 14-day-old wheat plants. After 7 days, all aphids were removed. Aphid-infested leaf segments were collected from 10 different plants per line. Leaf segment destaining and callose staining were performed as described above. As callose deposition following aphid infestation showed variable shapes and intensity, we first determined the total area of callose per plant (&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) using Digimizer (MedCalc Software, Belgium). We then assessed the intensity of the staining on a relative scale from 1 (weak intensity) to 5 (strong intensity).
