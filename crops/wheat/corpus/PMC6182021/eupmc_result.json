    "Trace elements are essential nutrients for the growth of microorganisms and play an important role in their proliferation. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the optimal C and N sources for large-scale culture of Paenibacillus polymyxa, and to screen trace elements that can promote their proliferation and improve the activity. First, the concentration of Paenibacillus polymyxa Pp-7250, the number of spores were used as evaluation index. It was found that the four trace elements Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ could promote the proliferation of Paenibacillus polymyxa at their optimal concentrations. Next, when using wheat starch as carbon source and soybean meal as nitrogen source, it was most suitable for large-scale culture. Finally, field experiments were carried out, and it was discovered that the combination of four trace elements plus the wheat soybean meal group could significantly improve the disease prevention, growth promotion ability of Pp-7250 and its colonization in ginseng. Moreover, the ability of Pp-7250 to transform ginseng roots and leaf saponins were also significantly improved. The group also affected the rhizosphere bacterial community of ginseng and the number showed a significant promotion or inhibition."
