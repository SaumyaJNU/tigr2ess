Using St genomic DNA from the diploid <italic>Pseudoroegneria strigosa</italic> as a probe and the E genomic DNA from <italic>Th. elongatum</italic> for blocking, Chen et al.

Breeding resistant cultivars is the most effective and economical means to control the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Thus, wheat-<italic>Th. ponticum</italic> partial amphiploids, which contain the complete genomes of wheat but an incomplete genome (a set of chromosomes) of <italic>Th</italic>. <italic>ponticum</italic>, are used as crucial intermediate materials in the transfer of desirable genes from <italic>Th</italic>. <italic>ponticum</italic> to common wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several wheat-<italic>Th. ponticum</italic> amphiploids have been obtained, analyzed and exploited as alien sources of disease resistance in wheat improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In this study, we identified three novel wheat-<italic>Th. ponticum</italic> partial amphiploids with good rust resistance indpendent of stage. These three octoploid <italic>Trititrigia</italic> were developed in the common wheat cultivar YN15 background, and they had good phenotypic characteristics, such as long spikes, advanced fluorescence, and higher cross-compatibility with wheat. Therefore, they could be used as bridge parents to cross with wheat to develop addition, substitution or translocation lines in order to provide new rust resistance germplasms for wheat breeding.</p><p id="Par26">At both stages, YN15 was highly susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust, whereas the three octoploid <italic>Trititrigia</italic> were immune at both stages. This indicated that SN0389, SN0398 and SN0406 possessed a resistant gene to rust that was derived from <italic>Th. ponticum</italic>. An analysis of the mitotic chromosomes showed that SN0389 had 42 wheat chromosomes and 12 <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> chromosomes, while SN0398 and SN0406 had 42 wheat chromosomes and 14 <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> chromosomes. The results indicated that the alien chromosome of SN0389 was 12J<sup>S</sup>. The alien chromosomes in SN0389 and SN0406 were not from a single genome of J<sup>S</sup> or J, and the alien chromosome constitution of SN0398 and SN0406 was 12J<sup>S</sup>&#x02009;+&#x02009;2&#x000a0;J. Since there were 12 or 14 alien chromosomes in these three octoploid <italic>Trititrigia</italic>, it was difficult to deduce which chromosome the rust resistance gene was located on. We had hybridized the amphiploid with YN15, thus try to screen addition lines with different alien chromosomes in the derivative generations. Then it will be easier to identify which alien chromosome carrying the rust resistance gene. As there were lack of specific FISH or GISH signals and specific molecular markers of each chromosomes in <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> now, more work is needed to make that conclusion.</p><p id="Par27">It is generally believed that only euploid amphiploids are genetically stable, while aneuploids often result in the loss of the added alien chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results here show that the chromosome number of SN0389 was 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54, and it only contained 12 alien chromosomes. However, the meiotic studies showed that SN0389 had a regular meiotic behavior after it was self-pollinated for several generations, and its chromosome number was still 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54. Similar phenomena are also observed in partial amphiploid lines obtained from wheat &#x000d7; <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> and wheat &#x000d7; <italic>Th. intermedium</italic> hybridizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, the partial amphiploid BE-1 contains 16 chromosomes derived from <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> and 40 wheat chromosomes, and the substituted wheat chromosome pair, as identified by FISH, was 7D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lines Zhong 1 (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;52) and Zhong 2 (2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54) both contain the complete wheat A, B and D genomes but with 10 and 12 <italic>Th. intermedium</italic> chromosomes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further research on the composition of these alien chromosomes and its compensation effect will be helpful in understanding the genetic relationship between the genome of <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> and wheat as well as be a benefit for transferring valuable traits from <italic>Th</italic>. <italic>ponticum</italic> into wheat.</p><p id="Par28">Using the in situ hybridization pattern of FISH and McGISH, chromosome variations in wheat were also detected. In this study, the structural variations also occurred in chromosomes 1A, 3A, 6A, 2B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 1D and 5D of SN0389, SN0398 and SN0406. The results indicated that during the formation of the partial amphiploids, various intergenomic rearrangements occurred. Some of the chromosome recombinations were caused by introgressed chromosome segments from <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> into common wheat chromosomes, while the introgressed segments were too small to detect by GISH. The other reason for the structural variations in the wheat chromosomes might also be that they were generated by recombination between different wheat chromosomes, such as homeologous chromosome recombination between the A-, B-, and D- genome genomic chromosomes that was interfered by the existence of the <italic>Th. ponticum</italic> chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">Three partial amphiploids with good resistance and different phenotypic traits were obtained in this study. The chromosome composition of the wheat-<italic>Th ponticum</italic> partial amphiploid was studied by means of GISH, McGISH and FISH. As a good source for improving disease resistance, these amphiploids could be used as promising crossing partners in wheat breeding programs, and resistant progenies of this partial amphiploid could be used as rust resistance sources in wheat improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
