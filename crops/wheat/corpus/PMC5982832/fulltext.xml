The objective of this study was to map and characterize the gene(s) for seedling leaf rust resistance in Jagger. The recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of Jagger &#x000d7; &#x02018;2174&#x02019; was inoculated with leaf rust pathogen THBJG and BBBDB, and evaluated for infection type (IT) response. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for THBJG and BBBDB was coincidently mapped to chromosome arm 2AS, and the QTL accounted for 56.6&#x02013;66.2% of total phenotypic variation in infection type (IT) response to THBJG, and 72.1&#x02013;86.9% to BBBDB. The causal gene for resistance to these rust races was mapped to the 2NS segment in Jagger. The 2NS segment was located in a region of approximately 27.8 Mb starting from the telomere of chromosome arm 2AS, based on the sequences of the A genome in tetraploid wheat. The <italic>Lr17a</italic> gene on chromosome arm 2AS was delimited to 3.1 Mb in the genomic region, which was orthologous to the 2NS segment. Therefore, the <italic>Lr37</italic> gene in the 2NS segment can be pyramided with other effective resistance genes, rather than <italic>Lr17a</italic> in wheat, to improve resistance to rust diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>leaf rust</kwd><kwd><italic>Lr37</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Lr17</italic></kwd><kwd>quantitative trait loci (QTL)</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The hard red winter wheat variety Jagger (KS84W85/Stephens) (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, 2<italic>n</italic> = 6&#x000d7;=42, AABBDD) has been widely grown in the Great Plains region of the U.S. since its release in 1996.

The parental lines and the RILs were grown in segmented trays with 8-10 seed of a single wheat line in each segment in a greenhouse at 20-23&#x000b0; and fertilized with 20-20-20 NPK solution 7 days after planting. At the two-leaf stage, the seedlings were inoculated with a single race of <italic>P. triticina</italic> using a suspension of urediniospores in Soltrol 170 (Phillips Petroleum, Bartlesville, OK) mineral oil. After inoculation the plants were dried for 1 hr, and then placed in a dew chamber overnight at 18&#x000b0;.

The 2NS translocation in Jagger was determined to span 27.8 Mb on the distal region of chromosome arm 2AS as delineated by molecular markers.

This was reinforced by the loss of resistance in Jagger and related cultivars due to the rapid increase of races with <italic>Lr17a</italic> virulence in North America after the release of Jagger in 1996. Our study placed the <italic>Lr17a</italic> locus on 2AS within a 3.1 Mb region, which is orthologous to the 2NS translocation, thus eliminating the possibility of <italic>Lr17a</italic> in Jagger. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bariana and McIntosh (1993)</xref> previously determined that the 2NS translocation and <italic>Lr17a</italic> were in linkage repulsion since they did not recover any F<sub>2</sub> plants with both in a cross between a wheat line with the 2NS translocation and the Thatcher line with <italic>Lr17a</italic>. The <italic>P. triticina</italic> races with virulence to <italic>Lr17a</italic> that have been prevalent in North America since the mid 1990s are also virulent to <italic>Lr37</italic> (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kolmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The <italic>Lr17 locus has</italic> two resistance alleles, <italic>Lr17a originally found in</italic> wheat cultivars Rafaela and EAP 26127 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dyck and Kerber 1977</xref>) and <italic>Lr17b</italic> in the Australian cultivar Harrier (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Singh <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). <italic>Lr17a</italic> and <italic>Lr17b</italic> alleles also have similar IT to the same races, depending on the temperature and leaf rust race (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Singh <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Since <italic>Lr17a</italic>, <italic>Lr17b</italic> and <italic>Lr37</italic> are found in the same region on 2AS and 2NS respectively, these genes may be allelic at the same corresponding loci in the different genomes. Genes <italic>Lr2a</italic>, <italic>Lr2b</italic>, and <italic>Lr2c</italic> are allelic and are highly related for IT to avirulent leaf rust pathogen (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dyck and Samborski 1974</xref>). Since the 2NS translocation and the <italic>Lr17</italic> locus are linked in repulsion it is not possible to conduct classical allelism tests. Further sequencing and characterization of the corresponding regions on 2NS and 2AS may determine the relationship between <italic>Lr37</italic> and the <italic>Lr17</italic> genes. In addition, Jagger carrying <italic>Lr37</italic> on 2NS can be crossed with a cultivar/line that carries <italic>Lr17</italic> on 2AS. This population would segregate for both <italic>Lr37</italic> and <italic>Lr17</italic>, therefore, the two genes could be compared for resistance in the same genetic background.</p><p>The wheat <italic>Lr17</italic> gene was physically delimited into the 3.1 Mb region between <italic>Xgwm636-M</italic> and <italic>Xwmc407-M</italic>. All of the resistance genes residing in the targeted region on chromosome arm 2AS should be candidates for <italic>Lr17a</italic> in wheat. Four genes were predicted to be related with known resistance genes in the 3.1 Mb region between <italic>Xgwm636-M</italic> and <italic>Xwmc407-M</italic>, including <italic>Traes_2AS_5CAF7A367</italic> (encoding a NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance protein), <italic>Traes_2AS_089875521</italic> (encoding a disease resistance RPP13-like protein 1), <italic>Traes_2AS_6E1B0E6EF</italic> (encoding a resistance gene analog 2 (RGA2), and <italic>Traes_2AS_AFEB22E37</italic> (encoding a disease resistance RPP13-like protein 1). In addition, another two genes are located in this region, including <italic>Traes_2AS_D0C21ADB5</italic> that was predicted to encode a WRKY transcription factor, and <italic>Traes_2AS_7B74BE6D6</italic> that was predicted to encode a putative leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase. Further study is needed to test the functions of these candidate genes in wheat.</p><p>An unresolved issue in this study was that the resistance to BBBD in 2174 was not mapped. Recombinant inbred lines with resistance alleles to BBBD derived from 2174 were not identified. 2174 was also resistant to stripe rust when the same population was tested in China (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), but this resistance was also not mapped. Although the Jagger &#x000d7; 2174 RIL population has been genotyped using the wheat 90K SNP assay, not all genomic regions may have been covered, and the uncharacterized part of the genome may have additional stripe and leaf rust resistance genes.</p><p>In summary, the seedling resistance in Jagger was mapped to the 2NS translocation. The 2NS translocation in Jagger was determined to be 24 Mb in length, on the distal region of 2A. The leaf rust resistance gene locus <italic>Lr17</italic> on 2AS, mapped in a 3.1 Mb region, which is orthologous to the 2NS translocation. <italic>Lr37</italic> on the 2NS translocation may be allelic with the <italic>Lr17</italic> locus on 2AS. The population in North America has high level of virulence to <italic>Lr17a</italic> and <italic>Lr37</italic>, however the three minor QTL may be useful in combinations with other effective resistance genes in development of leaf rust resistance cultivars.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by USDA-NIFA T-CAP grant No. 2011-68002-30029, the Oklahoma Center of Advanced Science and Technology (OCAST AR131-033), and the Oklahoma Wheat Research Foundation.
