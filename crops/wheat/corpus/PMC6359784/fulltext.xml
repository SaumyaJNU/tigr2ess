Consequently, medical nutrition therapy (MNT), a spectrum of nutrition services aimed at optimizing individual well-being, is being recognized as integral to the health of people who experience incarceration. However, there is a paucity of research that explores the delivery of MNT in correctional facilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A scoping review combined with secondary analysis of qualitative data (field notes, in-depth stakeholder interviews) from a 2-year ethnographic study about food insecurity and incarceration was undertaken to gain insights about the delivery of corrections-based MNT in Canada. Thematic analysis of all documents was done using an interpretive framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">An understanding about MNT was developed within three themes: 1) specialized service provision in a unique environment; 2) challenges with the provision of MNT; and 3) consideration of corrections-based MNT alternatives. An incarcerated individual&#x02019;s nutritional health was conceptualized as culminating from various factors that included dietary intake and health status, enabling environments, access to quality health services, and clinical nutrition services. Nutrition care practices, which range from health promotion to rehabilitation, are challenged by issues of access, visibility, adequacy, and environmental barriers. Their success is dependent on demand (e.g., ability of recipient to act) and factors that enable quality health and food services. Advancing corrections-based MNT will require policies that provide supportive food and health environments and creating sustainable services by integrating alternatives such as peer approaches and telehealth.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Professional associations, government, researchers and other stakeholders can help to strengthen corrections-based MNT by fostering shifts in thinking about the role of health practitioners in these contexts, preparing future health professionals with the specialized skills needed to work in these environments, generating evidence that can best inform practice, and cultivating collaborations aimed at crime prevention, successful societal reintegration, and the reduction of recidivism.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12913-019-3926-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medical nutrition therapy</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Dietitian</kwd><kwd>Incarceration</kwd><kwd>Prison</kwd><kwd>Qualitative study</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000203</institution-id><institution>Canadian Foundation for Dietetic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>232021-2500</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Community First: Impacts of Community Engagement</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par9">Compared to general populations, people who experience incarceration have poorer physical, mental, and social health, making them among one of the most marginalized populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many incarcerated persons arrive at correctional facilities with histories of inadequate access to preventive care and health services for acute or chronic health problems. Malnutrition, that encompasses both under nutrition and over nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], is common and a major cause of morbidity and mortality both in correctional facilities of developed and less developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">It is well established that nutrition is a determinant of physical and mental health and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indicators of poor nutrition, such as high sodium intakes and dyslipidemia, and dietary risk factors such as substance use, infectious and chronic conditions are prevalent among incarcerated persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Providing appropriate nutrition and food services as a form of duty of care has the potential to generate critical benefits including the prevention of communicable diseases that poses threats to community health, reducing risk of developing non-communicable health conditions and associated cost burdens, improving chronic condition management, reducing problematic and self-harm behaviors, and preventing recidivism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Food and nutrition services within correctional facilities of developed countries generally have two interdependent areas of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The first, often referred as the administrative component, involves the development and implementation of standards, menu planning, food service staff training, budget control, and food policy standards, as well as systems that are foundational to institution activities. The second component involves medical nutrition therapy (MNT), a spectrum of nutrition-related diagnostic, therapy, and counseling services aimed at health and disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. MNT is often delivered by a registered dietitian or nutrition professional who works as part of an interdisciplinary health team. Examples of tasks executed by a MNT practitioner would include nutrition assessment and care planning, collaborative goal setting, implementation and evaluation of an individual&#x02019;s nutrition care plan, interprofessional nutrition education, and advocacy. While nutrition services are generally classified into these two components which are often managed separately, they are integrated in various ways such as in the planning of departmental resources (e.g., food, equipment, type of service delivery), service provision, and policies. Many investigations that focus on nutrition service delivery and incarceration are largely based on food services systems, particularly factors such as food adequacy and quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, investigations of corrections-based MNT have been limited, despite reports that there are significant challenges in practice (e.g., limited resources, working with individuals that have several co-morbidities) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A deepened understanding of the relationships and contextual factors that impact MNT in correctional systems could provide information to improve food and nutrition programs, practices, and policies which, in turn, could reduce health care and criminal justice system costs.</p><p id="Par12">Several information gaps about the implementation, associated challenges, and effectiveness of corrections-based MNT exist. While there have been studies of the administration of food and nutrition services, few discuss the interface with clinical services or the experiences in other developed nations besides the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. In particular, there is a paucity of research from Canada, which has unique correctional service features related to the dispersion and organization of nutrition services. Canadian-based data contributions that include examination of the interconnections between administrative and clinical food and nutrition services could serve to inform global discussions about nutritional status and incarceration. Furthermore, studies aimed at providing information about how healthy environments in Canadian correctional facilities can be created have been identified as a research priority for prison health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In Canada, an ethnographic study that focused on food insecurity and incarceration was undertaken. This investigation included naturalistic observation-based field notes about food provision and nutrition services in correctional facilities. In addition, the study included in-depth individual and focus interview data from individuals who were currently or formerly incarcerated and stakeholders involved in corrections and societal reintegration services. The availability of this detailed data provides a rare opportunity to examine the delivery of MNT in Canadian correctional facilities from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study context</title><p id="Par14">This study was a secondary analysis of data from a qualitative study that focused on food and nutrition systems in federal level correctional facilities (i.e., houses offenders serving a sentence of &#x02265; 2 years) and barriers/facilitators of food security experienced by incarcerated individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

</p></disp-quote>In conjunction with overall health service access issues, delays in access to MNT occurred due to factors such as clinic space constraints. Although on-site health clinics are available, appointments for nutrition counseling, even if requested by an incarcerated person, required a referral by a nurse or physician. Furthermore, if on a given day there was a surplus of health providers in the clinic, MNT would be cancelled in order to provide space.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of factors impacting delivery of corrections-based medical nutrition therapy in Canada (Theme 2)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">1.

<italic>&#x0201c;There&#x02019;s a doctor who comes. Sometimes physio. There is a nurse that works every day &#x02013; does the meds. For other services like dietitian, orthotics, specialists they may need to go out.&#x0201d; (SInc8)</italic>
</p></disp-quote></p><p>In some regions, dietitians were responsible for providing their services to many different facilities and diverse populations (e.g., youth, adults, pregnant women, Aboriginals, older adults).

Based on this framework and study findings, an incarcerated individual&#x02019;s nutritional status depends upon an interplay of immediate factors that include dietary intake, the determinants of health, and health status (e.g., disease state, life stage) as well as underlying influences such as the environment and access to health services (Levels 1 and 2). In Level 2 of the model, MNT and its associated challenges of access, visibility, adequacy, and environmental barriers (Theme 2) are highlighted. Level 3 outlines examples of nutrition care practices; their success is subsequently impacted by: 1) demand for services which is dependent on awareness, motivation to act, and ability to act; and 2) enabling factors that include social norms and support, systems and policies, availability and quality of food, as well as health and support services (Level 4). The other parts of the framework shift to strategies that could help advance MNT delivery. Target groups and practice components that are identified in the model are described in the following.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Working framework of pathways contributing to the nutritional status of incarcerated individuals with potential strategies for future medical nutrition therapy (MNT) practices</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2019_3926_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec18"><title>MNT systems strengthening</title><p id="Par50">Clear system-wide policies and procedures for nutrition care staff, nutrition screening, referral, assessment, and education would help to improve continuity of care and prevent nutrition-related issues (e.g., malnutrition) and their associated complications in incarcerated individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. As interviewees suggested, specific criteria about when they should be consulted and clear communication channels would enable consistent service:<disp-quote><p id="Par51">

</p></disp-quote></p><p>Both the literature and stakeholder interview data highlighted how food choices are multi-factorial, even in correctional contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].<disp-quote><p id="Par52"><italic>&#x0201c;..for example, in a grocery store where they place bags of chips how prominently they display it &#x02026; how large of the percentage of the store is dedicated to certain types of foods &#x02026; the cost of food &#x02026; those choices as far as environment have impact both on habits &#x02026; It&#x02019;s the same in the prison system.. what&#x02019;s available in the vending machines.. what&#x02019;s available in the cafeteria..have long term impacts ..a second sort of factor is..motivation.

This suggests that multiple stakeholders (e.g., facility and community-based, incarcerated individuals) need to be engaged to help implement appropriate strategies that target the multiple determinants of eating. For example, initiatives that are aimed at creating supportive food environments (e.g., improvements in food buy-up schemes, nutritional labeling on menus) and optimizing health and behavior (e.g., nutrition supplement studies in correctional facilities) have been implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Another fundamental gap identified by interviewees was the lack of specific evidence that would help to inform corrections-based nutrition practice. As an example, a dietitian asked about predisposing factors related to healthy weight management and responded:<disp-quote><p id="Par54">&#x0201c;<italic>That is an excellent question, and I don&#x02019;t know. Some of them have always had weight issues, and they have continued to have weight issues, a lot of them didn&#x02019;t and then gained a lot of weight in the institution, but this is just based on my observations.

Data such as the distribution of nutrition-related health conditions in the correctional systems, nutrition interventions that can improve behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and how to tailor services to address the needs of special populations (e.g., seniors) would help to better define types of nutrition services that are needed:<disp-quote><p id="Par55">

</p></disp-quote></p><p>In developed nations, there are many examples of food and nutrition skill building interventions in correctional facilities. Approaches such as training farms that build food literacy and skills of incarcerated individuals have been shown to substantially reduce food costs and improve employment potential of incarcerated individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In some instances, the farms and gardens are located within the community and provide food for residents which aligns with the goals of restorative justice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Examples from the Danish prison system illustrate how culinary education from chefs and self-sufficiency training enabled incarcerated individuals to shop and cook for themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Health promotion and wellness programs that are collaborative, use participatory and peer modeling approaches, and help build employment skills also help to optimize nutrition services as well as health and social outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].

</p></disp-quote></p><p>Integrating different delivery alternatives would also enhance the sustainability of corrections-based MNT. Service delays could be reduced by using telehealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Interdisciplinary care conferencing, group education, and medical appointments could also create efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Collaborations between corrections and agencies that focus on societal reintegration would establish appropriate supports for ongoing nutrition care after incarceration.

</p></disp-quote></p><p>Finally, it must be recognized that future corrections-based MNT is dependent on preparing practitioners for this type of practice.

</p></disp-quote></p><p>As a starting point, utilizing successful models from other correctional settings to address dietitian skills training should be considered. For example, in Australia a service-learning model was adopted that partners government (prisons) and dietetic training programs that is sustainable and mutually beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Dietitians in-training work with nutrition professionals in federal prisons and in turn, the facilities receive students able to take part in hands-on delivery of clinical nutrition services. Over a 3 year trial period, the work of the students was equivalent to one full-time dietitian position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Interprofessional training opportunities that enable learning with, from, and about others in corrections would help prepare nutrition professionals to be successful collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In addition, developing knowledge and skills in cultural competency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], trauma-informed care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], harm reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], and equity-oriented care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] are critical to working effectively in a corrections-based environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par65">While this has been the first study to provide in-depth exploration of MNT in Canadian correctional facilities, the investigative limitations must be noted. The process of bracketing (i.e., self-reflective process of recognizing and setting aside a priori knowledge and assumptions) employed in the original study was not applied in the secondary analysis of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. However, to minimize skewness in the reporting of results, all forms of data from the study were included and integrated with data from a broad scoping review. Selection bias was another limitation as the stakeholders were sampled based on their knowledge and experiences about food insecurity related to incarceration. However, conversations about food insecurity relied heavily on reflections about food and nutrition services in the corrections system and as part of the original sampling frame corrections-based food, nutrition, and health personnel were purposely selected. The individuals with experiences of incarceration who were interviewed may have been more health literate and may not have discussed issues that others face. The study was primarily conducted within one region of Canada and the results may not be generalizable to all provinces, territories, and incarcerated individuals. For example, few young individuals (e.g., &#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x02009;years) and older adults were sampled. Further work in other regions, examining utilization data, and exploring experiences among more diverse groups would help to verify these findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par66">Having access to health care services such as MNT while incarcerated and during reintegration, along with other factors, can help lead to various societal benefits including reduced health care and social costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>].
