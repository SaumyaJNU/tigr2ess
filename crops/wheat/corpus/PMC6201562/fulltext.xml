We identified 523 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between 10 DAA and 15 DAA, and 229 DEPs between ZM366 and YM49&#x02013;198. These DEPs mainly participate in eight biochemical processes: carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, stress/defense, transport, energetics-related, signal transduction, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, and nucleic acid-related processes. Among these proteins, the DEPs showing higher expression levels at 10 DAA are mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress/defense, and nucleic acid related processes, whereas DEPs with higher expression levels at 15 DAA are mainly carbohydrate metabolism, energetics-related, and transport-related proteins. Among the DEPs between the two cultivars, ZM366 had more up-regulated proteins than YM49&#x02013;198, and these are mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acid-related processes, and transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The results of our study indicate that wheat grain amyloplast has the broad metabolic capability.

Wheat flour is used in a wide range of applications including bread, pasta, steamed bread, noodles, pastries, and cookies. Starch endosperm accounts for &#x0003e;&#x02009;80% of the volume of the wheat kernel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, wheat kernel weight is largely determined by starch biosynthesis and storage, and improving starch biosynthesis could increase starch accumulation and kernel weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Starch consists of two major components; amylose, a linear &#x003b1;-1,4 linked D-glucose polymer, and amylopectin, a branched &#x003b1;-1,4 and &#x003b1;-1,6 D-glucose polymer. In the starch granule, it is widely acknowledged that starch is deposited as B-type granules (diameter&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x000a0;9.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m), and A-type granules (diameter&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x000a0;9.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) in mature wheat grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Starch components and the granule size distribution strongly influence starch physicochemical properties and the functionality of wheat flours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Amyloplasts are a specialized type of leucoplast that serves as the major site of synthesis and long-term storage of starch in the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many starch granules are formed and developed within a single amyloplast, and the amyloplast envelope begins to degrade after the amyloplast becomes full of starch granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The number of plastid DNA copies per amyloplast increases from ~&#x02009;10 copies at 9&#x000a0;days after anthesis (DAA) to ~&#x02009;50 copies in the mature amyloplast at 31 DAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are functional connections between starch biosynthesis and the structure of internal amyloplast membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The amyloplast membrane protein SSG6, encodes a protein homologous to aminotransferase, and is a novel protein controlling starch grain size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A previous study in rice also showed that one or more biochemical processes in the amyloplast stroma control carbon flux into starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By analogy with chloroplasts and the related non-photosynthetic etioplasts, amyloplasts should have broad metabolic capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Balmer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Andon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have suggested that amyloplasts are involved in many metabolic functions in addition to starch production. The results of proteomics studies also showed that amyloplasts play a central role in endosperm metabolism, and that the amyloplast may possess a regulatory mechanism that mediates the effect of interaction between genes and environment on protein and starch production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition to starch, some important factors (timing, duration, and rate of grain filling) that determine the final protein yield are largely controlled by the amyloplasts present in the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Amyloplasts also play a role in kernel hardness, and lipids associated with the starch granule surface mainly originate from the amyloplast bilayer lipid membrane which is degraded during seed desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Grain filling is an important process for kernel development, grain compound accumulation, and for determining the final kernel weight and flour quality. Proteomic approaches have been widely used to identify the array of proteins present in the developing wheat grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Apart from the whole grain, some studies have also focused on isolated organelles or tissues, such as nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], wheat aleurone layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and kernel periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These studies have provided valuable information about the biochemical processes involved in wheat grain development. Proteomics have also been used to characterize wheat amyloplast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the results showed that amyloplasts in the developing wheat endosperm have broad metabolic capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">However, as mentioned above, different wheat types (such as hard vs. soft), and different grain developmental stages have different physiological processes. Previous reports have reviewed the metabolic processes that occur in the wheat amyloplast, but there is little information available about amyloplasts from different wheat cultivars at different stages of grain filling. The label-free-based quantitative proteome method allows for sensitive and accurate protein quantification. In this study, two wheat cultivars with different kernel hardness and starch characteristics were used to study the differentially expressed amyloplast proteins during grain development using the label-free technique. Our findings will provide insights into the function of wheat amyloplast during grain development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Comparing grain characteristics in the two wheat cultivars</title><p id="Par25">As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, hard wheat cultivar ZM366 had higher protein content, while the soft wheat cultivar YM49 had higher kernel weight.

Understanding amyloplast metabolism will provide more useful information about starch biosynthesis and starch physiochemical characteristics. To gain additional insight into the role of amyloplast metabolism, the amyloplast proteins from two different wheat cultivars at two developmental stages were analyzed in this study. We found that multiple metabolic processes, including energy and carbon metabolism, signal transduction, stress/defense, transport, nucleic acid-related, and protein synthesis/assembly/degradation were involved in amyloplast metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Carbohydrate metabolism</title><p id="Par45">Carbohydrate metabolism is one of the most important metabolic processes during grain development. A previous report describing the wheat grain proteome found that 21% of the DEPs were involved in carbohydrate metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Here, proteome analysis of the amyloplast at two grain developmental stages showed that an average of 21.50% of the DEPs participate in carbohydrate metabolism, indicating that carbohydrate metabolism is also one of the primary functions of the amyloplast. Amyloplasts are the major site of synthesis and long-term storage of starch in the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Here, only some of the amyloplast DEPs detected were involved in starch metabolism, which is in agreement with Dupont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Starch biosynthesis in plants involves the concerted action of a number of enzymes, including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGase), starch synthases (SS), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), starch branching enzymes (SBE), and debranching enzymes (DBE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. SS and SBE are related to amylopectin synthesis, and amylose synthesis is controlled by GBSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We found that two SSs (Q43654 and A0A1D5T6Q3), two SBEs (A0A1D6RLR1 and G3CCE7) and a single 1, 4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (A0A1D5U5L3) were significantly down-regulated in the 15 DAA sample compared to 10 DAA. However, no significant DEPs were found related to GBSS, which indicates that there are differences between amylose and amylopectin biosynthesis during grain development. In addition, the expression levels of SSs at 15 DAA were 0.03~&#x02009;0.04-fold higher than those of at 10DAA, whereas that of SBE were 0.23~&#x02009;0.32-fold. The different levels of down-regulated expression maybe contribute to different starch physicochemical properties. Toyosawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] found that SSIIIa have a crucial role in determining granule morphology and in maintaining the amyloplast envelopment structure in rice seeds; whereas SBE mutation altered the fine structure of amylopectin, and the endosperm starch from the <italic>sbe1</italic> mutant had a lower onset temperature for thermo-gelatinization compared with the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Of course, just as Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], speculated that these enzymes proteins may have a coordinating action in starch biosynthesis within the amyloplast, operating as functional multiprotein complexes. The different expression patterns of these DEPs may partly reflect that there is coordination mechanism of starch synthesis in wheat grains. The SS and SBE in the two wheat cultivars showed the same expression patterns from 10 DAA to 15 DAA. ZM366 had relatively higher expression levels of SS (A0A1D5T6Q3) than did YM49&#x02013;198 at 10 DAA, and YM49&#x02013;198 showed cultivar-specific expression of five GBSS proteins (A0A1D6L3I4, O81591, Q9AWE1, Q9SBD2, and D71C0) at 10 and 15 DAA; all of these differences could contribute to the synthesis of different types of starch and result in different starch properties between two wheat cultivars. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], suggested that the change of GBSS activity were consistent with the amylose content indicating that amylose in grain are determined by GBSS activity, especially at later grain filling stages. Here, we also found that YM49&#x02013;198 had a higher amylose content than did ZM366 (data not shown), which indicates that these DEPs may contribute to amylose accumulation. The study of SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines revealed that the double mutation had increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities, and also affected the fine structure of amylopectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The up-regulated expression of SS in ZM366 may be related to starch properties. Here, only DEPs in amyloplast at the early grain developmental stages were studied, and the metabolic process of amyloplast at the later grain developmental stages need further study.</p><p id="Par46">Alph- and beta-amylases required for starch degradation were not detected in wheat grain amyloplasts by Dupont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, YM49&#x02013;198 had relatively higher expression levels of beta-amylases (A0A1D5XGF3) than did ZM366 at 10 DAA, which may indicate that there are different degrees of starch degradation in wheat grain. However, Agrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] found that triticale S71&#x02013;142 had more amylase activity at certain stages of grain development than triticale IMJ3 but the grain of S71&#x02013;142 was much better than IMJ3, indicating that amylases are not related to the grain shriveling. Further studies are needed on the role of amylase in starch synthesis during grain development. Interestingly, six and eight DEPs between 10 DAA and 15 DAA that involve the photosystems, including chlorophyll 1-b binding protein, were detected in ZM366 and YM49&#x02013;198, respectively. It has been hypothesized that these proteins are actual amyloplast constituents, and do not result from contamination with chloroplast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Amyloplasts are non-pigmented plastids and, along with chloroplasts, are derived from proplastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is clear that starch synthesis and storage also take place in chloroplasts; amyloplasts and chloroplasts are closely related, and it was found that potato amyloplasts can turn into chloroplasts in the light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable that photosynthesis-related proteins are detected in amyloplasts.</p><p id="Par47">Apart from photosynthesis and starch metabolism, we found that some DEPs involved in other types of carbohydrate metabolic processes were up-regulated from 10 DAA to 15 DAA, but others were down-regulated. The broad distribution of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes suggests that plastids are actively involved in other processes in addition to starch synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Analysis of the rice ADP-glucose (ADPG) transporter also showed that there are one or more biochemical processes in amyloplast stroma that control carbon flux into starch, which affects starch synthesis and kernel weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, even though the two wheat cultivars in our study showed similar protein expression patterns with grain development, cultivar ZM366 had more up-regulated DEPs and cultivar-specific proteins than did YM49&#x02013;198. These results indicate that the amyloplasts in the two wheat cultivars have similar functions, and that the DEPs between the two wheat cultivars and the cultivar-specific proteins may be responsible for the differences in both starch content and characteristics. Further research is needed to define the regulatory role of amyloplast on starch synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Transport proteins</title><p id="Par48">Membrane transporters serve as internal and external exchange components in the amyloplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It has been reported that the majority of ADPG in cereal grain endosperm is generated in cytosol from AGPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and is subsequently transported into amyloplasts by the BRITTLE-1 (BT1) protein located in the plastid envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A study of the rice BRITTLE1 mutation demonstrated that ADPG transport by BT1 is essential for the normal rate of starch synthesis in rice endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Here, we found that two brittle-1 transporter proteins (A0A1D6AX03 and A0A1D6DJD7) in the two wheat cultivars were up-regulated at 15 DAA compared with 10 DAA, indicating that more ADPG transport occurs with grain development. And for BRITTLE-1 protein transport of ADPG, there are different exchange substrates. Biochemical transport studies of maize BT1 showed that it imports ADPG through counter exchange with ADP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Recombinant BT1 protein synthesized from potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>) showed that StBT1 does not transport ADPG but does transport AMP, ADP, and ATP, and that the transport of AMP, ADP, and ATP occurs in a unidirectional rather than antiportal mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. AtBT1 is a plastidal nucleotide uniport carrier protein that is strictly required for the export of newly synthesized adenylates into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The wheat BT1 homolog also transports ADPG but has similar affinities for ADP and AMP as the counter-exchange substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In this study, we do not know the identity of the exchange substrate of the BRITTLE-1 protein, but two ADP, ATP carrier proteins were significantly down-regulated at 15 DAA. The expression pattern of the BRITTLE-1 protein suggests a difference in amyloplast metabolism at the different developmental stages; the mode of specific transport of ADPG may also need further investigation. Also, we found that ZM366 had higher levels of BRITTLE-1 transporter expressed at 15 DAA compared to YM49&#x02013;198. However, the starch content is slightly lower in ZM366, which could indicate that the regulation of other metabolic processes on starch synthesis affects starch content. Overexpression of the maize protein ZmBt1 in rice lines showing elevated ADPG levels in the amyloplasts did not lead to further increases in seed weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additionally, some essential DEPs for ion channels, transmembrane family proteins, and translocators were detected with grain development and between the two wheat cultivars, suggesting that there is complexity in the transport machinery of the plastid envelope, and that transport varies with grain development and between wheat cultivars.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Stress/defense</title><p id="Par49">A number of stress/defense proteins that act against biotic or abiotic stress are expressed throughout wheat grain development. Serpin family proteins play an important role in plant growth, development, and the stress response by irreversible inhibition of endogenous and exogenous proteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It has been suggested that wheat grain serpins probably protect storage proteins from digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In our study, the expression levels of five serpins (C0LF31, C0LF30, A0A1D5ZBL7, H9AXB3, and Q9ST57) in the two wheat cultivars were increased at 15 DAA, especially in wheat cultivar ZM366, and the average expression level increased by almost 52-fold. Two serpins, H9AXB3 and Q9ST57, were reported to be phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and phosphorylation would increase their activity and protect the proteins from degradation. &#x003b1;-Amylase inhibitors also play important roles in protecting starch and proteins in the endosperm from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Here, &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitors (five in ZM366 and six in YM49&#x02013;198) were found to accumulate to high levels in the amyloplasts from 10 to 15 DAA. &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitor DEPs have also been found in grain from 21 to 42 DAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Apart from serpins, small heat shock proteins and chaperone proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular functions. For example, Hsp70 can stabilize protein conformation, prevent aggregation, and maintain non-native proteins in a competent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Unlike the expression patterns of serpins and &#x003b1;-amylase inhibitors, heat shock and chaperone proteins all showed higher expression levels at 10 DAA compared to 15 DAA.

The different expression patterns of stress/defense related proteins may reflect their different functions in the response to diverse stress conditions at different developmental stages. Additionally, there were some proteins that showed different expression patterns between the two wheat cultivars at the same stage; these proteins that showed response differences could play roles in yield-related traits and quality-related traits. This is similar to previous reports that proteins abundances differing between two cultivars were possibly associated with yield-related traits in bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Nucleic acid-related proteins</title><p id="Par51">The DEPs involved in nucleic acid-related processes were 14.25% of the total DEPs detected in our study, which was similar to a previous finding in wheat amyloplasts at 10 DAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Here, the DEPs were mainly RNA/DNA binding proteins, ribosomal proteins, and translation/elongation factors. Interestingly, most of the RNA/DNA binding and ribosomal proteins were up-regulated, while the translation initiation/elongation factors were down-regulated from 10 DAA to 15 DAA. In the two wheat cultivars, ZM366 had more highly expressed proteins at 10 DAA than did YM49&#x02013;198, while the numbers of highly expressed proteins were comparable at 15 DAA. A study of amyloplast DNA showed that there was a large increase in the amount of plastid DNA (ptDNA) per endosperm between 9 and ~&#x02009;15 DAA, and the average number of ptDNA copies per amyloplast increased from 10 copies at 9 DAA to ~&#x02009;50 copies in the mature amyloplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
