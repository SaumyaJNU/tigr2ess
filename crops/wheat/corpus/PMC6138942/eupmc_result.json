    "The adoption of metal binder jetting additive manufacturing (AM) for functional parts relies on a deep understanding between the materials, the design aspects, the additive manufacturing process and sintering. This work focuses on the relationship between sintering theory and process outcomes. The data included in this article provides additional supporting information on the authors' recent publication (Wheat et al., 2018 [1]) on the sinter structure analysis of commercially pure titanium parts manufactured using powder bed binder jetting additive manufacturing. For this work, commercially pure titanium was deployed to study the effect of powder size distributions on green and sintered part qualities (bulk density, relative density, particle size, pore size, sinter neck size). This manuscript includes the overall computed tomography visualization methods and results for the green and sintered samples using uni- and bi-modal powders. Moreover, the effective particle and pore size for the different batches of powder are presented."
