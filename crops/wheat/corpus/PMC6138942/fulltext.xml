This work focuses on the relationship between sintering theory and process outcomes. The data included in this article provides additional supporting information on the authors&#x02019; recent publication (Wheat et al., 2018 [1]) on the sinter structure analysis of commercially pure titanium parts manufactured using powder bed binder jetting additive manufacturing. For this work, commercially pure titanium was deployed to study the effect of powder size distributions on green and sintered part qualities (bulk density, relative density, particle size, pore size, sinter neck size). This manuscript includes the overall computed tomography visualization methods and results for the green and sintered samples using uni- and bi-modal powders. Moreover, the effective particle and pore size for the different batches of powder are presented.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications Table</bold><table-wrap id="t0015" position="float"><alt-text id="at0060">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td>Engineering, Materials Science</td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td>Additive Manufacturing</td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td>Figures</td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td>Design of Experiments, X-ray computed tomography (CT), analytics on CT datasets</td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td>Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td>The samples were manufactured using multiple unimodal and bimodal powder blends using binder jetting additive manufacturing and sintered to study the sinter structure.</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td>For this work, all titanium powders used were plasma atomized, Grade 1 commercially pure (CP).

While other, more conventional metallurgical analysis methods, such as scanning electron or optical microscopy were available, they were deemed unsuitable. While these methods do provide useful data, they are limited to small regions of interest (ROI) and can only provide information on the outer, visible surface of the parts. Samples were scanned two at a time, with the samples stacked vertically in a sample holder. Scanning parameters are provided in the work by Wheat et al. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The samples were spaced using paper since the material has a significantly lower attenuation, allowing both samples to be easily distinguished from each other. Samples also had a chamfer cut on the top surface to allow for consistent alignment of the part to the orthogonal axes after being scanned. The orientation of the scanner axes with respect to the printed parts is shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, with the <italic>Z</italic> axis of the CT scanner corresponding to the build direction.
