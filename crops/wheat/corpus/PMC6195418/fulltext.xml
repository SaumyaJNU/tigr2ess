Among <italic>Mayetiola</italic> species are Hessian fly (<italic>Mayetiola destructor Say</italic>), barley midge (<italic>Mayetiola hordei Keiffer</italic>), and oat midge (<italic>Mayetiola avenae Marchal</italic>). Larvae of these species inject saliva into host tissues to manipulate plants. To identify putative effectors, transcriptomic analyses were conducted on transcripts encoding secreted salivary gland proteins (SSGPs) from first instar larvae of the barley and oat midges, since SSGPs are the most likely source for effector proteins delivered into host tissues. From barley midge, 178 SSGP-encoding unigenes were identified, which were sorted into 51 groups. From oat midge, 194 were obtained and sorted into 50 groups. Predicted proteins within a group had a highly conserved secretion signal peptide and shared at least 30% amino acid identity. Among the identified unigenes from both barley and oat midges, ~68% are conserved either among the three species or between two of them. Conserved SSGPs included members belonging to SSGP-1, SSGP-4, SSGP-11, and SSGP-71 families. Unconventional conservation patterns exist among family members within a species and among different gall midges, indicating that these genes are under high selection pressure, a characteristic of effector genes. SSGPs that are unique to each species were also identified. Those conserved SSGPs may be responsible for host manipulation since the three gall midges produce identical phenotypic symptoms to host plants, whereas the SSGPs unique to each species may be responsible for different host specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>barley midge</kwd><kwd>oat midge</kwd><kwd>transcriptome analysis</kwd><kwd>secreted salivary gland protein</kwd><kwd>insect effector</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Cereal crops are attacked by various herbivorous insects (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gagn&#x000e9; 1989</xref>). Among these insect pests are stem gall midge species from the genus <italic>Mayetiola</italic>, including the Hessian fly (<italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic> Say), the barley stem gall midge (barley midge, <italic>M. hordei</italic> Keiffer), and the oat stem gall midge (oat midge, <italic>M. avenae</italic> Marchal). These species are major insects causing severe damage yearly to their host plants in specific regions or worldwide (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gagn&#x000e9; 2010</xref>).</p><p>Gall midges have four life stages: eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. The Hessian fly, barley midge, and oat midge cause damage to host plants at the first two instar larval stages (also called maggots), whereas third instar larvae, pupae, and adults do not feed. First instar larvae attack plants by injecting salivary secretions into plant tissues to establish a permanent feeding site. Second instar larvae feed vigorously on plant tissues at the feeding site established by the first instar. The third instar becomes a nonfeeding puparium stage. The first instar is the most critical stage since it paves the way for the second instar larvae to feed. Larvae of the three gall midges are sessile and they feed by sucking up liquid from nutritive tissues (the gall) (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Stuart et al. 2012</xref>). The adult stage of the life cycle is short (surviving for 1&#x02013;3 d), and is specialized only for reproduction.</p><p>Morphologically, the three gall midge species are very similar at all four developmental stages. However, each species has its own preferred host plants. The preferred host for Hessian fly is wheat, although it can also survive on certain cultivars of barley and oat if no wheat plants are available (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Gagn&#x000e9; et al. 1991</xref>). Previous reports suggested that the preferred host for barley midge is barley, but it has also been recorded on wheat, oat, and rye (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Gagn&#x000e9; et al. 1991</xref>). The preferred host of oat midge is oat, but it can also occur on the wild plant <italic>Avena fatua</italic>, and wheat (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnes 1956</xref>). However, in the field, the barley midge survives and develops well only on barley (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lhaloui 1995</xref>). Similarly, the oat midge can feed and survive well on oat, but not on wheat or barley (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barnes 1956</xref>).</p><p>Although each gall midge has its own preferred host plants, the three species cause almost identical symptoms to infested plants. Infested susceptible plants are stunted due to irreversible inhibition of plant growth, the color of leaves become dark green due to increased chlorophylls, and the attacked plant will eventually die if no new tillers grow out. The molecular mechanisms required for the three midges to parasitize different host species, which cause identical symptoms to each host, remain to be delineated.</p><p>Interactions between the Hessian fly and wheat have been studied relatively extensively due to its important pest status in the United States (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Stuart 2015</xref>). Previous research efforts have revealed that there are hundreds of secreted salivary gland proteins (SSGPs) produced in the salivary glands of Hessian fly larvae (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2004</xref>). Systematic transcriptomic analyses have revealed a high proportion (about 60%) of transcripts in salivary glands of first instar larvae that encode SSGPs (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>). Genome sequencing revealed more than 7% of predicted genes in the Hessian fly genome encode effector-like proteins (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). The great diversity in Hessian fly SSGPs has been indicated in many studies (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al. 2009</xref>). A large number of Hessian fly SSGPs contain consensus characteristics of parasite effectors (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). In addition, several avirulence effectors have been cloned from the Hessian fly and all of them are SSGPs (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aggarwal et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on Hessian fly data and studies on other sucking insects, SSGPs secreted into host tissues during feeding play critical roles in attacking plants, and are likely the main source for effector proteins (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Hatchett et al. 1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>). The Hessian fly, barley midge, and oat midge share the same feeding mechanism and result in almost identical symptoms on infested host plants, yet each species attacks only certain host plants and cannot survive on the others. Based on these biological observations, we hypothesize that these three midges inject conserved effectors into host tissues to manipulate host plants, resulting in similar symptoms such as inhibition of plant growth, suppression of host defense, and inducing nutritive tissue formation at the feeding site. We also hypothesize that the three midges inject some unique effectors into host tissues to allow each species to live on different host plants. The objectives of this study are to identify SSGP-encoding transcripts from the first instar larvae of barley midge and oat midge, and to compare these SSGPs among the Hessian fly, barley midge, and oat midge for identification of SSGPs conserved among the three species and SSGPs unique to each of them.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Insects and Salivary Gland Dissection</title><p>Salivary gland preparation was conducted in the Entomological Research Laboratory at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Area (ICARDA) in Rabat, Morocco. Larvae for dissection were obtained directly from plants in the fields that were infested naturally either by barley midge or oat midge. Three-day-old larvae were selected for dissection. At least 300 pairs of salivary glands from a species were pooled together for RNA extraction and library construction. Dissection was achieved in saline buffer by pulling away the anterior tip of a larva with a pair of forceps while holding the posterior end of the larva steady with another pair of forceps. The salivary glands of the larva move out of the cascade during this process along with other internal tissues. Clean salivary glands were then obtained by removing unwanted tissues (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Al-Jbory et al. (2018)</xref>. Salivary glands were put into TRI reagent (Molecular Research, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as soon as they were dissected from the larvae of each species. The salivary samples in TRI reagent were frozen in liquid nitrogen and were shipped to the USDA Hessian fly research laboratory at Manhattan, KS, United States, for further processing and analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RNA Extraction, cDNA Library Construction, and DNA Sequencing</title><p>Each RNA sample was extracted from a pool of 300 pairs of salivary glands from a species. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. RNA quality and integrity were analyzed using a TapeStation Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The RNA samples were then reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. The cDNA samples were amplified using a &#x02018;SMART&#x02019; library construction kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) as described by <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2004)</xref>. Briefly, amplified cDNA inserts were ligated into the pPCRXL-TOPO plasmid contained in a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The ligated plasmids were then transformed into individual bacteria. Bacterial clones were picked up individually for plasmid DNA isolation, which were sequenced with the M13 forward and reverse primers via a commercial contract (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Sequence Analysis</title><p>Based on our previous experience with Hessian fly, cDNA clones were sequenced following the traditional Sanger DNA sequencing method because SSGP genes in <italic>Mayetiola</italic> species are unconventionally conserved among family members (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). Highly diversified coding regions surrounded by highly conserved untranslated regions (UTRs) within a short sequence prevent SSGP transcripts to be assembled correctly from short sequence reads produced from a next generation sequencing approach. In addition, the lack of genome sequences for both barley and oat midges makes Sanger-derived sequences more reliable than contigs assembled from short sequence reads.</p><p>After sequencing, vector sequences were trimmed manually from raw reads. Pairwise alignment sequences from sense and antisense directions were aligned to examine if a clone was sequenced fully from both directions. If no overlap was found between the sense and antisense reads, new primers were synthesized for further sequencing. In our analysis, we have identified unigenes and groups. Each unigene represents a cDNA encoding a unique protein and each unigene may contain multiple redundant clones. Unigenes were further sorted into groups based on sequence similarity.</p><p>Local databases were established with the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs from barley and oat midges, separately. Cluster analyses of these cDNAs were conducted using BlastStation-Local 64 program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blaststation.com/intl/en/local64.php">https://www.blaststation.com/intl/en/local64.php</ext-link>). To verify the similarity of sequences in each clustered group, multiple alignments of nucleotide sequences were conducted using Clustal Omega (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</ext-link>). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated, and representative proteins from each group were aligned using CLUSTAL(W) implemented in MEGA program with 100 bootstrap replicates. The purpose of the phylogenetic tree was merely to further confirm the validity of the groups for each species, and not to measure the genetic distance.</p><p>Similarity analyses between sequences from different species were performed using Blastx or Blastp for two sequence comparison (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). Sequence alignments with <italic>E</italic>-values greater than 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> were considered to have no meaningful sequence similarity between the two sequences. Sequence alignments with <italic>E</italic>-values smaller than 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> were considered that two sequences share significant similarity. Sequence alignments with <italic>E</italic>-values between 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> were further examined individually to determine if two sequences share similarity based on the length of the regions with sequence similarity and gaps within the alignments. Secretion signal peptides were identified using SignalP version 4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/">www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>) after individual nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acid sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/</ext-link>). To identify homologous members of SSGPs groups among the three species, reciprocal blast was conducted using BlastStation-Local 64 program for the local database that was already established for the nucleotide sequences of the three species.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>The Genetic Variation of Genes Within and Between Species</title><p>To test sequence variations of genes within a species, the mutation rates among SSGP members within a group in either barley midge or oat midge were estimated. Nucleotide sequences of members from each group were selected and aligned using CLUSTAL(W). Total numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations and <italic>dN/dS</italic> (&#x003c9;) ratio were calculated using codon-based <italic>Z</italic>-test selection from the MEGA 5.2.2 program. The alternative hypothesis that used in this analysis was positive selection, namely <italic>HA</italic>: <italic>dN</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>dS</italic> at <italic>P</italic>-values smaller than 0.05. The variance of the difference was computed using the bootstrap method (100 replicates). Analyses were conducted using the Nei&#x02013;Gojobori method. This method not only computes the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, but also the numbers of potentially synonymous and potentially nonsynonymous substitutions per site (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Nei and Gojobori 1986</xref>). Eleven groups from barley midge and nine groups from oat midge were selected for this analysis since each group has multiple unigenes.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using amino acid sequences. Members from the four conserved families, SSGP-1, SSGP-4, SSGP-11, SSGP-71, were aligned using CLUSTAL(W). Maximum likelihood trees based on Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) model with 100 bootstrap were generated using the MEGA program. Secreted proteins from salivary glands of wheat midge larvae (<italic>Sitodiplosis mosellana</italic>) were used as reference in this analysis (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Al-Jbory et al. 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Results</title><sec id="s7"><title>Composition and Classification of Transcripts From Barley Midge and Oat Midge</title><p>To identify SSGP-encoding transcripts from both species, cDNA clones were sequenced and only high quality sequences were retained. From the barley midge, 2,570 cDNA clones were sequenced, and 743 cDNA sequences were retained. Among the good quality cDNAs, 458 (61.6%) encode SSGPs and the remaining 285 (38.4%) encode proteins without a typical secretion signal peptide. The 458 SSGP-encoding cDNAs were sorted into 178 unigenes based on sequence similarity, and each unigene encoded a unique protein. Among the 178 unigenes, 102 (57.3%) had sequence similarity to SSGPs from Hessian fly, and remaining 76 (42.7%) with no sequence similarity to any Hessian fly sequences or any known sequences in GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supp Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supp Table S1</xref> [online only]).</p><p>From the oat midge, 3,226 cDNA clones were sequenced, and 718 cDNA sequences were retained.

In the genus <italic>Mayetiola</italic>, the three stem midges, Hessian fly, barley midge, and oat midge, do not induce typical outgrowth galls, but they can inhibit plant growth and induce nutritive tissues at the feeding site. The three gall midges share the same feeding mechanism and cause identical symptoms to host plants. However, each species infests a different host plant. The genetic mechanisms behind this type of peculiar feeding mechanism and molecular determinants for different host specificity are not known, but presumably are linked with effectors injected into host plants during feeding (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Hatchett et al. 1990</xref>). Like other insect species, secreted proteins from salivary glands are the major source of effectors for plant manipulation and host selection (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Accordingly, identification and comparative analyses of SSGPs from the three gall midge species may lead to discovery of key effectors responsible for manipulating host plants, and molecular determinants that allow a specific gall midge species to live on a specific host plant.</p><p>In this study, we first identified SSGPs from barley midge and oat midge via a transcriptomic approach. Over 60% of total transcripts from both species were SSGP-encoding transcripts, which is similar to that observed in Hessian fly (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>). In addition to the high percentage of SSGP-encoding transcripts, there was also high percentage of transcripts encoding proteins that were either involved directly in protein synthesis or in housekeeping functions related to protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supp Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">S4</xref> [online only]). This suggested that the larval salivary glands of the three stem gall midges are specialized tissues for synthesis of proteins for host injection. This high proportion of SSGPs have also revealed from two other gall midges, the wheat midge (<italic>S. mosellana</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Al-Jbory et al. 2018</xref>), and the Asian rice gall midge (<italic>Orseolia oryzae</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our comparative analysis revealed additional similarities among SSGPs from the three species. Similar features of SSGPs from the three gall midge species included 1) high proportion of conserved SSGPs; 2) small sizes for the majority of putative SSGPs; 3) lack of similarity to other proteins in GenBank database; and 4) the existence of the so-called unconventional conservation pattern among gene family members (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>). The differences among SSGPs from the three midges are mainly the diversity of the mature proteins.</p><p>Among SSGPs conserved in the three gall midges are members from family SSGP-1. SSGP-1 family members encode small proteins with 80&#x02013;100 amino acids, and represent the most abundant groups in terms of transcripts in the salivary glands of first instar larvae for all the three gall midges. Based on this study, 78 out of 178 unigenes from barley midge, and 90 of 194 unigenes from oat midge were from the SSGP-1 family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supp Table S5</xref> [online only]). Based on a previous study, around 30% of total salivary gland transcripts from Hessian fly were from this family (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>). Members from the SSGP-1 family have also the consensus motif that is similar to those observed in some pathogen effectors (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Petre and Kamoun 2014</xref>). SSGP-1 members are also exclusively expressed in the crucial larval stage for host infestation (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). All these characteristics suggest that members in the SSGP-1 family may play important roles in host manipulation and virulence of the three midges.</p><p>Other SSGPs conserved among the three species were from families SSGP-4, SSGP-11, and SSGP-71. Members from SSGP-4 and SSGP-11 families encode small proteins with similar characteristics as in SSGP-1 family members except with less abundant transcripts and lack the consensus motif. These conserved members may also play roles in the conserved feeding mechanism among the three gall midges. On the other hand, members from the SSGP-71 family encode relatively large proteins with more than 400 amino acid residues (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). It is believed that SSGP-71 proteins are a novel class of F-box-LRR (leucine-rich repeats) mimics, which allow larvae of Hessian fly to control the plant proteasome to induce the nutritive cells and ultimately stunt plant growth (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). The existence of SSGP-71 homologs in barley and oat midges suggests similar effector roles of these conserved members in barley and oat midges, which are critical in interactions between gall midges and host plants. Some SSGPs were found conserved only between barley and oat midges with no corresponding homologues in Hessian fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supp Table S6</xref> [online only]). These SSGPs are likely absent in Hessian fly since the Hessian fly genome has been sequenced and the Hessian fly salivary gland transcriptome has been analyzed extensively. We postulate that the SSGPs conserved between barley and oat midges contribute to the ability of these two insects to attack barley and oat plants, which share a closer evolutionary relationship than to wheat (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Kellogg 1998</xref>).</p><p>Most of the identified SSGP transcripts from barley and oat midges encode proteins with 50&#x02013;180 amino acid residues. All predicted small SSGPs are unique with no meaningful (<italic>E</italic> &#x0003e; 0.001) sequence similarity to any known proteins in GenBank. Therefore, the functions of these SSGPs remained to be determined. Small proteins are used as effectors by other insects, such as MpC002 and Me10 from aphids, which are less than 150 kD (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Thorpe et al. 2016</xref>). Small secreted proteins have been also found to play crucial roles in interactions between pathogens and plants (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Lyu et al. 2016</xref>). One apparent advantage for small effectors is that they may be easier to penetrate into host tissues once they are injected into host plants.</p><p>One of the common features of SSGPs from the three gall midges is that many gene families exhibit unconventional conservation among family members. Unconventional conservation was first discovered in SSGP genes from Hessian fly, which exhibited highly conserved 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs, regions encoding signal peptides, and introns, but highly diversified regions that encode mature proteins (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>). In this study, the unconventional conservation was also found among SSGP gene family members from barley midge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup11">Supp Fig. S5-1</xref> [online only]) and oat midge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup11">Supp Fig. S5-2</xref> [online only]). Sequence alignments of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs for family 1 members revealed that these regions are not only highly conserved within a midge, but are also highly conserved among the three midges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup11">Supp Fig. S5-3</xref> [online only]). The reason for the unconventional conservation pattern remains unknown. One possibility is that the UTRs are conserved for regulation of gene expression, or that the UTRs are highly conserved because these genes arose through gene duplications relatively recently, and have not enough time to be diversified under random mutation, whereas the coding regions are highly diversified under strong positive selection pressure (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>). The unconventional conservation has been also found in some of the SSGP cDNAs from the Asian rice gall midge <italic>O. oryzae</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>), but not from the wheat midge <italic>S. mosellana</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Al-Jbory et al. 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite conservation of UTRs among homologous SSGP gene families among the three gall midges, the mature SSGP proteins are highly diversified. Our analyses showed that none of the identified SSGPs share 90% or greater sequence identity between proteins obtained from different insect species. The diversification may reflect positive selection for mutations in effectors to avoid host recognition for defense responses. Positive selection appears to be one of the forces driving diversifications in the coding regions of some of the SSGP groups among the three species based on <italic>dN/dS</italic> ratio from this study (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The fast-evolving nature of SSGP-encoding genes in all three species is another indicator that these genes were under high selection pressure for functional adaptation during coevolution with the host plant (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Thompson 1998</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the SSGPs conserved among the three species or between two of them, 32% of unigenes from barley midge and oat midge share no homology to SSGPs from Hessian fly or any other species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supp Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">S2</xref> [online only]). Considering that each gall midge species parasitizes different host plants, these unique putative effectors might be responsible for host specificities. However, the uniqueness of SSGPs in different species could be due to the fact that some of them have not been identified due to low coverage of transcripts of barley and oat midges. The reason we adapted a traditional library construction and sequencing strategy is because SSGP genes in <italic>Mayetiola</italic> species are unconventionally conserved among family members (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2015</xref>), which prevent correct assembly of short sequence reads obtained from a high-throughput sequencing approach (for example, Illumina sequencing). More comprehensive studies should lead to the identification of more conserved and unique SSGPs from barley midge and oat midge.</p><p>In summary, we conducted transcriptomics analyses on genes expressed in the salivary glands of first instars of the barley midge and oat midge for the first time. Our analyses have identified many putative effectors that are produced in the saliva of these two species. When putative effectors from barley midge and oat midge were compared to those from Hessian fly, many of them were conserved among the three midges, indicating conserved roles that are likely associated with feeding mechanisms. We have also identified many putative effectors that are unique to each midge. We postulate that some of these unique effectors might play roles in host specification. Identification of conserved and unique putative effector genes provides a foundation for further characterization for the roles of these genes in gall midges&#x02013;host plant interactions. We believe that getting insight about the functions of these effectors could be useful to reveal feeding mechanisms of these destructive pests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s13"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>Journal of Insect Science</italic> online.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup2"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s2.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup3"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s3.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup4"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s4.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup5"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s5.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup6"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary-table_s6.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup7"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary_figure_s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup8"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary_figure_s2.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup9"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary_figure_s3.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup10"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary_figure_s4.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup11"><label>Supplementary Figure 5</label><media xlink:href="iey094_suppl_supplementary_figure_s5.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The research is joint effort between USDA-ARS and Kansas State University.
