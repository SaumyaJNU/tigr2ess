    "Plasma treatment is recognized as a suitable technology to improve germination efficiency of numerous seeds. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate whether cold air plasma can change the quality and quantity of wheat yield. Effects of cold plasma treatment on wheat (Pishgam variety) yield were studied by a randomized complete block design experiment at the Faculty of Agriculture of Tarbiat Modarres University, Iran, during 2015-17. Seeds were pre-treated with 80 W of cold plasma at four levels of time, 60, 120, 180 and 240 seconds. Plasma effects on yield and quality of wheat were determined by measuring plant photosynthesis, grain yield, biological yield, 1000-grain weight, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin, protein and starch content. Results showed that plasma treatments had positive effects on wheat characteristics, and treatment of 180 s had the highest stimulatory effect. In both years, cold plasma increased grain yield at 180 s, but decreased it at 240 s compared with control. The rate of plant photosynthesis, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, carotenoid and anthocyanin were enhanced at 180 s. The starch content and grain protein were enhanced at 120 s cold plasma application compared with control."
