In the United states alone, 670,000 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year. Heart failure is the fastest-growing clinical cardiac disease burden in the United States, affecting 2% of the population, accounting for 34% of cardiovascular-related deaths, and representing 1&#x02013;2% (~$40 billion) of all health care expenditures. Fourteen percent of the Medicare population has HF but they take up a disproportionate amount of Medicare dollars using ~43% of Medicare expenditures [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>].</p><p>Heart failure is a condition that results from the heart&#x02019;s inability to maintain sufficient cardiac output to meet the metabolic demands of the body. It can be acute or chronic in nature, it can affect either side of the heart and it can be systolic or diastolic. Persistent cardiac pressure overload induces hypertrophy and pathological tissue remodeling, which leads to loss of heart function and often heart failure and death. The progression of cardiac hypertrophy represents the principal risk factor for the development of heart failure and subsequent cardiac death [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Cardiac hypertrophy is classically considered to be an adaptive and compensatory response that increases the work output of cardiomyocytes and thus maintains cardiac function despite increased load. Increased resistance, created by pathology such as hypertension or by the aortic constriction technique we use in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, initially compromises left ventricular (LV) function. Subsequently the development of LV hypertrophy begins to restore systolic function, and concentric LV hypertrophy develops, which increases the LV mass. A decline in LV function accompanies LV chamber dilation, apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis and tissue remodeling, which results in eventual heart failure and death [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. Heart failure can result in forced dependency, depression, and the inability to perform activities of daily living. The result of this is most often a drastic reduction in quality of life. There is a need for new drugs that address HF: We need to improve clinical outcomes, specifically maintaining heart function in patients suffering from heart failure, and reducing mortality. As part of a disease management program, such an agent would reduce readmission rates. New targets are needed because extant therapies are not adequately addressing these needs.</p><p>The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) is an ionotropic nonselective cation channel, initially identified in peripheral sensory neurons and found widespread in the cardiovascular system [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Studies have implicated the role of endogenous activator anandamide (ANA) in multiple cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and hypertension [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. Elevated TRPV1 expression is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in mice, and functional knockout of TRPV1 protected heart function in a model of cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. Furthermore, we have shown that administration of a TRPV1 antagonist can overcome loss of heart function [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. TRPV1 appears to be important in heart failure by virtue of the fact that its genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition rescues cardiac hypertrophy in the mouse and that an endogenous activator (anandamide) has been implicated in in multiple cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and hypertension. TRPV1 is expressed in cardiac myocytes [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>], but we understand relatively little of the potential regulatory coupling of TRPV1 to pathways that control heart physiology, and the longitudinal impact of TRPV1 inhibition in heart health under conditions of applied pathology has some attendant controversies.</p><p>Therapeutic or genetic hyperstimulation of guanosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) synthesis counteracts these pathologies [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. Here, we show that the TRPV1 ion channel (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1), is a component of the natriuretic peptide A, cGMP, PKG signaling complex. It interacts with the natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1, guanylyl cyclase-A), and upon binding its ligand, natriuretic peptide A (NPPA, ANP) is subsequently suppressed through production of cGMP and PKG mediated phosphorylation. We also show that oral administration of selective TRPV1 antagonists, suppresses chamber and myocyte hypertrophy, and longitudinally reverses pre-established loss of heart function <italic>in vivo</italic>, in mice exposed to chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction. This effect is similar to treatment with the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor Sildenafil, and offers a mechanism of action for the efficacy of sildenafil in heart failure; where TRPV1 is a target for the down-stream PKG phosphorylation resulting from the elevated cGMP levels that result from PDE inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>The Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 1 interacts with TRPV1</title><p>Expression data and prior <italic>in vivo</italic> studies suggest that that TRPV1 is ideally positioned to receive stimuli that regulates hypertensive signaling, and thus protect the heart from cardiac hypertrophy [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. Interaction trap data using the intracellular TRPV1 amino and carboxy-termini as bait (not shown) was examined for potential regulators of TRPV1 in a cardiovascular context, and suggested that TRPV1 interacts with the natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (NPR1, GC-A), a receptor guanylate cyclase [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. This receptor binds the Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), the major physiological antagonist of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). This observation led us to propose a testable model (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Here we hypothesize that there is a functional physiological interaction between the ion channel TRPV1, and the ANP receptor (NPR1); which upon stimulation causes an inhibitory phosphorylation of TRPV1 via cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) stimulation.<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336950.2018.1547611-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic model of TRPV1 interacting with NPR1.</p><p specific-use="attrib">Our proposed model shows TRPV1 directly interacting with NPR1, which upon stimulation with ANP produces cGMP from GTP, which in turn stimulates PKG phosphorylation of TRPV1, and gating inhibition.

The specificity of the ANP receptor (NPR1, GC-A) antibody was first confirmed as follows: A FLAG-tagged NPR1 cDNA was transfected into HEK293 cells. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates a 120 kDa protein corresponding to FLAG-NPR1 that is detected by the NPR1 and FLAG antibodies (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>)). The same FLAG-tagged protein was also detected in lysates by both the FLAG and NPR1 antibodies (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>)). In <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) the overexpression of TRPV1 resulted in high over-expression which may lead to non-physiological binding and dysregulated post-translational modification which reads as smears under our Western conditions. TRPV1 expression proved hard to control and so after these initial experiments we moved towards establishing functional relevance of the putative interaction.<fig id="F0002" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336950.2018.1547611-F0002</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>TRPV1 co-immunoprecipitates with NPR1, and is PKG phosphorylated.</p><p specific-use="attrib">(a) The anti-NPR1 antibody specifically immunoprecipitates the NPR1 protein. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-NPR1 construct or a pcDNA control vector.

Left panel shows immunoprecipitated FLAG-TRPV1 protein from non-induced and induced (1&#x003bc;g/ml for 16h) HEK293-FLAG-TRPV1 cells. Right panels show that induction of the cell line produces a capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 calcium response in single cell Fura-2 assays. (c) TRPV1 interacts with the ANP receptor NPR1. HEK293-FLAG-TRPV1 cells were treated with tetracycline (1&#x003bc;g/ml for 16h) to induce expression of the FLAG-TRPV1 protein. Lysates were prepared (1x10<sup>7</sup> cells per lane) and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies or acetone precipitated to recover total protein.

ANP causes a marked increase in the levels of TRPV1 captured by anti-phospho PKG substrate antibody, indicating enhanced PKG-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1.</p></caption><graphic content-type="black-white" xlink:href="kchl-13-01-1547611-g002"/></fig>
</p><p>To test co-immunoprecipitation, we used an HEK293 cell line that functionally expresses a FLAG epitope-tagged version of TRPV1 under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive transcriptional repressor. FLAG-TRPV1 is inducibly over-expressed by addition of tetracycline to the growth media, (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(b</xref>)-left panel) and functions to allow calcium influx into the cells upon stimulation with the TRPV1 ligand capsaicin (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(b</xref>) Right panel). Anti-FLAG and Anti-NPR1 antibodies both immunoprecipitate a protein corresponding to TRPV1 that is detected by anti-FLAG antibody (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2c</xref>). Immunoprecipitation by anti-NPR1 of the FLAG-reactive protein indicates that TRPV1 protein interacts with the ANP receptor, NPR1, supporting one aspect of the proposed model (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Binding of ANP to NPR1 causes phosphorylation of TRPV1 via cGMP/PKG</title><p>NPR1 is a guanylate cyclase, catalyzing the conversion of GMP to cyclic GMP (cGMP) [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. We sought to understand whether the production of cGMP that follows ANP binding to NPR1 has any functional consequences for the activity of TRPV1, as per our model (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). We stimulated the FLAG-TRPV1 HEK293 cell line with vehicle or ANP, confirming that upon stimulation for one minute or more, cGMP concentration was significantly increased many fold over control, indicating the presence of functional NPR1 in the FLAG-TRPV1 HEK293 cell line (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(d</xref>)). PKG is the major cellular target for the actions of cGMP, and previously published data has shown that another cyclic-nucleotide regulated kinase, PKA, affects TRPV1 [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>], we asked whether TRPV1 is a substrate for PKG in our model system. In <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(e</xref>), PKG phosphorylated substrate proteins were immunoprecipitated from untreated, and ANP-treated, FLAG-TRPV1 HEK293 cell lysates, using an anti-phosho-PKG substrate antibody. TRPV1 was represented in the PKG substrate proteins, and quantitatively more TRPV1 was immunoprecipitated via the anti-phospho-PKG substrate motif antibody from lysates derived from ANP-treated cells. These data suggest that TRPV1 is a PKG substrate, and is phosphorylated upon NPR1 ligation by ANP, as per our model.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2003"><title>cGMP/PKG regulates the function of TRPV1</title><p>Since we propose that TRPV1 activation regulates calcium-dependent cellular events, and ANP is the primary physiological antagonist to the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>], we asked whether the ANP/PKG/NPR1 pathway would act to oppose the activation of TRPV1. Ratio-metric calcium imaging was undertaken, utilizing a cell-permeable cGMP analog with a greater resistance to hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases than cGMP, and which activates the PKG cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Cells expressing TRPV1 were exposed to increasing concentrations of 8-bromoguanosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cyclic monophosphate, after which capsaicin was applied, and TRPV1&#x000a0;mediated calcium entry observed as an increase in the Fura2-AM die ratio.

ANP, and the cGMP signaling it initiates, are suppressive influences on TRPV1 activation. ANP is synthesized, and secreted by cardiac myocytes in the atrial walls of the heart, which is released in response to atrial distension and serves to maintain sodium homeostasis and inhibit activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Circulating atrial natriuretic peptide is greatly increased in congestive heart failure as a result of increased synthesis and release of ANP. This is particularly important in the vasculature, where vascular smooth muscle will bind ANP released as a result of increasing right atrial pressure and will cause the walls of the vasculature to relax. This relaxation decreases peripheral resistance, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces the preload and resulting in the heart having to do less work [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>].

It was initially identified in peripheral sensory neurons and later found to be widespread in the cardiovascular system [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. TRPV1 appears to be important in the heart by virtue of the fact that its genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition rescues cardiac hypertrophy in the mouse [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. TRPV1 is expressed in cardiac myocytes [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>], but as we started the current study we understood relatively little of the potential regulatory coupling of TRPV1 to pathways that control heart physiology, and the longitudinal impact of TRPV1 inhibition in heart health under conditions of applied pathology had not been explored. In the current paper we show that TRPV1 interacts with the natriuretic peptide receptor 1, NPR1, and that activation of NPR1 with the atrial natriuretic peptide pathway causes cGMP stimulated PKG phosphorylation of TRPV1, causing an inhibition of TRPV1 activation and reduced surface currents. We also show that orally available TRPV1 antagonists can reverse the loss of function associated with heart failure, in an <italic>in vivo</italic> pressure overload model of heart failure. Our data also show that this rescued function can be maintained longitudinally with continued drug treatment.</p><p>These data place TRPV1 as component of the atrial natriuretic peptide/PKG signaling system, which is central to volume control in the heart. There are established connections between cGMP, PKG and heart health [<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. ANP is produced in cardiomyocytes of the atrial wall, which contain volume receptors that are stretch-responsive. Knockout of the ANP receptor, NPR1, has been shown to be protective in cardiac hypertrophy, improving outcomes, with NPR1 knockout experiments effectively evidencing the existence of an ANP/NPR1 anti-hypertrophic pathway in the heart [<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>]. Here we show that ANP/NPR1/PKG leads to regulatory phosphorylation of TRPV1, and since TRPV1 KO, like that of NPR1 is antagonistic to hypertrophy, we can assume this is a negative regulatory phosphorylation and that TRPV1 activity and function are involved in hypertrophic processes [<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>]. Thus the ANP/NPR1/cGMP/PKG/TRPV1 linkage, which is novel, provides a target and effector molecule (TRPV1) for the anti-hypertrophic effects of ANP/NPR1. Open questions still remain, however, including clarification of the effect of PKG phosphorylation on TRPV1 (soluble Guanylate Cyclase/PKG. An NO-regulated PKG pathway does negatively regulate TRPV1 via PKG phosphorylation and our data now support a negative regulatory NPR1/PKG/TRPV1 phosphorylation, but overall the effects of PKG phosphorylation on TRPV1 are less well studied than those of PKA and PKC [<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of these studies is the fact that future experiments need to use ANP as an applied ligand, in whole cell patch clamp, measure that there is an effect in terms of an increase in a potentially short-lived cGMP flux and then assess impact on TRPV1 currents or the resulting calcium fluxes. The experiments showing 8-bromo cGMP inhibition of TRPV1 responses would benefit from addition of a washout step in future studies. A further limitation is the need to demonstrate a native NPR1-TRPV1 complex, possibly by FRET or co-IP. While these two proteins are indeed co-expressed in cardiomyocytes, the regulation of TRPV1 via NPR1-generated cGMP does not necessarily require NPR1 and TRPV1 to be physically co-associated in a complex [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Our data suggesting interaction in an overexpression system needs to be followed up to establish if the physical association is a component of the regulatory pathway.</p><p>The second major finding of the present report is the longitudinal impact of TRPV1 inhibition on heart health under conditions of applied pathology. Here we show that TRPV1 antagonists can reverse the loss of function associated with heart failure, in the in vivo pressure overload model of heart failure. Moreover, this restoration of function can be maintained longitudinally with continued drug treatment. These findings are of potential clinical significance and are open to rapid translation given the extensive TRPV1 pharmacopeia that has been developed for pain therapy. Of course, these findings need to be extended beyond murine models, but we note that the effect of TRPV1 antagonism on functional recovery could be much greater in the human clinical situation, in which there is not a continued surgically produced aortic constriction and pressure overload applied. In humans therefore, there may be the opportunity to recover to an actually improved ejection fraction, higher than the initially identified symptomatic disease state.</p><p>One of the intriguing questions arising from our studies is the identity of the cell types that might contain functional TRPV1 and effect protection in the context of heart failure [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0057">57</xref>]. As our data is generated in an in vivo model that effects systemic inhibition of TRPV1 during heart failure progression, the exact combination of cell and tissue type cannot be pinned down. We hypothesize however that a major cell type effected is most likely cardiomyocytes. TRPV1, along with TRPA1, expression has been shown localized to z-discs, costameres and intercalated discs in cardiac muscle [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>], as well as being functionally regulated in cultured cardiomyocytes, where its activation increased cell size and elevated expression of atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA and intracellular calcium [<xref rid="CIT0057">57</xref>].</p><p>The data presented here provides new possibilities in the treatment and reversal of heart failure, and further hope for patient survival and life extension. TRPV1 is a focus of multiple drug discovery efforts in both pre-clinical and clinical stages [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0058">58</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0059">59</xref>]. The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin is used as a treatment for pain through its effect in desensitization of TRPV1 channels in neurons [<xref rid="CIT0060">60</xref>]. Since the therapeutic goal in both pain, and hypertrophy, is to decrease TRPV1 activity, then either direct antagonism or indirect suppression through agonism and desensitization could be viable approaches. Early TRPV1 agonists showed adverse effects during clinical development including mild hyperthermia and impaired noxious heat sensation, impairing their progression to the clinic as analgesics. However, in the context of imminent heart failure, mild hyperthermia might be viewed as an acceptable side effect. Moreover, at least seven later generation TRPV1 compounds that are orally active have progressed into clinical development with reduced side effect profiles [<xref rid="CIT0059">59</xref>].
