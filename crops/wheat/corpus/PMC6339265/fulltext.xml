CFTR consists of two transmembrane-spanning domains (TMD1 and TMD2), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and an intrinsically disordered regulatory region (R). CFTR domains mostly fold co-translationally (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kleizen et al, 2005</xref>) and need extensive domain assembly to form a fully functional chloride channel.</p><p>To date, more than 1,800 mutations have been identified in the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genet.sickkids.on.ca">http://genet.sickkids.on.ca</ext-link>). Most of these are not well characterized; therefore, the CFTR2 database on CF-causing variants was created (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Sosnay et al, 2013</xref>). The initial version of CFTR2 contained 159 mutations, which account for 96% of all CF patients. Mutations in CF can be divided into six different classes: (i) defective synthesis of full-length protein, (ii) defective protein processing and trafficking, leading to retention in the ER and degradation, (iii) defective channel opening (gating), (iv) reduced chloride permeability, (v) reduced synthesis of CFTR protein, or (vi) reduced cell-surface stability (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Welsh &#x00026; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Castellani et al, 2008</xref>). This classification system is outdated because mutants can belong to multiple classes (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Veit et al, 2016</xref>). An example of this is CFTR-F508del, a typical class-II mutant, which even when reaching the cell surface does not function properly and shows class-III and class-VI characteristics.</p><p>Clinical drugs targeting CFTR are divided into two types. The so-called correctors increase cell-surface expression by improving release from the ER (for instance by improving folding) and often also by increasing stability at the cell surface (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pedemonte et al, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Compounds that improve channel function at the cell surface are called potentiators (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Patients with class-III and class-IV mutations (R117H, R117C, G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, and S549R, and several others) now have FDA approval to be treated with the potentiator VX-770. For a wide range of common patient mutations, VX-770 treatment improves CFTR function (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2014</xref>).</p><p>CFTR needs to obtain the proper conformation during the folding process to become a functional anion channel at the cell surface. Treatments with drugs or other small molecules aim to change the conformation in mutated proteins to a state where these can function at least partially. Understanding the functional and folding defects in CFTR mutants is crucial to better predict which drug (combination) provides the best precision medicine for CF treatment. CFTR function as measured by sweat-chloride concentration in CF patients correlates well with CFTR function in organoids derived from those patients (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Noordhoek et al, 2016</xref>). The forskolin-induced swelling assay (FIS) is used to measure CFTR function in patient-derived organoids and is also used to interrogate individual responses to drug treatments (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most CFTR2 class-IV mutants are impaired in the formation of the pore that allows passage of anions (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mornon et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Linsdell, 2017</xref>). R117C/H, R334W, and R347P class-IV mutants all have a lower overall chloride current but for different reasons (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard et al, 1993</xref>). R117H features reduced open probability (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al, 2016</xref>), whereas R347P gates like wild-type but has a conductance below 30% of wild-type levels, and R334W has either a very low conductance or diminished open probability (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard et al, 1993</xref>). R117 is important for maintaining the open channel (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al, 2014</xref>). The presence of many positively charged residues in the pore of CFTR suggests their involvement in chloride permeation. R334 has been implicated in interacting with anions at the mouth of the pore (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al, 2001</xref>), whereas R347 forms a salt bridge that is important for maintaining an open channel (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cotten &#x00026; Welsh, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al, 2013</xref>).</p><p>R117C, R117H, and R334W mutant CFTR proteins are exported from the ER with efficiencies of 49, 165, and 98% of wild-type, respectively (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2014</xref>). By sharp contrast, R347P matures very inefficiently to &#x0223c;15% of wild-type (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2014</xref>). All the previously described mutants, however, have been re-classified as mixed class-II/III/IV (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Veit et al, 2016</xref>). To address the discrepancy between the 50% or higher maturation efficiency and the re-classifications, we revisited the functional properties and folding characteristics of the most common class-IV mutations in the original CFTR2 database. We investigated the folding&#x02013;function relationship of R117C/H, R334W, and R347P using the FIS assay in organoids, intestinal current measurements (ICMs), and radiolabeling coupled to a protease-sensitivity assay of newly synthesized CFTR. We confirmed that R347P is not a &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; class-IV mutation. Because of its defective function and a misfolded conformation, it more closely resembled a class-II mutation. Folding of the other class-IV mutants was similar, yet not identical to that of wild-type, explaining some differences between them and documenting the strength of biochemical approaches in combination with functional studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>R347P lacks residual function</title><p>To explore CFTR function of the class-IV mutants, we used ICM in Ussing chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1</xref>). We obtained rectal biopsies of heterozygous CF patients carrying one R117H, R347P, or E730X allele with the F508del mutation on the second allele and a R334W/R746X genotype. When CFTR is functioning properly, intestinal current measurements yield a positive deflection in the short-circuit current (Isc), reflecting electrogenic anion (mainly chloride) secretion. In the continuous presence of the sodium-channel blocker amiloride, elevation of intracellular cAMP by forskolin or IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) triggered a large CFTR-mediated anion secretory current in rectal biopsies from healthy controls and from R117H/F508del individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1B and E</xref>), which was reduced in R334W/R746X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>) and severely blunted in biopsies of R347P/F508del patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>). E730X/F508del biopsies even yielded a downward deflection, suggesting a net K<sup>+</sup> secretion with little to no CFTR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D</xref>). CFTR potentiators VX-770 and/or genistein, in the presence of saturating intracellular cAMP levels, did not further enhance CFTR-mediated anion secretion above the level induced by forskolin/IBMX. By contrast, the calcium-linked secretagogue carbachol further increased the Isc, the magnitude of the response proportional to the cAMP response. Carbachol acts mainly through activation of basolateral K<sup>+</sup> channels, membrane hyperpolarization, and enhancement of the electrical driving force for chloride exit through the CFTR channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A&#x02013;E</xref>). Again, the response was severely blunted in R347P/F508del biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>R347P is inactive.</title><p>ICM measurements of human rectal biopsies of tissues, which were treated with indicated compounds. <bold>(A)</bold> Tracing of an R347P/F508del patient showing no response upon forskolin/IBMX addition.

Forskolin-induced activation of CFTR causes swelling of the organoids, which we then exploit as a readout for CFTR residual function. The outcomes of ICM and FIS measurements correlate well (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">de Winter-de Groot et al, 2018</xref>), even though each patient-derived organoid is unique and each patient may respond differently to drug treatment (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Noordhoek et al, 2016</xref>). CF patients have two mutated alleles for the CFTR protein and functional activity depends on the type of mutation on each allele. Consequently, in patient-derived material, both mutants likely are co-expressed, which formally complicates analysis of how individual mutations respond to drugs in the organoid system, analyzed in FIS and ICM assays. To correct for the contribution of the F508del allele, we subtracted half of the average swelling response obtained from eight reference F508del/F508del patients (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2016</xref>). Although EC50 values would be the preferred parameters to rate drug effects by, this assay does not allow their reliable calculation because CFTR mutants with low functionality respond so poorly to forskolin that a plateau is never reached, whereas wild-type CFTR and active mutants easily saturate the assay and plateau at &#x0223c;3,200 AUC (Area Under the Curve) units because further swelling is not possible, leading to an underestimate of the EC50. When further swelling would be possible, the plateau would rise, moving the apparent EC50 to the right. The maximized swelling in the FIS assay, therefore, precludes proper readout of the EC50.</p><p>R347P/F508del was the only class-IV heterozygote that failed to give an appreciable functional response without modulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). Importantly, preincubation of the organoids with VX-809 rescued R347P/F508del functionally, suggesting that it needs a corrector to either reach the cell surface or function at this location. Acute addition of VX-770 had similar effects as VX-809, but the strongest response of R347P/F508del was seen with both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). Correction for the F508del allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A'</xref>) clearly showed that the effect of VX-770 on the function of R347P is minimal and similar to that obtained with the vehicle control. This showed that the R347P allele can be rescued by VX-809 but not by VX-770 even when combined with VX-809.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>R347P is functionally unresponsive to VX-770.</title><p>Organoids of different patients were treated with an increasing concentration of forskolin, and swelling was measured after 60 min. <bold>(A)</bold> Nontreated R347P/F508del organoids showed a low amount of swelling, indicative for reduced CFTR function.

The R117H/F508del curve in the presence of modulators nears that of organoids from healthy controls (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2016</xref>). The apparent negative effect of VX-809 may be due to the subtraction procedure overestimating the contribution of the F508del allele in this specific patient sample. The F508del/E730X organoid was relatively inert to VX-809 and VX-770 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that the F508del allele in this patient gained little function even upon combination of modulators. Patients with the same genotype, however, can differ in disease phenotype and this specific patient could have low residual function (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekkers et al, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pranke et al, 2017</xref>). We concluded that the class-IV mutations on one allele contributed significantly to the swelling of organoids derived from these patients.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Transport of R347P to the Golgi complex is impaired</title><p>Unlike the other tested class-IV mutants, R347P did not show appreciable residual function in the ICM and FIS assays.

Because limited proteolysis of R347P yielded some TMD1, NBD1, TMD2, and NBD2 fragments that were completely absent in F508del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>), we concluded that R347P was slightly better folded than F508del. Protease susceptibility of R347P's TMD1 was different in two ways: not only less of each fragment but also slightly larger fragments were generated than with wild-type CFTR. All fragments except T1a had a slightly lower mobility on SDS-PA gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, TMD1b-f) because the amino-acid change affected the mobility of each R347P-containing fragment (our unpublished observations).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Most class-IV mutants respond to VX-770 conformationally</title><p>We then assessed the biochemical effects of VX-770 and VX-809 on the class-IV mutants and established whether improvement of abnormal folding could explain the outcomes of the functional experiments. Addition of VX-770 did not affect the synthesis of wild-type CFTR or any of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, left panel). Whereas it slightly decreased the transport to the Golgi of some mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>, right panel), steady-state CFTR levels were not affected by 3 &#x003bc;M VX-770 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Limited proteolysis of the 2-h chase samples followed by immunoprecipitation with the TMD1 antibody showed, however, that VX-770 slightly destabilized the N terminus of TMD1 of wild-type and the R117 and R334 mutants, as the three late fragments, T1d-f, collapsed into the smallest T1d band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>); these fragments only differ at their N terminus (our unpublished observations). In apparent contrast, the approximately twofold increase in signal of the combined T1d-f large fragments in the presence of VX-770 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>) confirmed that VX-770 increased overall TMD1 protease resistance (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al, 2018</xref>). Because folding of R117H, R117C, and R334W were wild-type&#x02013;like in control and VX-770&#x02013;treated samples, we concluded that a gross conformational defect did not account for their reduced chloride transport.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>The folding defect of R347P is rescued by VX-809</title><p>Because VX-809 increased the functional response of R347P and VX-770 had little if any effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>), we investigated whether VX-809 rescued folding of this mutant. The general effect of VX-809 was an increase in quantity of CFTR, of both full-length and protease-resistant fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A&#x02013;C</xref>; B. Kleizen, I. Braakman, unpublished observations; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Okiyoneda et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loo &#x00026; Clarke, 2017</xref>). This strongly suggests that VX-809 helps CFTR fold into a more protease-resistant, stable conformation. VX-809 partially rescued F508del from the ER as seen by the appearance of a Golgi form after a chase as well as the late fragments of TMD1, TMD2, and NBD2 mentioned previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>, right panels). VX-809 did not rescue folding of F508del NBD1 as seen in the immunoprecipitations for NBD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Okiyoneda et al, 2013</xref>). R347P was the only mutant that responded well functionally to VX-809 in the FIS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A and A'</xref>), which correlates with the increased levels of R347P after 15 min of pulse labeling, the improved transport to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>, top panels), and the increased steady-state levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p><p>In nontreated control conditions, limited proteolysis of the R347P mutant yielded minute quantities of late TMD1 fragments. The strong improvement of R347P folding and conformation by VX-809 is demonstrated by the recovery of the late TMD1 fragments, albeit enriched for T1d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). The other domains also gained stability after VX-809 treatment, which hence improved the complete protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>) and its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A and A'</xref>). That VX-809 rescued the R347P mutant more efficiently than F508del was likely caused by its improving TMD1 folding, the domain that contains the R347P mutation and hence the primary defect.</p><p>To assess whether enhanced transport of CFTR variants to the Golgi complex resulted in more molecules reaching the plasma membrane, we used cell-surface biotinylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>, wild-type, R117C/H, and R334W CFTRs have similar cell-surface expression, whereas R347P and F508del CFTRs were barely or not detectable. Plasma membrane expression was increased to a variable extent upon VX-809 treatment (minimally for F508del), whereas VX-770 was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). We next investigated whether R347P CFTR that had been rescued by VX-809 became responsive to VX-770 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>). In agreement with the functional results in the FIS and ICM assays, R347P remained unresponsive to VX-770 even though VX-809 rescued the late fragments from all domains of R347P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>The proline residue in R347P destabilizes TM6</title><p>The reduced stability of R347P is likely due to changes in transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) of TMD1, which contains the mutated residue. The question is whether the loss of the charged amino acid or gain of the proline caused the defect. To establish the role of the proline, we used another disease-causing mutant in which R347 was changed to histidine and designed three additional mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A and B</xref>). A helical wheel representation showed that R347 is embedded in a polypeptide stretch enriched for small hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C</xref>). We, therefore, changed R347 to a valine or leucine, whereas the arginine-to-glutamine was made because glutamine is present at the 347th position in other ABC transporters.</p><p>The protease digestion pattern of the four mutants was similar to that of wild-type CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). Like in R347P, mutation to a glutamine resulted in the upward shift of the T1b-f bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>) because of a small change in mobility of the mutation-containing fragments. The loss of arginine caused a small alteration in late TMD1 fragments of all R347 mutants, with an enrichment of T1d over T1e and T1f compared with wild-type TMD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A and B</xref>). Nevertheless, relative to this minor change, the introduction of a proline residue caused the major folding defects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s10"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we investigated the structure&#x02013;function relationship of the most common class-IV CF-causing CFTR mutants, defining a subgroup of CF patients also known as the altered-chloride-conductance group (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Welsh &#x00026; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Castellani et al, 2008</xref>). CFTR mutants of this class can escape the ER and reach the plasma membrane. Patients with these mutations may benefit from treatment with a single potentiator drug to 'activate' the mutant CFTR protein at the cell surface. Patients carrying class-IV mutations, with the exception of R117H and R117C, do not yet have clinical approval for treatment with the VX-770 potentiator compounds. We addressed the folding characteristics of class-IV CFTR mutants to uncover the underlying mechanism for functional effects of VX-770 and corrector VX-809 treatment in this group and found that all responded and were improved conformationally by VX-809. The corrector improved folding in all mutants but barely affected R334W and R117H function, most likely because their cell-surface levels already are at a maximum, wild-type&#x02013;like level. By contrast, R347P deviated in that it benefitted well from VX-809 (in a manner distinct from F508del CFTR), yet did not have a functional VX-770 response. We have shown that all functional mutants respond to the corrector drug and that R347P responded better to corrector than to potentiator treatment, classifying R347P as bona fide class-II mutant.</p><p>An explanation of the differences between the mutants is greatly facilitated by the recent structure models of CFTR and the cryo-EM structures of CFTR and other ABC transporters, which enable structure-based experimental design and analysis. The &#x0201c;hyperresponse&#x0201d; of R347P to correction is likely caused by VX-809, correcting precisely where the defect is, in TMD1 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loo &#x00026; Clarke, 2017</xref>; our unpublished results). R347P resides in transmembrane helix 6 and the cryo-EM structure of human CFTR shows that TM6 interacts with the N terminus at the elbow helix and packs closely to TM3 and ICL1, the first intracellular loop in TMD1, which interacts through its coupling helix with NBD1 in folded CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al, 2017</xref>). Changing arginine 347 to a proline in TM6 will destabilize the helix and will likely affect the packing of TM6 with ICL1 and the N terminus (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al, 2005</xref>). VX-809 was reported to promote interactions of NBD1 with ICL1 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Loo &#x00026; Clarke, 2017</xref>), and allosterically with ICL4 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hudson et al, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Laselva et al, 2018</xref>), both consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A&#x02013;C</xref>) and our unpublished results (Kleizen &#x00026; Braakman, in preparation). Corrector VX-809 improves packing of TMD1, and thereby rescues interactions with the other domains, in particular NBD1.</p><p>The destabilization of the N terminus of TMD1 was not unique to R347P, as also VX-770 had this effect in our assays. Indeed, the N terminus and ICL1 are affected by VX-770 to some extent (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Byrnes et al, 2018</xref>). We conclude that the amino terminus in R347P is destabilized to such an extent that VX-770 failed to exert a significant effect in the two functional assays. Functional experiments suggest that (heterozygous) R347P patients can benefit from a combination treatment of the two drugs, which was shown to be beneficial to F508del homozygous patients with variable improvements between 4.3 and 6.7% (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wainwright et al, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Even though the introduction of the proline residue caused the strongest defect, the highly conserved arginine does play a key role in maintaining the open pore architecture. R347 makes a salt bridge with aspartate residues in positions 924 and 993 of TMD2 in the open channel (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al, 2013</xref>). Removal of this arginine, therefore, causes reduced function, as in the R347H patient mutant (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cotten &#x00026; Welsh, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2014</xref>). R347V, L, and Q CFTR also folded wild-type&#x02013;like, but the subtle change in TMD1 as reflected by the enrichment of the T1d-fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A and B</xref>) suggests a subtle conformational defect at the N terminus, consistent with the subtle functional defect of R347H CFTR (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cotten &#x00026; Welsh, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Van Goor et al, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Other class-IV mutants fold largely like wild-type CFTR albeit with some minor differences. R334 is in ECL3 with its side chain towards TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5E</xref>). This must be a more tolerant part of the molecule because even introduction of a large aromatic residue such as Trp does not grossly perturb folding of the protein. In the open channel structure model (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mornon et al, 2015</xref>), R334 is located close to ECL4 in TMD2, where R334 may have a prominent role in maintaining a stable open form by making a salt bridge with D891 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard et al, 1993</xref>) and in the closed state with E217 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5E and F</xref>).</p><p>The lack of differences between wild-type CFTR and the R117 mutants suggested that the gross conformation of the channel is not altered. R117 is in the first extracellular loop (ECL1) of TMD1 at the beginning of TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D and F</xref>) and creates or stabilizes the open channel through a salt bridge with E1126 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard et al, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et al, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al, 2016</xref>).
