Multiple types of differences in the information content of DNA molecules, from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large-scale structural variation, form part of natural genetic variation that can cause phenotypic variation [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Distinguishing such <italic>bona fide</italic> variation from apparent variation generated by sequence and assembly methods is therefore a critically important activity in genomics.</p><p>Sequence assemblies are generally incomplete and contain multiple types of errors, reducing their information content. Gaps in assemblies can occur where no sequence reads were generated for that region, but this is now increasingly unlikely given the very deep coverage achievable by short read sequencing, improved sequence chemistry, and template preparation methods that avoid bias, such as that introduced by PCR [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Closely related repetitive DNA sequences can lead to incorrect joins in assemblies or to an unresolvable assembly graph that breaks an assembly. Assemblies can be either joined or broken inadvertently by closely related or polymorphic sequences that cause alternate, multiple, or collapsed assemblies, for example in assemblies of polyploid genomes [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Errors and incompleteness can also obscure important genomic information such as the correct order (phasing) of sequence variants.</p><p>A broad spectrum of sequence and assembly artefacts can be distinguished from natural sequence variation, structural variants identified, and sequence variation phased, using long-range sequence information. Sequences of long single molecules generated by PacBio Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) and Nanopore technologies are increasingly used for <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Linked read technologies such as 10xGenomics reads also have great promise for long-range ordering of scaffolds assembled from short reads, for defining extended haplotypes, and for identifying structural variation [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Chromatin interaction frequency data are also used to position sequence scaffolds into larger chromosome-scale pseudomolecular assemblies [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while optical and genetic maps provide complementary ways of assessing chromosome-scale pseudomolecule assemblies [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, assessing sequence assemblies across smaller scales (100&#x02013;1,000 kb) remains an essential task, as such local assembly errors can be propagated into larger pseudomolecule-scale alignments.</p><p>These improvements in sequencing and assembly are enabling the creation of genomic resources for very large and complex genomes, including those of grasses and gymnosperm trees, which have massive repetitive DNA tracts comprising about 80% of their genomes. The 22-Gb genome of loblolly pine (<italic>Pinus taeda</italic>), initially assembled from Illumina paired end sequence reads [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], has been significantly improved using SMRT sequencing [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 10xGenomics linked reads were used to generate an 8-fold increase in scaffold NG50 sizes of sugar pine (<italic>P. lambertiana</italic>) genome assemblies to nearly 2 Mb [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) has a large 15-Gb allohexaploid genome comprising three closely related and separately maintained A, B, and D genomes [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-based physical maps of flow-sorted chromosomes have been made to avoid misassembly of the separate genomes [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A 790-Mb tiling path of BACs from chromosome 3B has been sequenced and assembled [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and represents the most complete available chromosome-scale assembly of wheat to date. Whole genome shotgun (WGS) [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] purified chromosome sequencing [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] approaches to wheat genome assembly have also been taken, but these assemblies were very fragmentary and incomplete. Recently a new approach to template preparation and assembly generated separate assemblies of the A, B, and D genomes, but although more complete, these remain quite fragmentary [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A near-complete and highly contiguous assembly of Illumina paired-end and mate-pair reads from wild emmer wheat (WEW, <italic>Triticum turgidum ssp dicoccoides</italic>), a tetraploid progenitor of bread wheat, has also recently been published [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting this approach also has promise for sequencing hexaploid wheat genomes. Finally, long SMRT sequence reads integrated with Illumina sequence coverage increased the size and contiguity of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a diploid wheat progenitor [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and hexaploid wheat genome assemblies [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is therefore timely to assess the extent of different assembly error types in each of these different tetraploid and hexaploid wheat assemblies.</p><p>Generating accurate genome assemblies is essential for identifying haplotypes selected by breeders and for mapping large-scale structural variation contributing to agronomic performance [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, assessing the fidelity of wheat sequence assemblies generated by different strategies using a common approach is important for both determining optimal sequencing and assembly strategies and for identifying structural variation. Here we use very long, 40-kb mate-paired sequences of wheat fosmid clones to assess three different wheat whole genome assemblies and two BAC-based wheat chromosome assemblies. Our analyses have identified a range of error types in all assemblies and identify more optimal approaches to wheat genome assembly. We also integrated fosmid end-sequences into whole genome assembly scaffolds and substantially increased scaffold sizes of both fragmentary and more contiguous assemblies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Creating and assessing a wheat fosmid clone library</title><p>Fosmid clone libraries have been used to assess genome assemblies and identify structural variation in human [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and pine genomes [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fosmids are used because DNA is cloned in a precise range of 38 &#x000b1; 3 kb by efficient packaging in phage lambda and cohesive end circularisation. Fosmid clone inserts have been converted to Illumina sequencing templates to generate 38-Kb mate-pair &#x0201c;jumping libraries&#x0201d; and used to improve assemblies of the mouse genome [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In genomes with extensive tracts of very similar repeats and with closely-related homoeologous chromosomes that have been challenging to assemble, fosmid jumping libraries could provide an independent means to assess the fidelity of different wheat genome assemblies and to improve them. In particular, precisely spaced 38-kb paired sequences can identify a range of local assembly errors over scales that include current contig and scaffold sizes of wheat BAC and WGS assemblies.</p><p>To explore the potential of fosmid jumping libraries for assessing and improving different tetraploid and hexaploid wheat sequence assemblies, we first carried out a simulation of WGS assembly of three long 3.5- to 4.1-Mb scaffolds of wheat chromosome 3B generated by sequencing and assembling a manually curated physical map of BACs [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Simulation settings used different paired-end distances, read lengths, and sequence coverage on faux reads from chromosome 3B to assess how read-depth and read-length of 38-Kb mate-paired reads contributed to re-assembly of wheat scaffolds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 1</xref>). Addition of 38-Kb mate-pair reads was required for accurate and complete reconstruction of all three scaffolds under simulation conditions. Paired-end read lengths between 100 and 250 bp were then assessed using a common combination of mate-pair distances and sequence coverage. Reads of &#x0003e;200 bp were required for consistent re-assembly of all three scaffolds. Finally, simulation of sequence coverage of 38-kb mate-pair reads 250 bp long showed that consistent re-assembly of all three scaffolds required sequence coverage of at least 0.75x (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 1</xref>). Taken together, these simulations showed that 38-Kb , paired-end, 250-bp reads with a sequence coverage of approximately 0.75x (&#x0003e;50x physical coverage, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 2</xref>) could be used to guide and assess assemblies of the wheat genome.</p><p>The Fosill vector system was developed for converting fosmid clones to Illumina paired-end read templates [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We modified this Fosill conversion protocol to generate long paired-end, 250-bp Illumina reads to maximise library complexity and to minimise clonal- and PCR-based amplification bias. Both of these modifications were required to maximise unique matches of paired-end reads to the highly repetitive polyploid wheat genome and to maximise sequence coverage of the large genome. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 2</xref> describes modified protocols for library preparation and paired-end read analyses. These involved increasing the time of nick-translation to between 50-60 minutes on ice to generate inverse PCR products with a peak size distribution of 785&#x02013;860 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 2</xref>). This minimised overlap of 250-bp reads from either end of the PCR product. For each pool of 5&#x02013;10 M Fosill clones, a small sample of the circularised template was amplified for up to 16 cycles, and the minimum number of cycles required (generally 12&#x02013;13) to generate sufficient template for sequencing was estimated.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 2</xref> summarises the Fosill libraries produced and the paired-end sequences generated from them. Paired-end reads that overlapped each other on the template were discarded (2.61%), while 11.91% of the raw reads were excluded after vector/adapter sequence and quality trimming. The final number of 576-M paired-end sequences (85.5% of the total reads) were generated from 54.61-M Fosill clones (1.8x sequence coverage, 138x physical coverage). These were then mapped to the chromosome 3B pseudomolecule to measure the insert size distribution of the libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 3</xref>). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref> shows the size distribution of 588,268 mapped read pairs, which had a mean estimated insert size of approximately 37,725 bp. This is the expected insert size range in the Fosill4 vector [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and demonstrated successful size selection during packaging. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref> shows the distribution of mate-pairs mapped in 100-kb windows across chromosome 3B BAC pseudomolecule. Reads with a depth of &#x02033;5 covered 494 Mb of the total 833-Mb chromosome, accounting for 59% of the chromosome sequence. Their even distribution across the pseudomolecule indicated that the libraries were representative of the entire chromosome. There were approximately 30 distinct peaks of greatly increased read-depth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>) in the 100-kb windows across chromosome 3B. These probably correspond to mate-pairs spanning approximately 40-Kb repeated regions common to multiple genomic loci. These reads account for 80% of the alignments but covered only 4.3% of chromosome 3B. For all subsequent analyses, only Fosill mate-pairs of sequence depth &#x0003c;=5 were used. Finally, reads that mapped to multiple locations, which lacked a paired read in the expected genomic location or which had a paired read in the incorrect orientation, were removed.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Determination of Fosill mate-pair distance distributions on chromosome 3B. <bold>A)</bold> 576-M, quality-controlled, paired-end sequences were mapped to the chromosome 3B pseudomolecule.

For assessing assemblies, a windows-based filter was developed to identify sets of &#x02265;5 unique neighbouring Fosill sequence reads in a &#x0201c;driver&#x0201d; window of &#x0003c;10 kb and their &#x02265;5 mate-pair reads in a &#x0201c;follower&#x0201d; window of &#x0003c;20 kb on chromosome and genome assemblies. The vast proportion of mate-paired reads fell within this distance distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 3</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). Using this approach to map Fosill reads, we aimed to identify different types of paired-end matches to genome sequence assemblies. These can be used to identify genome assemblies consistent with the 37.7-Kb mate-pair distances +/- sd, to identify possible new joins between assemblies, and to identify different types of inconsistencies in the range of current publicly available wheat genome assemblies. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref> illustrates the possible types of Fosill paired-end matches to assemblies.</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><p>Using Fosill mate-pair matches to identify discrepancies in wheat chromosome and genome assemblies. <bold>A</bold>) The schematic describes different classes of matches of Fosill mate-pair sequences to wheat chromosome and genome assemblies. Consistent assemblies matched a span of &#x02265;5 mate-pairs in a sliding 10-kb &#x0201c;driver&#x0201d; window that matched their mate in a 20-kb &#x0201c;follower&#x0201d; window at a distance of 37 kb +/- sd in the correct orientation. Where mate-pairs spanned more than 50 kb (approximately 3 sd), this was construed to be due to an aberrant insertion in the underlying assembly. Spans &#x0003c;25 kb (approximately 3 sd) were construed to be due to an aberrant deletion in the assembly. Mis-orientations of the mate-pairs indicated a mis-oriented assembly, and no span a mis-join in the assembly. New joins were also identified.

We also assessed an assembly of hexaploid wheat chromosome 3DL from sequenced BACs in a minimal tiling path using an automated pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 6</xref>). Finally, a set of larger whole genome assemblies of the TGACv1 Illumina wheat genome was also assessed. These assemblies represent diverse approaches to sequencing wheat chromosomes and chromosome arms, including manually curated and automated BAC-based assemblies, two different Illumina-based assembly methods, and a combined Illumina and Pacific Biosciences SMRT assembly of wheat chromosomes.</p><p>Variation in Fosill insert sizes were consistent across the TGACv1, Triticum 3.0, and DeNovo Magic whole genome assemblies of chromosome 3B and the 3DL BAC assemblies. In contrast, chromosome 3B BAC assemblies had a higher variation of insert sizes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1A</xref>). This may be due to a higher proportion of mis-assemblies in the 3B BAC assembly that could have introduced or removed small tracts of sequences, and possibly due to the use of a mixture of 454 and Illumina sequences in the assembly. This variation in Fosill mate-pair matches did not contribute to assessment of assembly accuracy. The accuracy of assemblies was estimated by counting the bases included in correctly sized windows (mean insert size +/-sd) of Fosill mate-pair reads and by the proportion of assemblies/scaffolds that were fully consistent with Fosill mate-pair windows along their length. The un-edited BAC-based scaffolds of chromosome 3DL were the least accurate, with only 17% of the assemblies covered with consistent fossil mate-pair matches, and 57.2% of the sequence included under consistent mate-pair matches (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1A</xref>). The 3B BAC assemblies, which were extensively manually edited, were considerably more accurate, with 66% consistent assemblies and 85.7% of sequences in consistent windows. Looking at the TGACv1 3B assemblies, 61% of scaffolds were consistent and 80.5% of sequences were contained within consistent Fosill windows. In contrast, larger TGACv1 assemblies from the whole genome were all consistent with mate-pair windows, and 98.9% of the sequences were in consistent windows. These differences between TGACv1 3B assemblies are most likely due to the inclusion of many shorter assemblies in the 3B assembly that limit the potential for 38-Kb mate-pair mapping; for example, there will be a low proportion of matches at the ends of assemblies. The Triticum 3.0 WGS assembly of 3B had 92% consistent assemblies and 91% of sequences within consistent Fosill windows. Similarly, the Triticum 3.0 WGS assembly of chromosome 3DL had 99.5% assemblies and 86.2% of sequences in consistent windows. The DeNovo Magic WGS assembly of <italic>T. turgidum</italic> 3B contained 99.6% of sequences in consistent Fosill windows. As these assemblies were integrated into a single pseudomolecule, the measure of the number of correct scaffolds was 100%.</p><p>Four different classes of discrepancies that may be due to assembly problems were assessed using Fosill mate pair mapping to assemblies: failed scaffolding, in which scaffolds had matches to only one end of Fosill end-sequences and which may need to be broken; orientation errors, in which the direction of one region of a scaffold is consistently reversed with respect to flanking regions; insertions, in which the span of Fosill mate-pair matches is greater than expected; and deletions, in which mate-pair spans are less than expected. These results are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>. Of these potential error types, the most frequent were the potential erroneous joining of assemblies. These were highest in the BAC assemblies of hexaploid wheat and lowest in the DenovoMAGIC assembly of WEW 3B. An example of this is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>, where two BAC-based scaffolds were assembled at either end of chromosome 3B. Fosill mapping evidence, supported by TGACv1 assemblies, showed that the two scaffolds can be merged in opposite orientation to that originally assembled. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref> reveals a 12-Kb deletion in a TGACv1 assembly that was due to a missing tandem duplication of the repeat, as validated by comparison with the Triticum 3.0 assembly. An aberrant insertion in a TGACv1 scaffold identified by Fosill mate-pair mapping was also validated by comparison with the Triticum 3.0 assembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>).</p><p>The TGACv1 large assemblies have relatively low numbers of mis-assemblies. The Triticum 3.0 assemblies of both 3B and 3DL had a consistently large number of potential mis-assemblies, with about 400&#x02013;500 per chromosome or chromosome arm, affecting about 10 Mb of sequence region. Potential deletion errors, in which assemblies may be missing sequences, were most frequent in the BAC assembly of chromosome 3B and were also the most frequent type of error in the DenovoMAGIC assembly. Deletions were least frequent in the TGACv1 whole genome assembly. Potential erroneous insertions were less frequent than deletions, with the highest rates of both types of potential error in BAC-based assemblies. In general, potentially erroneous deletions were more common in all assemblies than insertions. Mis-orientations were the rarest potential error type, being most prevalent in manual assembled 3B BAC scaffolds, essentially absent from TGACv1 and Triticum 3.0 assemblies, but more frequent in the DeNovo Magic WEW 3B assembly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Using Fosill mate-pairs to create more contiguous assemblies</title><p>The wheat Fosill library was also used to create new joins in different assemblies. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2A</xref> shows that Fosill mate-pair reads made 267 new links between 477 chromosome 3B BAC scaffolds. Where available, TGACv1 3B assemblies spanning the new links precisely (124 cases), supporting the new join, and no examples were found where the new Fosill joins linked the wrong neighbours or the wrong strand. We then applied the Fosill mate pairs to make new joins in chromosome 3B TGACv1 assemblies and chromosome 3DL BAC assemblies. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2B</xref> shows the total assembly sizes were increased, while the number of scaffolds in the assemblies was decreased and the scaffold n10 more than doubled in size. This showed, as predicted by simulations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), that 38-Kb mate-pair reads can make new links that substantially improve contiguity of both WGS and BAC-based assemblies. Where available, independent assemblies supported these new Fosill-based links. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> shows the distribution of scaffold sizes and numbers before and after Fosill linking on TGACv1 chromosome 3B (panel A) and chromosome 3DL BAC (panel B) assemblies. Increases in the numbers of larger assemblies and concomitant reduction in the numbers of smaller assemblies after Fosill joining was more apparent in the chromosome 3B WGS scaffolds than in the 3DL BAC scaffolds. This may reflect the fewer joins needed in the less fragmentary 3B assembly (2,808 scaffolds) than the very fragmented 3DL assembly (23,433 scaffolds).</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3:</label><caption><p>Increasing assembly contiguity using Fosill matches. <bold>A</bold>) Fosill mate-pair reads were used to link scaffolds of TGACv1 Illumina assemblies from chromosome 3B.

However, its genome has been exceptionally challenging to sequence due to its polyploid composition of three closely related large genomes and extensive tracts of very similar repetitive sequences. Two strategies have been followed to deal with this genomic complexity: the first used BAC clones made from purified chromosomal DNA to reduce the complexity of chromosome-specific assemblies [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; the second set of approaches uses different types of WGS sequence technologies and assembly methods [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. At this stage of wheat genome sequencing, when assemblies from these complementary and contending approaches are available for use, it is timely to assess the accuracy of these different assemblies. For this, we mapped precise 38-kb Fosill long mate-pair reads to measure errors in different assemblies of chromosome 3B and the long arm of chromosome 3DL. We also used these Fosill mate-pair reads to increase whole genome assembly contiguity.</p><p>In order to maximise the accuracy of Fosill mate-pair read mapping to the A, B, or D genomes and to repetitive regions of the hexaploid wheat genome, we modified the template conversion protocol of the Fosill 4 vector system [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to generate longer paired 250-bp Illumina sequence reads. Nick-translation reactions to extend Nb.BbvCI nicks were optimised to generate an Illumina sequencing template between 750 and 1,000 bp. PCR amplification of re-circularised products was optimised to reduce amplification to the minimum required for efficient sequencing of a large library. Overall, 576.5 M read pairs were generated from 55.1 M clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 2</xref>), generating 1.8x total sequence coverage of the wheat genome. When reads were mapped to chromosome 3B sequence assemblies, a consistent size distribution around 37.7 Kb was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1A</xref>), demonstrating correct phage lambda packaging and processing. Read depth varied several thousand-fold along chromosome 3B, likely due to matches of read-pairs to highly repetitive regions from across the genome. Consequently, only read-pairs with depth &#x02264;5 were used. Using this filter, we obtained sequence coverage of nearly 60% of the 833-Mb BAC-based chromosome 3B assembly. Simulations indicated that 0.75x sequence coverage of paired-end 250-bp reads was effective in creating long-range assemblies of wheat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional File 1</xref>); therefore we used Fosill read mapping for subsequent analyses.</p><p>Fosmid mate-pair sequences have been used to close gaps [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and detect structural variation [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in the human genome. Different types of variation, including insertions, deletions, and inversions spanning tens to hundreds of kb, were detected. Larger scale errors, for example, generated in the creation of pseudomolecules spanning chromosomes, are more readily detected using optical mapping and chromatin conformation methods [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Fosill reads were mapped to different assemblies of chromosome 3B and the long arm of chromosome 3D in order to compare the full range of current publicly available hexaploid and tetraploid wheat assemblies. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1A&#x02013;E</xref> shows the types of inconsistencies detected in different wheat assemblies using this approach. Looking first at the proportion of bases in different assemblies that were fully consistent with mapped 38-Kb mate-pair reads (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1A</xref>), the DenovoMAGIC Illumina-based WEW assembly, the larger TGACv1 assemblies, and the merged SMRT long-read and Illumina short read Triticum 3.0 assembly of chromosome 3B had, respectively, 99.6%, 98.9%,and 91.0% of bases in consistent Fosill windows. The manually curated BAC-based assembly of 3B had 85.7% of consistent bases, while the TGACv1 3B assembly had 80.5% of assembled sequence in consistent windows. The difference between the total TGACv1 3B assembly probably reflects the inclusion of shorter assemblies in the TGACv1 3B assembly that are shorter than 38 Kb. The non-curated BAC assembly of chromosome 3DL was the least accurate according to this measure, with only 57.2% of bases in consistent windows. These data demonstrate the superior accuracy of <italic>de novo</italic> whole genome sequencing strategies that incorporate deep and long 250-bp Illumina paired-end and mate-pair sequence coverage and the relative accuracy of long-range assemblies generated by mate-pair assembly strategies [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] compared to BAC-based and SMRT strategies [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The most frequent type of inconsistency identified by Fosill mapping was the potential incorrect joining of assemblies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1B</xref>). Illumina strategies using long mate-pair information produced the fewest incorrect joins, while BAC-based assemblies produced the most. Interestingly, the hybrid Triticum 3.0 assembly of both 3B and 3DL made from PacBio SMRT reads combined with 150-bp Illumina paired end reads [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] had more potential assembly errors than the Illumina-only assemblies, with 517 and 444 potential mis-assemblies on chromosomes 3B and 3DL, respectively. While the merged Triticum 3.0 assembly is more complete and contains no unknown bases, it was based on relatively short Illumina reads (150-bp paired end reads vs 250-bp paired end reads in the TGAC v1 and DenovoMAGIC assemblies) and did not include any longer Illumina mate-pair sequences. The multiple merging steps used in generating the Triticum 3.0 assembly may also contribute to the relatively high numbers of mis-assemblies. Assembly methods may also need further optimisation to utilize fully the potential of SMRT long reads. Furthermore, integrating long 250-bp Illumina reads into mega-reads may improve assemblies by distinguishing very closely related sequences, such as repeat regions from homoeologous chromosomes.</p><p>Potential deletion events were also quite common in all assemblies and were the most common inconsistencies detected in DenovoMAGIC assemblies of 3B. The sizes of these events are not known precisely, but they have a minimum size of 12 kb (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1E</xref>). These probably arise from missing tracts of near-identical sequence in assemblies. Similarly, potential insertions may arise from the incorrect integration of near-identical sequences into assemblies. The observation that potential deletions are more frequent than potential insertions suggests that all WGS-alone assembly strategies could achieve more complete assemblies of the wheat genome, such as that achieved using PacBio SMRT sequence assemblies. Finally, potential mis-orientations/inversions of assemblies are more common in the DevoMAGIC assembly of 3B than the other whole genome assemblies. Although this approach has yet to be fully described, mis-orientations may reflect more relaxed criteria for linking scaffolds than related Illumina-based assembly and scaffolding approaches [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>How much more accurate can the best current assemblies of bread wheat and WEW be, judging by their assemblies of chromosome 3B? Fosmid end-mapping to 2005 versions of human genome assemblies [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] identified 297 longer range discrepancies in the 3.2-Gb genome. Scaling from chromosome 3B (0.8 Gb) with 127 potential inconsistencies, our analyses predict 480 discrepancies per 3 Gb of WEW genome assembly, roughly twice the error frequency of 2005 versions of the human genome. It is likely that a DenovoMAGIC version of the hexaploid bread wheat genome will achieve similar high levels of accuracy and coverage.</p><p>Three-fold increases in the scaffold N50 sizes of the TGACv1 whole genome assembly were achieved by an additional scaffolding step using Fosill mate-pairs. In addition to making a more useful genomic resource, this additional scaffolding shows the relatively fragmentary but highly accurate TGACv1 assembly has the potential for substantial further improvement as an open-source and computationally efficient approach to assembling multiple wheat genomes [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, the direct integration of linked read technologies [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Nanopore long reads [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] into this assembly process should substantially increase contiguity, and directly and precisely identify a wide range of structural and phased sequence variation in wheat genome assemblies that are required for trait analyses and for accelerating breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Methods</title><p>Detailed descriptions of experimental and computational procedures are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup9">Additional Files</xref>.
