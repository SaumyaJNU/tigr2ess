Infection with <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> causes a significant reduction in crop yield and quality; therefore, it is very important to improve wheat pathogen resistance. In the present study, the plasmid pAHCht-2 harboring the <italic>rice chitinase</italic> (<italic>Cht-2</italic>) gene for pathogen resistance and the plasmid pAB6 containing the <italic>gus</italic> reporter and <italic>bar</italic> selectable marker genes were used for genetic transformation of immature embryo-derived calli of the Egyptian wheat cultivar Giza 164 using particle bombardment. Associated changes in defense mechanisms in the transgenic plants were investigated. The transgenic plants had significantly decreased total protein content, phenolic compounds and antioxidant enzyme activities (peroxidase and catalase), and significantly increased phenylalanine ammonia lyase and chitinase activities compared with non-transgenic plants under biotic stress conditions caused by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection. Our results show that activating a specific program of gene expression related to environmental stress conditions can reduce the cost of the stress on plant metabolism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications table</bold><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><alt-text id="at0010">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td><italic>E.g., Plant biology</italic></td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td><italic>Plant Biotechnology, Plant physiology</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td><italic>Table, text file, figure</italic></td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td><italic>Microscope, survey, SEM, NMR, mass spectrometry, etc.; if an instrument was used, please give the model and make.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td><italic>analyzed</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td><italic>Transformation of wheat plant with Ch-2 gene</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td>the plasmid pAHCht-2 harboring the <italic>rice chitinase</italic> (<italic>Cht-2</italic>) gene for pathogen resistance and the plasmid pAB6 containing the <italic>gus</italic> reporter and <italic>bar</italic> selectable marker genes were used for genetic transformation of immature embryo-derived calli of the Egyptian wheat cultivar Giza 164 using particle bombardment.
