id="Abs1"><p id="Par1">One of the biggest bottlenecks for structural analysis of proteins remains the creation of high-yield and high-purity samples of the target protein. Cell-free protein synthesis technologies are powerful and customizable platforms for obtaining functional proteins of interest in short timeframes, while avoiding potential toxicity issues and permitting high-throughput screening. These methods have benefited many areas of genomic and proteomics research, therapeutics, vaccine development and protein chip constructions. In this work, we demonstrate a versatile and multiscale eukaryotic wheat germ cell-free protein expression pipeline to generate functional proteins of different sizes from multiple host organism and DNA source origins. We also report on a robust purification procedure, which can produce highly pure (&#x0003e;&#x02009;98%) proteins with no specialized equipment required and minimal time invested. This pipeline successfully produced and analyzed proteins in all three major geometry formats used for structural biology including single particle analysis with electron microscopy, and both two-dimensional and three-dimensional protein crystallography. The flexibility of the wheat germ system in combination with the multiscale pipeline described here provides a new workflow for rapid production and purification of samples that may not be amenable to other recombinant approaches for structural characterization.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40679-018-0062-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cell-free protein expression</kwd><kwd>Wheat germ</kwd><kwd>Electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>X-ray</kwd><kwd>Structural biology</kwd><kwd>Protein purification</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>U.S. Department of Energy (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>66382</award-id><award-id>DE-FC02-02ER63421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>James E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM103403</award-id><award-id>S10OD021527</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par29">Systems biology seeks to understand genomic and proteomic changes between species or between individual cells to link compositional changes in the genome (or proteome) to the observed phenotype. However, many organisms still have an array of genes and proteins of unknown structure and function while other annotated proteins may have limited homology to proteins in the same class. For example, more than 2000 of the 8000 genes identified in the smallest eukaryote <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> are designated as proteins of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Understanding the structure, mechanism and function of these unknown proteins is the key to connecting information across scales from the individual protein to whole cell/organism. Thus, a better link is needed to connect proteomic output with structural biology pipelines.</p><p id="Par30">Today, a variety of cell-free expression options have emerged as powerful alternatives to laborious in vivo methods of protein synthesis to support the growing demand for easy and cost-effective ways for protein production. Depending on the biochemical properties, the origin and the potential use of the proteins to be expressed, several cell-free protein expression systems can be explored and are commercially available today. These are based on <italic>E. coli</italic>, wheat germ, rabbit reticulocyte, <italic>L. tarentolae</italic>, insect and human cell extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although not currently commercially available, efficient cell-free lysates can also be prepared from tobacco BY-2 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All cell-free translation systems rely on two major components: (1) a specifically designed vector or a PCR template with your gene of interest, and (2) a cell extract of choice that matches the experimental needs for yield or post-translational modifications. The reagents are supplemented with additional energy sources, amino acids and various cofactor molecules to aid continuous protein synthesis and folding. Key advantages of these systems are the ease of the setup, fast turnaround times, linear scalability for the reaction volumes and amenability to high-throughput screening. Additionally, these platforms allow significant customization as one can directly provide additives to aid solubilization and folding of difficult targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. One can also include unnatural amino acids to facilitate labeling and characterization or introduce additional DNA/RNA templates to generate diverse protein hetero-assemblies by co-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Since there is no need to sustain a living organism, toxic proteins that failed to be produced by cell-based methods can be readily expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These numerous benefits are being widely exploited in applications of NMR and X-ray structure determination, functional genomics and proteome research, protein chip construction, therapeutics and vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">While thousands of proteins can be manufactured in a high-throughput fashion using the cell-free translation format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], structural biology primarily requires a supply of specific protein components. Thus, the most critical parameters are high yield and high purity of the protein sample. High-resolution structural studies require at least 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of highly purified protein for cryo-EM; whereas, X-ray crystallography can require 1&#x000a0;mg or more. As of today, in comparison with other cell-free systems, <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free protein production is the most frequently used for the needs of structural biology in X-ray and NMR due to its cost and availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, a wheat germ lysate has the highest solubility and the highest translation yields for eukaryotic proteins. For instance, in the high-throughput proteome study, 12,996 human clones (out of 13,364 tested) gave rise to proteins; whereas, 97.6% of those were detectable in a soluble fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, codon optimization is not required for wheat germ, which makes it compatible with various DNA templates from different organisms of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Despite these benefits, the use of wheat germ cell-free system for structural biology has been primarily limited to NMR studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There is only one report on the use of this system for X-ray structure determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], yet that study utilized methods for the purification of PabI protein based on its heat-resistance properties, which are&#x000a0;not broadly applicable for other protein targets.</p><p id="Par32">The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory is a United States Department of Energy user facility that is primarily focused on organisms relevant to bioenergy and the environment such as bacteria, algae, fungi and plants. Using a wheat germ cell-free expression system from CellFree Sciences, invented by the Endo group from Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we sought to build a cell-free expression pipeline to link the systems biology and structural biology capabilities at this user facility, while maintaining applicability to a wide range of organisms and being compatible with all sample geometries used for high-resolution electron microscopy and X-ray structural analysis. Here, we describe a multiscale pipeline that allows quick screening for protein solubility, quick optimization of expression yield along with purification strategies suitable for high-resolution structural investigations using several target genes from various diverse organisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussions</title><p id="Par33">Our multiscale protein production workflow included four different scales of protein expression (MINI, MIDI, MAXI and MEGA) to allow screening for solubility and impact of additives (MINI), overall expression levels and purification optimization (MIDI), and scale-up for cryo-EM (MAXI) or X-ray crystallography applications (MEGA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Experimental workflow for the cell-free expression platform used in this study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40679_2018_62_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quick translation trials to determine the protein expression potential (MINI)</title><p id="Par34">PCR templates for cell-free expression can be prepared in short amount of time (compared to construction of vectors) and can, therefore, be used to quickly test target protein for expression and solubility. Our first stage involves MINI-translation reactions using PCR templates and fluorescently labeled lysine-charged&#x000a0;tRNA. These reactions are only 55&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l in volume allowing for small-scale testing of various conditions with minimal expenditure of reagents. The PCR template requires just three elements: a SP6 transcriptional promoter, an E01 translational enhancer sequence and a 3&#x02032;-UTR for better protection of mRNA against degradation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To incorporate those elements, a two-step PCR using a split primer design is suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the first round of PCR (PCR1), the gene of interest is amplified using a pair of gene-specific primers, where a reverse primer is designed to bind at ~&#x02009;1.4&#x02013;1.6&#x000a0;kB away from the termination codon. At the second round of PCR (PCR2), the SP6 promoter and the E01 sequence are introduced through two forward primers SPU and deSP6E01, described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The final PCR construct serves as the template for transcription and MINI-scale translation. To create a universal approach in handling DNA from different sources, we carried out all PCR reactions using the Q5 DNA polymerase from NEB, a high-fidelity enzyme with ultra-low error rates and suitable for low, medium and high GC contents of DNA template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, the Q5 enzyme demonstrates better capacity to produce long amplicons.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Expression trials using PCR templates. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of two-step PCR template preparation for CellFree Sciences wheat germ expression kit followed by transcription and translation in the presence of the FluoroTect Green<sub>Lys</sub> tRNA.

The PCR template for CCMK was successfully amplified from a commercially purchased cDNA clone, while the GBSSI gene was specifically amplified directly from the genome of <italic>O. tauri</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, see PCR1). The subsequent PCR2 reactions yielded the desired amplicons and were good templates for high-yield production of full-length mRNAs&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), which were further introduced into MINI-translation mix (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). For quick detection of the protein product, all MINI-translation reactions were supplemented with the fluorophore-labeled lysine-charged tRNA (FluoroTect&#x02122; Green<sub>Lys</sub>) for incorporation of fluorophore-tagged lysine into the synthesized protein. The use of the fluorophore-tagged lysine allows detection of picomolar levels of protein with SDS-PAGE without any need for purification. Both CCMK and GBSSI proteins were expressed efficiently using this cell-free format and displayed high solubility. Although not seen in the current experiment, it is important to note that this quick screening procedure can also be useful in detection of premature termination, which may indicate needs for additional supplementation or codon optimization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>pEU vectors, protein synthesis and purification (MIDI)</title><p id="Par36">If PCR screening trials were successful, the gene of interest was further cloned into our modified pEU vector. For high-yield applications, the optimal expression template is the pEU vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which was modified in house to include a 3XFLAG tag (resulting in vectors pEU-3XFLAG-gene, pEU_3XFLAG_gene_10His&#x000a0;and pEU_gene_3XFLAG). Every newly produced plasmid was also tested at a MINI scale to assess the quality of produced mRNA and protein. The quality of the plasmid itself was found to be critical for obtaining high yields of mRNA, and thus high yields of protein sequentially. An example of low-quality mRNA is demonstrated in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A, lane 4. To avoid the latter, the plasmid should be free of RNases, which can originate from plasmid preparation kit itself. However, we usually find that the main cause of bad-quality RNA is the plasmid mechanical shearing such as nicking during general plasmid purification procedures. This nicking is not critical for many other applications, but, for in vitro transcription reactions, premature runs-off are observed. Therefore, during plasmid productions, gentle cell resuspension and minimal vortexing of DNA are warranted.</p><p id="Par37">The main advantage of cell-free synthesis is the linear scalability of the reaction volumes where reactions can be run as MINI-expression trials to determine gene suitability or scaled up for high-resolution structural studies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). If the plasmid passed the MINI-scale stage, we moved to a MIDI-scale production. The goal here is to determine if the tag attached to either the 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; end of the protein is fully available for efficient binding. As mentioned above, CCMK and GBBSI were found to be good candidates for the cell-free production using PCR screening. Therefore, both genes were cloned into pEU plasmids and tested for protein synthesis and purification using two different tags: 6&#x000d7;His and 3XFLAG. Initially, the CCMK protein was fused with 6&#x000d7;His tag and purified using HIS-SELECT magnetic beads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Naturally, the wheat germ extract has many endogenous proteins which will nonspecifically bind to nickel; therefore, the wheat germ extract optimized for His-tag purification was also employed. A single band of CCMK of desirable purity is clearly seen in the final fraction, which was later used for 2D crystallization trial (discussed later).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Protein synthesis and purification. <bold>a</bold> SDS-PAGE gel, showing the expression and purification of CCMK protein using 6&#x000d7;His-tag.

</p><p id="Par38">Despite the use of His-tag-optimized wheat germ extract, the desired purity of CCMK was achieved at the expense of the product yield where 50&#x000a0;mM imidazole washes were employed to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The same purification procedure with 10&#x000a0;mM imidazole washes generated much more material. However, a significant fraction of endogenous proteins was recovered as well unsuitable for our applications (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B, lane 7). Ideally, one can try a range of imidazole concentrations to find the optimal value. However, to avoid optimization trials in this regard, we decided to employ a 3XFLAG-based purification scheme. The GBSSI protein was first fused with 3XFLAG sequence on its N-terminus and was tested in the purification trial using ANTI-M2 monoclonal magnetic beads. Expressed GBSSI showed good binding to the beads, as indicated by the full disappearance of the expressed protein band in the flow-through fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, compare lanes 3 and 4). Beads were washed, and then two competitive elution reactions with 3XFLAG peptide were followed to release the protein from the matrix. Both elution fractions had high amounts of released protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, lanes 5 and 6). Purified protein appeared to be full size, homogenous and free of other contaminating proteins coming from the extract itself (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, lane 7). Using enterokinase, the 3XFLAG tag was then removed with &#x0003e;&#x02009;93% efficiency (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, lane 8). The same purification procedure has been tested on several other proteins including glutamine synthetase (GS, 75&#x000a0;kDa) and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK, 100&#x000a0;kDa) proteins from <italic>O. tauri</italic>, sieve element occlusion protein from <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (SEO1, 75&#x000a0;kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate synthase-like subunit (PDX1.2, 34&#x000a0;kDa) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. All SDS-PAGE gels for these proteins are included (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A). High purity of each final sample was achieved along with high protein recovery. Only PDX1.2 has a somewhat reduced binding to the beads due to its tight structural fold (demonstrated in the next section). It is worth noting that the major advantage of using the 3XFLAG tag is that we observed a complete lack of nonspecific binding. As the result, no optimization is required, and a general one-step purification &#x0201c;bind&#x02013;wash&#x02013;elute&#x0201d; protocol can be used for all samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Diverse structural biology applications of cell-free produced proteins</title><p id="Par39">Once we had an isolated protein in hand, the next step was to verify its activity, assembly state and identify whether it is a suitable candidate for high-resolution structural studies.

These protein amounts are sufficient for various functional assays, Native PAGE electrophoresis, and preliminary TEM imaging characterization.

Similarly, 2D crystallization for a CCMK homolog from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC6803 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] using a nickelated lipid monolayer also resulted in hexameric assemblies. To validate our pipeline, cell-free expressed and purified CCMK (6&#x000d7;His tagged) in this study was subjected to a similar 2D crystallization trial. From the first attempt, initial 2D crystal patches were formed and analyzed by TEM imaging (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Negatively stained CCMK proteins were clearly visualized as hexameric structures, mimicking the packing in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Image processing of the collected EM micrographs revealed a lattice with reflections extending to 13&#x000a0;&#x000c5;, limited by the negative stain itself. This 2D crystal lattice was able to be directly overlaid by the known atomic structure of <italic>P. marinus</italic> CCMK (RCSB: 4OX8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] verifying that the expected structural fold has been adopted by the cell-free-synthesized CCMK protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>The applications of cell-free produced proteins in conventional electron microscopy. <bold>a</bold> STEM image of negatively stained 2D crystals of CCMK protein (inverted contrast). <bold>b</bold> The image from (<bold>a</bold>) has been processed using a temperature factor of &#x02212;&#x02009;100, and an IQ cutoff of 2 for the final map.

GS and PDX1.2 proteins were found to form defined higher-molecular weight complexes; whereas, the other proteins showed multiple assembly states. TEM images collected for PDX1.2 showed a two-ring stacked architecture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, d). No aggregation events or partially disordered complexes were seen, which suggests that the population is quite homogenous where the average diameter of formed complexes was 12&#x000a0;nm. The protein structure closely resembles the structural arrangements of similar PDX1.1 and 1.3 proteins, which also form two-ring dodecamers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As a result, PDX1.2 protein seems to form proper structural arrangements and would be a good candidate system for single particle analysis studies by cryo-EM after scale-up expression.</p><p id="Par41">We also explored expression of SEO proteins from <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, which are known to form large protein bodies, called forisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These spindle-shaped bodies achieve tens of micrometers in length and look like elongated needles, which swell and deform upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> introduction. This swelling/deformation is reversible, and it is a critical mechanism in sieve tube flow control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Natural forisomes consist of several members of SEO protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, SEO proteins have not been analyzed at the individual protein level previously. As seen in Native PAGE, cell-free produced SEO1 (with the&#x000a0;monomer molecular weight of 75&#x000a0;kDa) runs higher than the 480&#x000a0;kDa NativeMark molecular weight standard and upon 3XFLAG removal, SEO1 proteins form even higher-order molecular weight structures (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B). TEM images of SEO1 proteins show that, at the initial stages of assembly, they form individual fibrils, which serve as building blocks for higher-order congregation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>e&#x02013;h). Additional incubation of SEO1 (in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free environment, 10&#x000a0;mM EGTA) results in the formation of micrometer-long strands, composed of multiple individual fibrils aligned and interacting cooperatively. The obtained data are consistent with the functional roles of these proteins in vivo, where they participate in the molecular self-assembly of large 3D bodies. This is the first demonstration that such protein bodies can be generated in vitro from individual monomers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Scaling-up for cryo-EM (MAXI) and X-ray (MEGA) structural approaches</title><p id="Par42">Due to significant instrumental advances in the electron microscopy such as the development of direct electron cameras and phase plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) holds a promise to be major imaging technology to study the structures of biological molecules in its native environment.

Since the negative stain imaging of PDX1.2 showed a fairly homogenous sample, a MAXI-scale cell-free expression was performed to generate suitable protein for cryo-EM. While the current 2D class averages and initial 3D volume are limited in resolution due to the conventional microscope used and available for this work (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), preliminary 3D single-particle reconstruction of PDX1.2 complex clearly shows that PDX1.2 adopts a 2-ring stacked dodecameric architecture of sixfold symmetry with the diameter of 11.4&#x000a0;nm and height of 7.5&#x000a0;nm.

As of 2018, wheat germ cell-free expression (WGCF) kits are available from two manufacturers: CellFree Sciences and Promega. To minimize sample handling, the Promega WGCF kit offers a coupled setup where transcription and translation are run simultaneously. The CellFree Sciences WGCF kits have transcription and translation processes rather decoupled where each step is optimized individually to maximize the yield. If one needs to use an additive for the translation or change the reaction temperature, the latter setup offers a benefit of not interfering with the transcription stage. Due to the above-described reasons and a wider selection of the reagents for a MINI/MIDI or MAXI/MEGA-protein synthesis, we opted to use the commercial system from CellFree Sciences.</p><p id="Par46">While the use of the specialized pEU vector is preferred to obtain higher yields of the given protein in this cell-free format, the most time-consuming steps are still the cloning of the respective gene, purification of the plasmid product, its subsequent sequencing and scale-up preparation. While this is the final route to get high quantities of the desired protein product, it is always beneficial to know in advance if the protein is a good candidate to be expressed in this system and is worth the time invested. Fortunately, cell-free expression with somewhat reduced protein yields can be performed using PCR templates. The latter offers an ideal rapid screening to explore the protein potential to be expressed in a soluble and active form. Based on our experiences in expressing a variety of proteins for different applications, we had a very high probability of producing good quality proteins from different organisms using this system.</p><p id="Par47">In combination with the wheat germ cell-free extract, this work presents a useful methodology for a multiscale pipeline covering all stages from cloning, screening potential candidates of protein synthesis to final production of micrograms quantities of a highly pure and tag-free protein. We show that the developed 3XFLAG purification protocol allowed high protein recoveries with purities reaching 98%, and it was found to be our preferred method for preparation of all protein samples. The only exception was to use a His-tag-based purification for the 2D protein crystallography method which relies on a Ni-NTA functionalized lipid monolayer. Nevertheless, His-tag purification can be considered a good alternative strategy. In terms of yield, 0.6&#x000a0;mg/ml wheat germ extract has been generally obtained in the bilayer format used here. Not demonstrated here, but for large-scale productions, impressive protein yields up to 20&#x000a0;mg per ml of wheat germ&#x000a0;extract can be achieved by a two-chamber dialysis or a &#x0201c;filter-feed&#x0201d; method using dedicated robotic synthesizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While we show that such robotic platforms are not necessary, if available at a nearby institution, they could be used to replace the MEGA-scale expression using lower reaction volumes at potentially lower cost. In terms of structural function/fold, cell-free-produced proteins in this study exhibited expected structure and assembly state in comparison with similar proteins produced and characterized by other means.</p><p id="Par48">The generated protein products are compatible with three major protein sample formats for high-resolution structural studies: (1) single-particle analysis, (2) 2D crystallography and (3) 3D macromolecular crystallography. Obviously, the developed pipeline is applicable to any science area where interests lie in expressing of proteins in high yields and purities without the use of any specialized equipment and minimal time invested. Due to the fact that the cell-free expression platforms are gaining significant popularity, we believe that these comprehensive experiments will be useful for a wide range of scientific audience interested in exploring these systems especially as this platform can be replicated without major investments in instrumentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>DNA template construction</title><p id="Par49">PCR reactions were carried out using the Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2&#x000d7; Master Mix from New England Biolabs.

Molecular ladders used were Broad Range Protein Molecular Weight Markers from Promega and Kaleidoscope&#x02122; Prestained Standards (#161-0324 and #161-0375) from Bio-Rad. Native PAGE was performed using the same 10% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein gels where 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of protein solution was mixed with 12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 2&#x000d7; Native Sample Buffer from Bio-Rad prior to loading (no heat denaturation employed). For Native PAGE, the molecular ladder used was NativeMark&#x02122; Unstained Protein Standard from Thermo Fisher (#LC0725).</p><p id="Par57">To analyze the proteins comprising FluoroTect Green<sub>Lys</sub>, the denaturation protocol for SDS-PAGE was changed to 70&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;min, and a protein loading per well was increased to 6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l. After the run was complete, the fluorescent images of gels were collected immediately by FluorChem Q from Alpha Innotech or a laser-based scanner Typhoon FLA 9500 from GE Healthcare, set for Alexa488 excitation and emission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>2D protein crystallization using a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelating lipid monolayer</title><p id="Par58">Purified CCMK protein with 6xHis tag on C-terminal (15&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l, 0.3&#x000a0;mg/ml) was adjusted with imidazole to 10&#x000a0;mM and glycerol to 10% and loaded in the concave well of PELCO Immunostaining Pad from Ted Pella. Lipid mixture was prepared by combining four parts of 10&#x000a0;mg/ml of DOPC (in chloroform) with one part of 2.5&#x000a0;mg/ml of 18:1 DGS-NTA(Ni) (in chloroform), achieving the final weight ratio of 16:1. Both lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. To create a monolayer, 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of lipid mixture was deposited on the air&#x02013;water interface of the protein solution. The PELCO pad was then enclosed inside the sealed Petri dish, containing wet filter papers to create a humid environment and prevent evaporation. The 2D crystallization was carried out at room temperature for 13&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>TEM imaging and data analysis</title><p id="Par59">Negative staining of PDX1.2 and SEO1 proteins was carried out in the following manner: (1) an ultrathin carbon film on lacey carbon (01824, Ted Pella) was glow discharged at 10&#x000a0;mA for 30&#x000a0;s using PELCO easiGlow from Ted Pella, (2) 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of protein solution was deposited on the carbon side and let to absorb for 1&#x000a0;min, (3) the excess of solution was blotted away, and the grid was floated on a 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l drop of the NanoW stain from Nanoprobes for 1&#x000a0;min, (4) then the excess of the stain was wicked away, and the grid was let to air-dry. For 2D protein crystals (CCMK protein), an ultrathin carbon film on lacey carbon grid was not glow discharged. The carbon side was directly dropped down on top of lipid layer at the air&#x02013;water interface of protein solution. The grid was then lifted and transferred to a drop of Nano-W stain, incubated for 1&#x000a0;min, blotted and air-dried. The EM micrographs were acquired on 300&#x000a0;kV FEI Environmental TEM, 300&#x000a0;kV FEI Scanning TEM and 300&#x000a0;kV JEOL JEM-3000SFF. For CCMK crystals, the Focus suite has been used for image processing, FFT determination, lattice unbending, and mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For cryo-EM experiments, C-flat holey grids (CF213, EMS) were used instead. Prior to sample deposition, they were first glow discharged at the same conditions as above and then transferred to the plunge-freezer Leica EM GP, brought to 80% humidity at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Then, 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of PDX1.2 protein sample (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, in TBS buffer) was pipetted on the carbon side and blotted for 3&#x000a0;s before plunge-freezing in the liquid ethane. The frozen samples were then transferred to liquid nitrogen and then to 300&#x000a0;kV JEOL JEM-3000SFF, pre-cooled with liquid helium to 4&#x000a0;K. The data were collected at low-dose conditions with defocus values of 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m using DE20 camera from Direct Electron in movie mode. Each movie consisted of 16 frames encompassing total exposure of 0.5&#x000a0;s with electron flux per frame of 2 electrons per square angstrom and a pixel size of 0.117&#x000a0;nm. All standard image processing from movie alignment to 3D map refinement was performed using CisTEM software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] with default parameters (apart from inputting the microscope Cs, image pixel size and estimated particle radii and symmetry).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>X-ray crystallization trials</title><p id="Par60">Cell-free-produced GS protein (tagged with 3XFLAG, 10&#x000a0;mg/ml, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) was crystallized in hanging drop format by the addition of 0.2&#x000a0;M sodium chloride, 0.1&#x000a0;M BIS-Tris pH 5.5 and 25% w/v PEG 3350.
