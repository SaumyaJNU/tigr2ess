In order to increase its grain yield, it is critical to understand the eco-physiological differences in grain filling between the waxy and non-waxy wheat. In this study, two waxy wheat and two non-waxy wheat cultivars were used to investigate the differences in starch-associated enzymes processes, sucrose and starch dynamics, yield components, and the final grain yield. The results indicated that the mean total grain starch and amylose content, the average 1000-kernel weight and grain yield of the waxy wheat were lower than those of the non-waxy wheat at maturity. The amylose content was significantly and positively correlated with the activity of GBSS (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Significant positive correlation also exists among activities of AGPase, SSS, GBSS, and SBE, except for GBSS-SBE. In summary, our study has revealed that the reduced conversion of sucrose to starch in the late grain filling stage is the main cause for the low kernel weight and total starch accumulation of the waxy wheat. The reduced conversion also appears to be a factor contributing to the lower grain yield of the waxy wheat.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the growing in health-conscious consumers, there has been an increase in demand for high-quality wheat flour. The endosperm starch content and composition are two critical parameters for evaluating the quality of wheat flour. For conventionally cultivated wheat, namely non-waxy wheat, starch is a mixture of about 75% amylopectin and 25% amylose. To further improve the quality of wheat flour products such as reducing staling in flour products, keeping baking goods fresh for a longer period of time, and improving the palatability of noodles, the replacement of regular wheat flour with waxy wheat flour may provide a promising solution, as waxy wheat grains contain almost 100% amylopectin in their starch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Common wheat cultivars have three homeologous waxy genes, <italic>Wx-A1</italic>, <italic>Wx-B1</italic> and <italic>Wx-D1</italic>, and waxy wheat mutants lack all three Wx proteins. The Wx proteins are also known as granule-bound starch synthases, which have a role in the synthesis of amylose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, due to low grain yield, the waxy wheat has not been widely cultivated in recent years. To improve the current situation, there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the differences in yield performance between the waxy and non-waxy wheat cultivars at the field level.</p><p id="Par3">The endosperm starch content (approximate 70% of the dry weight) not only influences the grain weight and quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but also reflects the capacity of the sink tissues. Regarding the source-sink relationship, the photoassimilates produced in source tissues as leaf, stem and root were transported into the amyloplast in the form of sucrose, which is the main carbohydrate transported in higher plants. Sucrose is degraded to fructose and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) which are the main precursors of starch synthesis by sucrose synthase (SUS: EC 2.4.1.13)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The ability of the sink tissues to accept and convert photoassimilates can be affected by the sink strength, which is an important limiting factor to wheat grain yield, and the activity of SUS can be considered as an indicator of sink strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A coordinated series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in wheat endosperm result in starch synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, including ADPG pyrophosphorylase (AGPase: EC 2.7.7.27), starch branching enzyme (SBE: EC 2.4.1.18), starch debranching enzyme (DBE), granule bound starch synthase (GBSS: EC 2.4.1.21) and soluble starch synthase(SSS: EC 2.4.1.21). GBSS and SSS are the two forms of starch synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For catalyzing the first unique step in starch synthesis, AGPase is the rate-limiting enzyme and is the most important determinant of seed sink strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Starch synthases catalyse the elongation of the linear glucan chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, moreover the different genetic characterization assigns preferential functions for individual isoforms to synthesize amylose or amylopectin. It is generally known that in the endosperm, amylose is synthesized by AGPase and GBSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. SBE that was formerly known as Q-enzyme plays an important role on amylopectin synthesis, which is the only plant enzyme that can introduce &#x003b1;-1,6-glucosidic linkages into &#x003b1;-polyglucans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Previous researches on waxy wheat have focused on the end-use quality, composition of the grain and the expression of the <italic>Wx</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Improving the agronomic performance is critical in order to meet human demands on high-quality wheat products. In practice, grain yield is determined not only by factors such as the number of spikes, number of kernels per spike and 1000-kernel weight but also by the source-sink relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

At 30d after anthesis, the AGPase activity started to decrease, resulting in a reduction in the rate of starch, amylose and amylopectin accumulation. During the later grain filling period, the starch accumulation and accumulation rate of waxy wheat were lower than that of non-waxy wheat. Similar findings have also been reported in previous studies: in other crops higher AGPase activity resulted in higher crop starch biosynthesis and grain yield including maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">GBSS is exclusively involved in the synthesis of amylose, where it catalyzes the extension of long glucans within the amylopectin fraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

During the early grain filling period, no significant difference was found in sink size between the waxy and non-waxy wheat, while higher sucrose degradation and bioavailability and activities of SSS and SBE in grains of waxy wheat were found. Low activities of SSS and SBE in waxy wheat are likely the cause of low amylopectin accumulation in the later stage of grain filling. We speculate that the four enzymes, AGPase, SSS, GBSS and SBE, may have a complementary relationship with regards to starch biosynthesis; thus, the absence of GBSS can reduce the activity of the other three enzymes, leading to low total starch content in grains of waxy wheat. The low activity of SUS during later period of grain filling may have caused the reduced degradation of sucrose and the absence of the precursor of starch in grains of waxy wheat. It appears that weakened starch synthesis in the later stage of grain filling of waxy wheat is likely to be the main cause of low kernel weight and total starch accumulation, which ultimately leads to lower grain yield in waxy wheat.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Yan Zi and Jinfeng Ding contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p>A correction to this article is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25219-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-25219-9</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>5/1/2018</p><p>A correction to this article has been published and is linked from the HTML version of this paper.
