<italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is a gut symbiont inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of numerous vertebrates. The surface-exposed serine-rich repeat protein (SRRP) is a major adhesin in Gram-positive bacteria. Using lectin and sugar nucleotide profiling of wild-type or <italic>L. reuteri</italic> isogenic mutants, MALDI-ToF-MS, LC&#x02013;MS and GC&#x02013;MS analyses of SRRPs, we showed that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains 100-23C (from rodent) and ATCC 53608 (from pig) can perform protein <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation and modify SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> and SRRP<sub>53608</sub> with Hex-Glc-GlcNAc and di-GlcNAc moieties, respectively. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> glycoengineering in <italic>E. coli</italic> led to glycosylation of SRRP<sub>53608</sub> variants with &#x003b1;-GlcNAc and GlcNAc&#x003b2;(1&#x02192;6)GlcNAc&#x003b1; moieties. The glycosyltransferases involved in the modification of these adhesins were identified within the SecA2/Y2 accessory secretion system and their sugar nucleotide preference determined by saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning fluorimetry. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the cellular <italic>O</italic>-protein glycosylation pathways of gut commensal bacteria and potential routes for glycoengineering applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>accessory secretion system</kwd><kwd>glycosyltransferase</kwd><kwd>gut commensal bacteria</kwd><kwd><italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation</kwd><kwd>sugar nucleotides</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100000268</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Institute Strategic Programmes</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Gut Health and Food Safety</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004529/1</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Gut Microbes and Health</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BB/R012490/1</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Understanding and Exploiting Metabolism</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BB/j004561/1</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">BBSRC</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BB/P010660/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="cwy100s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although originally believed to be restricted to eukaryotes, protein glycosylation, i.e., the covalent attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to specific protein targets, is emerging as an important feature in bacteria and archaea, revealing an important diversity of glycan structures and pathways within and between microbial species (<xref rid="cwy100C32" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000e4;ffer and Messner 2017</xref>). To date, protein glycosylation has been widely studied in pathogenic bacteria, where glycoproteins are often essential for virulence and pathogenicity (<xref rid="cwy100C12" ref-type="bibr">Eichler and Koomey 2017</xref>). However, the nature and function of protein glycosylation in gut commensal bacteria remains largely unexplored (<xref rid="cwy100C19" ref-type="bibr">Latousakis and Juge 2018</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> is a Gram-positive bacterial symbiont inhabiting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a range of vertebrates (including humans) that displays a remarkable degree of host specialization (<xref rid="cwy100C25" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C15" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C44" ref-type="bibr">Wegmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C10" ref-type="bibr">Duar et al. 2017</xref>). One of the mechanisms mediating specific interaction of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains with the host is provided by cell surface proteins that facilitate adherence to epithelial or mucosal surface along the GI tract, depending on the niche colonized by the bacteria (<xref rid="cwy100C23" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C13" ref-type="bibr">Etzold et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). Previous analyses of the rodent strain <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C identified a gene encoding a predicted surface-exposed serine-rich repeat protein (SRRP<sub>100-23</sub>) that was essential for <italic>L. reuteri</italic> biofilm formation in the forestomach of mice (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>). Inactivation of SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> completely abrogated epithelial association, indicating that initial adhesion represented the most significant step in biofilm formation, likely conferring host specificity (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>SRRPs are a family of adhesins found in many Gram-positive bacteria (<xref rid="cwy100C22" ref-type="bibr">Lizcano et al. 2012</xref>). These proteins were originally identified in pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococci and staphylococci (<xref rid="cwy100C45" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C5" ref-type="bibr">Bensing and Sullam 2002</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C49" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Wu 2009</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C35" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2014</xref>), where their expression has been linked to virulence (<xref rid="cwy100C38" ref-type="bibr">Shivshankar et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C31" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al. 2010</xref>). SRRPs are composed of distinct subdomains: a cleavable and unusually long signal peptide which, in some cases, is followed by an alanine-serine-threonine rich (AST) motif, a short serine rich repeat region (SRR1), a binding region (BR), a second and much larger SRR2, and an LPXTG cell wall anchoring motif (<xref rid="cwy100C30" ref-type="bibr">Rigel and Braunstein 2008</xref>). Previous studies on SRRPs from pathogenic organisms have shown that these proteins are <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated on serine or threonine residues and exported via an accessory secretion (SecA2/Y2) system (<xref rid="cwy100C5" ref-type="bibr">Bensing and Sullam 2002</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C3" ref-type="bibr">Bensing et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C40" ref-type="bibr">Takamatsu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C39" ref-type="bibr">Siboo et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C6" ref-type="bibr">Chaze et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2014</xref>). This specialized secretion system is encoded by genes that are normally co-located within a gene cluster and is composed of the motor protein SecA2, the translocon channel SecY2 and three to five accessory Sec proteins (Asp1-5). In addition, this gene cluster also contains genes encoding a variable number of glycosyltransferases (GTs), ranging between two and ten (<xref rid="cwy100C4" ref-type="bibr">Bensing et al. 2014</xref>). The best studied examples of SecA2/SecY2-mediated glycosylation systems are from pathogenic <italic>Streptococcus parasanguinis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus gordonii</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C40" ref-type="bibr">Takamatsu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>). In all cases, the glycosylation process is initiated by a two-protein glycosyltransferase complex, consisting of GtfA and GtfB, that mediate the addition of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues within the SRR domains of the adhesins. This is sometimes followed by the extension of the core glycan via the action of additional GTs whose number and type vary between species, resulting in a range of glycan structures (<xref rid="cwy100C51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2018</xref>). Recently, a SecA2/Y2 cluster encoding three SRRPs has been identified in the commensal species <italic>Streptococcus salivarius</italic> JIM8777; unusually the first glycosylation step was carried out by two genetically linked GTs outside of the cluster (<xref rid="cwy100C9" ref-type="bibr">Couvigny et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>To date, SecA2/Y2 clusters have been identified in the genomes of various <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species (<xref rid="cwy100C42" ref-type="bibr">Tytgat and de Vos 2016</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C19" ref-type="bibr">Latousakis and Juge 2018</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). In <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, the intact cluster has mostly been found in strains of murine or porcine origin, and it appears to be absent from strains of human origin (<xref rid="cwy100C15" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C44" ref-type="bibr">Wegmann et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). The SecA2/Y2 cluster in the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> rodent strain 100-23C is crucial for ecological fitness and adhesion of the bacteria to the forestomach epithelium of the murine GI tract (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>). Using proteomics, we showed that SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> is the primary cell wall-associated protein of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C strain that is secreted through the accessory SecA2/Y2 system (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>). In addition, our analysis of the completed genome of the pig isolate <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608 revealed the presence of a SecA2/Y2 system with an associated SRRP sharing the same domain organization as SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> (<xref rid="cwy100C44" ref-type="bibr">Wegmann et al. 2015</xref>). Further analysis of the pangenome of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> pig isolates also revealed the presence of a SecA2/Y2 system with an associated SRRP in these strains (<xref rid="cwy100C44" ref-type="bibr">Wegmann et al. 2015</xref>), suggesting a conserved role of SecA2/Y2 among <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains that possess the cluster. We confirmed that the SRRPs from <italic>L. reuteri</italic> pig strains were secreted during growth <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>), as previously shown for SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>). However, despite the central importance of the SecA2/Y2 cluster and SRRPs in specific <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains, how SRRPs are glycosylated in lactobacilli has not yet been determined.</p><p>Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the glycosylation of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> SRRPs (<italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs) from <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608 (pig) and 100-23C (rodent) strains. Using a combination of bioinformatics analysis, lectin screening, LC&#x02013;MS-based sugar nucleotide profiling, MALDI-ToF and GC&#x02013;MS analyses, we showed that the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608 and 100-23C strains are capable of performing protein glycosylation and that SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> and SRRP<sub>53608</sub> are glycosylated with hexose (Hex)<sub>2</sub>-<italic>N</italic>-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) and di-HexNAc moieties, respectively. Following <italic>in vivo</italic> glycoengineering in <italic>E. coli</italic>, NMR analysis and enzymatic treatment showed that SRRP<sub>53608</sub> is glycosylated with GlcNAc&#x003b2;(1&#x02192;6)GlcNAc&#x003b1; moieties. In addition, using Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) and Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR, we provide biochemical insights into the specificity of the glycosyltransferases involved in the SecA2/Y2 accessory pathway leading to the protein glycosylation of these adhesins in gut symbionts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="cwy100s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="cwy100s3"><title>SRRPs from <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains 100-23C and ATCC 53608 are glycosylated</title><p>To determine whether <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains 100-23C and ATCC 53608 are capable of performing protein glycosylation of <italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs, the proteins from the spent media (SM) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot using a range of fluorescein (<italic>f</italic>)-labeled lectins. A similar lectin recognition profile was observed between proteins from both <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains with binding to <italic>f-</italic>WGA, <italic>f-</italic>RCA and <italic>f-</italic>SNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F1">1</xref>A) while no binding was observed with <italic>f-</italic>ConA, <italic>f-</italic>LTL, <italic>f-</italic>PNA or <italic>f-</italic>UEA (data not shown). This suggests the presence of glycoproteins carrying GlcNAc, sialic acid or galactose (Gal) residues. A large protein with an apparent molecular weight (MW) &#x0003e; 300 kDa was detected in both <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains by <italic>f-</italic>WGA but not with any of the other lectins tested. This protein was also recognized by anti-SRRP-BR<sub>53608</sub> antibodies in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608 SM, suggesting that it corresponds to SRRP<sub>53608</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F1">1</xref>B). It is of note that Coomassie-staining cannot efficiently detect <italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs, probably due to their unusual amino acid composition and glycosylation. The anti-SRRP-BR<sub>53608</sub> does not cross-react with SRRP<sub>100-</sub><sub>23</sub> which may be due to the low amino acid similarity (48%) between the two binding regions of the two adhesins (<xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). Previous reports have also shown that lectins can detect SRRPs with greater sensitivity than antibodies, since the high degree of glycosylation masks the underlying amino acid and protein antigens (<xref rid="cwy100C39" ref-type="bibr">Siboo et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, to confirm the identity of the putative SRRP glycoprotein secreted by <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C, the lectin binding profile of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C <italic>&#x00394;srr</italic> mutant (lacking SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> expression, see (<xref rid="cwy100C16" ref-type="bibr">Frese et al. 2013</xref>)) was determined as above following western blot analysis with <italic>f</italic>-labeled lectins. The protein band &#x0003e;300 kDa recognized by <italic>f-</italic>WGA in the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C wild-type strain was missing in the <italic>&#x00394;srr</italic> mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F1">1</xref><bold>C</bold>) while no other difference in the lectin recognition pattern was observed with <italic>f</italic>-WGA or when the SM proteins were probed with <italic>f</italic>-RCA or <italic>f</italic>-SNA (data not shown), confirming that this protein is SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> (marked with an arrow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F1">1</xref>A). It is interesting to note that the theoretical MW of SRRP<sub>53608</sub> and SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> is 116 kDa and 224 kDa, respectively, therefore the high apparent MW of <italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs is in line with the potential glycosylation of these adhesins. The lectin recognition pattern of <italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs suggests that these adhesins are glycosylated with glycans carrying GlcNAc residues.</p><fig id="cwy100F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Lectin screening of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> SM proteins.

We obtained binding epitope maps (maps of distribution of STD<sub>0</sub>(%) factors along the molecule) for each ligand tested (UDP, UDP-Gal, UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc), reflecting the main contacts with the surface of the protein in the bound state. For each ligand, the highest STD<sub>0</sub>(%) factors were observed for the uracil and ribose moieties whereas the hexopyranose moieties (Glc, GlcNAc and Gal) showed lower STD<sub>0</sub>(%) factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F6">6</xref>G&#x02013;L). In addition, there were differences between the ligand binding epitopes in complex with GtfC<sub>53608</sub> or GtfC<sub>100-23</sub>.

STD NMR titrations were carried out to determine the ligand affinity of GtfC<sub>53608</sub> and GtfC<sub>100-23</sub>.

the protein, NMR experiments were carried out on the intact gSRR-1 protein. NMR assignments of the sugar residues in gSRR1 are reported in Table <xref rid="cwy100TB2" ref-type="table">II</xref> and details of how the assignments were made are provided in the <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data, Figure S5</xref> captions (Supplementary data, <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>). The analysis revealed that GlcNAc was &#x003b1;-linked to gSRR1 and confirmed that both single &#x003b1;-GlcNAc and GlcNAc&#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;6)-GlcNAc&#x003b1; disaccharide side chains were present. In the <sup>1</sup>H spectrum of gSRR1, the anomeric signal of &#x003b2;-GlcNAc appeared as a simple doublet, <italic>J</italic><sub>1,2</sub> = 8.6 Hz, at &#x003b4; 4.54, but the anomeric signal of &#x003b1;-GlcNAc appeared as a broad feature centered at &#x003b4; 4.87. This broad feature consisted of a superposed series of doublets, all with <italic>J</italic><sub>1,2</sub> = 3.9 Hz, but with displaced &#x003b4;H1 chemical shifts in the range 4.91&#x02013;4.85 ppm (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data, Figure S6C</xref>). The displacement arises because the sugars are linked to serine or threonine residues that occupy slightly different environments as a result of the protein secondary structure. By integrating the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;- <sup>1</sup>H anomeric signals (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data, Figure S6D</xref>) it was possible to estimate the proportions of mono- to disaccharide side chains as 64%:36%, in agreement with the result obtained from the released glycans mixture.</p><p>Together these data showed that GtfA, GtfB and GtfC can glycosylate gSRR1 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Detailed NMR analysis of the intact glycoprotein, as well as the released glycans, showed that gSRR1 is modified with &#x003b1;-linked GlcNAc residues and GlcNAc&#x003b2;(1&#x02192;6)GlcNAc&#x003b1; moieties at a ~4:6 ratio with a small fraction of a Hex-GlcNAc species further identified by MS and NMR.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cwy100s7"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein glycosylation is emerging as an important feature in bacteria. Protein glycosylation systems have been reported and studied in many pathogenic bacteria, revealing an important diversity of glycan structures and pathways within and between bacterial species. Studies focused on SRRPs from streptococci and staphylococci have demonstrated that these adhesins are <italic>O-</italic>glycosylated. In these closely related bacteria, glycosylation of SRRPs is initiated by a complex between GtfA and GtfB that adds GlcNAc to the SRR domains of the adhesins while additional GTs, including GtfC, may further modify SRR glycosylation by sequentially adding other glycan moieties onto the GlcNAc core (<xref rid="cwy100C40" ref-type="bibr">Takamatsu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C37" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C51" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>). Here we showed that the gut symbiont <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is capable of performing <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation on proteins, and that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains differentially modify SRRPs. SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> is glycosylated with GlcNAc and Hex-Glc-GlcNAc whereas SRRP<sub>53608</sub> is glycosylated with GlcNAc and di-GlcNAc moieties. <italic>L. reuteri</italic> GtfAB are expected to be involved in the addition of the core GlcNAc to serine or threonine, in agreement with the glycan structure of SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> and SRRP<sub>53608</sub> and with their high sequence homology with other functionally characterized GtfAs (e.g., ~46% identity with GtfA from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4 (<xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>), <italic>E</italic>-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02013;150</sup>). In addition to the SecA2/SecY2 export system dedicated to the glycosylation of SRRPs, a general <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation system has been reported in <italic>L. plantarum</italic> WCFS1 where homologs of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> SecA2/Y2 GtfA and GtfB have been shown to be involved in the addition of a single HexNAc molecule onto the glycosylation site of the acceptor proteins (<xref rid="cwy100C20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>). These two enzymes contain a DUF1975 in the N-terminus which probably mediates the interaction between the two GTs and the target proteins and a GT domain in the C-terminus, as demonstrated for GtfA and GtfB from <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> FW213 (<xref rid="cwy100C46" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Wu 2011</xref>), suggesting a similar mode of action to the SecA2/Y2-specific GtfA and GtfB.</p><p>The glycosylation of SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> with Hex-Glc-GlcNAc is in line with the specificity of GtfC<sub>100-23</sub> to UDP-Glc by DSF and STD NMR. The second Hex (either Glc or Gal) may be the result of another GT present in the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C SecA2/Y2 cluster (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cwy100F5">5</xref>). The number of GTs in the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C SecA2/Y2 cluster exceeds the number of sugars on SRRP<sub>100-23</sub>, as also reported for the pneumonococcal SecA2/Y2 system (<xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>). Here the putative GtfD<sub>100-23</sub> and GtfE<sub>100-23</sub> encoded genes share a similar organization with a GT4 in the N-terminus and a DUF1792 in the C-terminus. In addition, GtfF1<sub>100-23</sub> and GtfF2<sub>100-23</sub> may be part of the same gene separated by a gene encoding a putative transposase, with GtfF1<sub>100-23</sub> encoding a GT4 domain in the N-terminus and part of a DUF1792 domain in the C-terminus and GtfF2<sub>100-23</sub> encoding the remaining part of the DUF1792 domain. Glycosyltransferases possessing a DUF1792 has been shown to be involved in the third glycosylation step of the SRRPs, Fap1 and PsrP, from <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> FW213 and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> TIGR4, respectively (<xref rid="cwy100C48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>). While DUF1792 has been shown to expand the Fap1 glycan with Glc moieties in <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>), DUF1792 from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> showed a relaxed specificity transferring either Glc or Gal to SRR1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>). As all additional GTs in the <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C SecA2/Y2 cluster contain such a domain, it is possible that only one of these enzymes is active or that there is redundancy in their function. Taken together with the SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> enzymatic deglycosylation data, it is likely that SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> is modified by Glc-Glc-GlcNAc or Gal-Glc-GlcNAc. Interestingly, the Glc-GlcNAc intermediate could not be identified by MALDI-ToF analysis, suggesting that the addition of the third monosaccharide onto the expanding glycan is a rapid reaction, as observed for Fap1 in <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> FW213 (<xref rid="cwy100C48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>To date, all characterized GtfCs have been shown to add a Glc residue onto the GlcNAc core, therefore the glycosylation of SRRP<sub>53608</sub> by di-GlcNAc was unexpected. The specificity of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> GtfC<sub>53608</sub> was further supported by DSF and STD NMR analyses, showing a preference for UDP-GlcNAc, in line with the MS/GC&#x02013;MS analyses. This is therefore the first report of a GtfC from the SecA2/Y2 system showing ligand specificity to UDP-GlcNAc. In addition, we showed that GtfC<sub>53608</sub> (and GtfC<sub>100-23</sub> to a lesser extent) bound to divalent ions, suggesting that they may contribute to optimum enzyme activity. Although these enzymes do not possess the DxD motif, commonly involved in ion binding, they harbor a DxE motif that could have a similar role. Such dependency for divalent ions is well established in Leloir GTs, and some examples have recently been reported in prokaryotic systems such as the dGT1-mediated glycosylation of Fap1 in <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>). However, no divalent ions have been identified so far in GtfCs from other microorganisms (<xref rid="cwy100C50" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. 2011</xref>).</p><p>SRRP<sub>53608</sub> glycosylation was further confirmed by the introduction of GtfA/B/C<sub>53608</sub> into <italic>E. coli</italic>, resulting in glycosylation of a co-expressed SRR1 domain by mono- and di-GlcNAc, as shown by MS and NMR. Heterogeneity in the glycosylation of SRRPs has been reported in SRR glycoproteins from <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species (<xref rid="cwy100C6" ref-type="bibr">Chaze et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C48" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C9" ref-type="bibr">Couvigny et al. 2017</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al. 2017</xref>), where deposition of GlcNAc moieties is not followed by further elongation of the glycan, suggesting this is a common feature among SRRPs. This heterogeneity was also observed in the glycosylation of SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> (see Results section) and could explain the recognition of SRRP<sub>100-23</sub> by WGA.</p><p>The NMR analysis also indicated that SRRP<sub>53608</sub> is glycosylated with GlcNAc&#x003b2;(1&#x02192;6)-GlcNAc&#x003b1; moieties, providing a unique example of SRRP glycans extended with GlcNAc residues in the second position. Although only so far reported for GlcNAc residues that are directly attached onto the protein backbone, it is possible that SRRP<sub>53608</sub> contains additional <italic>O</italic>-acetyl group moieties as previously identified in SRRPs from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> M99 (<xref rid="cwy100C34" ref-type="bibr">Seepersaud et al. 2017</xref>), <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> H36b (<xref rid="cwy100C6" ref-type="bibr">Chaze et al. 2014</xref>) and <italic>S. salivarius</italic> JIM8777 (<xref rid="cwy100C9" ref-type="bibr">Couvigny et al. 2017</xref>). In these <italic>Streptoccocus</italic> SRRPs, Asp2 was found to be responsible for this modification, probably on the O-6 position (<xref rid="cwy100C34" ref-type="bibr">Seepersaud et al. 2017</xref>). Since <italic>L. reuteri</italic> SecA2/Y2 clusters harbor a gene encoding a predicted Asp2 with conserved catalytic residues, Asp2 may also carry out this function in <italic>L. reuteri</italic>. However, since the <italic>O</italic>-AcGlcNAc modification is lost under the conditions used in our MALDI-ToF or GC&#x02013;MS analyses (the high pH used for the release of the glycans leads to base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis and thus loss of the modification), more work is required to establish whether Asp2 functions as an acetyltransferase that modifies GlcNAc moieties of SRRP<sub>53608</sub>. The &#x003b1;-linked configuration we demonstrated here for the first time for an SRRP is in agreement with the retaining mechanism reported for GtfA from <italic>S. gordonii</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. 2016</xref>) and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C37" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a small fraction of the gSRR1 glycans consisted of Hex-HexNAc moieties, a modification that was not found on the native protein. This suggests that GtfC could mediate the transfer of either Glc or GlcNAc in the <italic>E. coli</italic> glycosylation model, while showing a preference for GlcNAc in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608, in agreement with the enzyme donor specificity and the increased levels of UDP-GlcNAc in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> ATCC 53608.</p><p>In <italic>L. reuteri</italic> 100-23C, the <italic>&#x00394;asp2</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;gtfB</italic> mutants lost the WGA band corresponding to SRRP<sub>100-23</sub>, indicating that, in this strain, Asp2 and GtfB are essential for glycosylation and/or export of SRRP<sub>100-23</sub>. In <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, Asp2 is involved in both the post-translational modification and transport of SRR glycoproteins during their biogenesis (<xref rid="cwy100C47" ref-type="bibr">Yen et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C33" ref-type="bibr">Seepersaud et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C34" ref-type="bibr">Seepersaud et al. 2017</xref>). This requirement for the coupling of glycosylation and secretion has been proposed as a mechanism underpinning the co-evolution of SRR glycoproteins with their dedicated accessory SecA2/Y2 system such that the adhesin is optimally modified for binding (<xref rid="cwy100C33" ref-type="bibr">Seepersaud et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that <italic>Lr</italic>SRRP adhesins are differentially glycosylated in <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains 100-23C and ATCC 53608, reflecting differences in the organization of the SecA2/Y2 accessory cluster of these strains. In addition, <italic>Lr</italic>SRRPs from pig and rodent strains differ with respect to the number of repeat motifs and their sequences of their SRR regions (<xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). The glycosylation of SRRPs in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, as demonstrated for the first time in this study, is likely to impact on the adhesion capacity of these strains. A recent analysis of all available genomes of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> strains showed that homologs of functional SRRPs (and the corresponding linked SecA2/Y2 gene cluster) were exclusively found in rodent and pig isolates, with the exception of one chicken isolate (<xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>). Differences in <italic>Lr</italic>SRRP glycosylation profile may therefore contribute to the mechanisms underpinning <italic>L. reuteri</italic> adaptation to these hosts. In addition, bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of complete SecA2/Y2 clusters with an intact SRRP in the genomes of other <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species including strains from <italic>Lactobacillus oris</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus johnsonii</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus fructivorans</italic> (<xref rid="cwy100C19" ref-type="bibr">Latousakis and Juge 2018</xref>; <xref rid="cwy100C36" ref-type="bibr">Sequeira et al. 2018</xref>), suggesting a common role of SRR glycoproteins in adhesion to host epithelia, which may be related to the ecological context of these strains (see <xref rid="cwy100C10" ref-type="bibr">Duar et al. (2017</xref>) for a review). This aspect can be particularly important in the selection of probiotics targeting different vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, knowledge of the cellular pathways of glycosylation in gut symbionts expands the range of glycoengineering applications for the recombinant production of glycoprotein conjugates in different cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cwy100s8"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="cwy100s9"><title>Materials, strains and culture conditions</title><p>Uridine diphosphate (UDP), UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA), UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Gal), thymidine diphosphate (TDP)-Glc and all chemical reagents were from Merck (Gottingen, Germany), unless stated otherwise.
