Thus, automated, non-destructive methods of phenotyping rice tiller traits at a high spatial resolution and high throughput for large-scale assessment of rice accessions are urgently needed. In this study, we developed a high-throughput micro-CT-RGB imaging system to non-destructively extract 739 traits from 234 rice accessions at nine time points. We could explain 30% of the grain yield variance from two tiller traits assessed in the early growth stages. A total of 402 significantly associated loci were identified by genome-wide association study, and dynamic and static genetic components were found across the nine time points. A major locus associated with tiller angle was detected at time point 9, which contained a major gene, <italic>TAC1</italic>. Significant variants associated with tiller angle were enriched in the 3&#x002b9;-untranslated region of <italic>TAC1.</italic> Three haplotypes for the gene were found, and rice accessions containing haplotype H3 displayed much smaller tiller angles. Further, we found two loci containing associations with both vigor-related traits identified by high-throughput micro-CT-RGB imaging and yield. The superior alleles would be beneficial for breeding for high yield and dense planting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dynamic phenotyping</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>high throughput</kwd><kwd>longitudinal traits</kwd><kwd>micro-CT-RGB</kwd><kwd>plant phenomics</kwd><kwd>rice tiller</kwd><kwd>tiller traits</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Research and Development Program</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0100101-18</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31770397</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fundamental Research Funds</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2662017PY058</award-id><award-id>BB/J004464/1</award-id><award-id>BB/CAP1730/1</award-id><award-id>BB/CSP1730/1</award-id><award-id>BB/R02118X/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice is one of the most important food crops both in China and worldwide (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2008</xref>). Selecting plants with the ideal tiller structure, particularly in terms of tiller angle and number. was a key issue in domesticating rice and improving its yield (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). With the rapid development of functional genomics and molecular breeding, the ability to quickly screen thousands of lines for targeted phenotypic traits under different growth conditions is important (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Fiorani and Schurr, 2013</xref>). Manual phenotyping methods of tiller traits, such as counting tillers, determining whether they are potentially reproductive, and measuring the tiller angles with a protractor, are time consuming and labor intensive, and potentially damaging, and so delay the development of rice genomics for these important characters (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Houle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Furbank <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). To bridge this gap, progress in the development of high-throughput phenotyping technology is required to accelerate gene discovery and assist with rice breeding (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Tiller numbers and angles are two key components of plant architecture that affect the grain yield of rice (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Springer, 2010</xref>). Tiller number largely determines the panicle number, a key component of yield. Many tiller-related genes have been identified in recent years, such as <italic>MOC1</italic>(<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), <italic>OsTB1</italic>(<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Takeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), and <italic>IPA1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Jiao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). These genes are involved in the initiation and outgrowth of axillary meristems, and in the auxin and strigolactone signaling pathway that controls rice tillering (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Takeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). MicroRNAs are also involved in rice tillering by regulating the expression of target genes (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). <italic>MOC1</italic>, which was first isolated and characterized in the context of the control of rice tillering, positively regulates tiller number by initiating axillary buds and promoting their outgrowth (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Tiller angle, which determines the ideal plant architecture and thus grain yield (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Sang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), has undergone improvement during domestication. Small tiller angles make plants more efficient in photosynthesis and increase radiation use efficiency, and also allow denser planting during rice cultivation (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Several tiller-angle related genes, such as <italic>TAC1</italic>, <italic>TAC3</italic>, <italic>OsLIC</italic>, and <italic>PROG1</italic>, have been identified and characterized (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Jin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). <italic>TAC1</italic> is a major gene that was identified by forward genetics as positively controlling tiller angle (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). A variant in the 3&#x002b9;-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene changes the mRNA level, and higher mRNA levels contribute to a larger tiller angle. Based on previous studies, nucleotide diversity in <italic>TAC1</italic> is low, and only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region has been found, resulting in synonymous substitution in 113 cultivated rice varieties. The small-angle allele of <italic>TAC1</italic> exists only in the <italic>japonica</italic> accessions (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent improvements in detector arrays and micro-focus X-ray tubes have allowed the development of computed tomography (CT) to produce micro-CT (also termed high-resolution CT), which can non-invasively scan the internal three-dimensional (3D) structure of plant tissues and organs (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Stuppy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). With the addition of appropriate methods and specific image analysis, both 3D visualization and volumetric measurements of plant tissues or organs can be obtained. High-resolution CT was able to visualize the 3D vessel networks of dry grapevine stems (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brodersen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and vascular bundles of cut maize stalks (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), in which the reconstructed results were close to those acquired by electron microscopy. Micro-CT can also be used to quantify floral traits (numbers of pollen grains and ovules; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Staedler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and wheat grain traits (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Hughes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), and thus has the potential to replace labor-intensive manual counting. Using different sample holders and appropriate X-ray energies, 3D structures of different sizes, including plant buds and inflorescences, barley spikes, and whole barley plants, can be measured using micro-CT (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tracy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>); this application demonstrated that micro-CT can be used to measure successive flower development and spike growth in a non-destructive manner. Moreover, the tiller number and spike length of barley can be manually counted using the projected X-ray images (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tracy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, manual counting using projected X-ray images is not suitable for tiller counting in large populations (particularly those with high tiller numbers), and tiller growth traits cannot be measured on projected X-ray images.</p><p>The rapid development of high-throughput phenotyping technologies such as field high-throughput phenotyping (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Jose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and cell to whole-plant phenotyping (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Stijn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) has accelerated the genetic mapping of important agronomic traits in crops. Using the precision field phenotyping platforms, quantitative trait loci for controlling biomass were identified in triticale (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Busemeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The panicle-related image-analysis pipeline PANorama promoted the genetic dissection of rice panicle traits (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Crowell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Given the abundant genetic variation in natural populations, combinations of high-throughput phenotyping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to reveal the natural genetic variation and to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits such as biomass, grain yield, leaf traits, panicle, and salinity tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, 2015; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tamimi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Crowell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we developed a high-throughput micro-CT-RGB (HCR) imaging system combining CT and RGB imaging in one chamber to extract tillering traits, with high spatial resolution (97 &#x003bc;m) and high efficiency (~310 plants per day). A panel containing 234 rice accessions was phenotyped non-destructively at nine time points during the tillering process, and 739 traits were extracted by HCR and used to perform GWAS. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between tiller senescence and drought resistance, and dynamically screened changes in tillering under drought stress. Our results demonstrate that combining HCR and GWAS provides new insight into the genetic basis of rice tillering and architecture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and experimental design</title><p>In this study <italic>indica</italic> rice accessions were used because of their higher genetic diversity than <italic>japonica</italic> subpopulations (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The experiment aimed to measure as many genotypes as possible. Measurements of replicate plants for each genotype had high repeatability (<italic>w</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.89) based on data from our previous study (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) using the same rice accessions under similar cultural and environmental conditions to those of the current study. On this basis, in the current study one rice plant of each genotype was measured with the HCR imaging system. Genotype and phenotype information for the 234 accessions was retrieved from the RiceVarMap v2.0 website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn/v2/">http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn/v2/</ext-link>). Detailed cultivar information for the 234 accessions was obtained from the same website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn/v2/cultivars/">http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn/v2/cultivars/</ext-link>). The genotype identity, cultivar name, and all phenotypic traits are tabulated in Dataset S1 available at Dryad Digital Repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gm18v5f">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.gm18v5f</ext-link>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Seeds from the accessions were sown in the field on 25 May 2015 and transplanted into pots on 16 June 2015. Each pot was filled with 5 kg soil (pH 5.45, total nitrogen 0.241 g kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, total potassium 7.20 g kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, total phosphorus 0.74 g kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen 144.06 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, available potassium 188.64 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, available phosphorus 16.81 mg kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, organic matter 46.55 g kg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). During the tiller elongation stage (~41&#x02013;67 days after sowing), the 234 accessions were automatically measured every 3 days (nine times in total) using HCR. At the mature stage, the effective tiller number was counted manually from the reconstructed transverse section of tiller images. After harvest, 203 plants were oven-dried and weighed to obtain the shoot dry weight. Then, the 203 rice plants were threshed and then inspected by using a yield traits scorer (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) to measure the grain yield. In addition, 35 plants and plastic pipes (see Fig. S1 available at Dryad) were processed by HCR and then manually measured to assess the comparability of HCR with manual measurements.</p><p>Comparisons of the manual and HCR measurements were made using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), defined as follows:</p><disp-formula id="M1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="M2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:munderover><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math><label>(2)</label></disp-formula><p>Where <italic>n</italic> is the total number of measurements, the subscript a refers to HCR measurements, the subscript m refers to manual measurements, and the subscript i refers to the one of the <italic>n</italic> measurements on a nominated character.</p><p>To investigate the implications of tiller senescence for yield and drought resistance, three drought-resistance traits (stay-green trait, leaf-rolling trait, and leaf water content) of 100 <italic>indica</italic> rice accessions assessed in our previous work were re-analyzed (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and compared with the tiller senescence of the same 100 accessions in the present study.

In this work, three drought resistance traits, including the stay-green trait (green projected area ratio; GPAR), leaf-rolling trait (total projected area/bounding rectangle area ratio; TBR), and leaf water content were re-analyzed. GPAR_R is calculated as the ratio of GPAR under drought stress to the value before drought stress; a higher GPAR_R indicates higher drought tolerance. TBR_R is calculated as the ratio of TBR under drought stress to the value before drought stress. TBR_R is related to the leaf-rolling trait, and a lower TBR_R indicates higher drought avoidance. The three drought resistance traits were compared in the two tiller senescence groups (i.e. 50 higher and 50 lower-senescence accessions).

Some non-destructive methods of tiller measurement based on two-dimensional (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Boyle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) or 3D-RGB imaging (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) have shown that RGB computer vision approaches can be used to estimate tiller number. However, since the tillers usually overlap each other, RGB imaging is affected by occlusion and cannot accurately detect the innermost tillers even if plants are rotated for multi-angle imaging. The estimation error of RGB imaging methods becomes larger with increasing tiller number because of increasing occlusion. Projected X-ray images obtained by CT overcomes the problem of occlusion, and the tiller numbers can be manually counted (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tracy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, manual counting is not ideal for measuring large populations, particularly with large tiller numbers. In addition, tiller size and growth traits cannot be measured from projected X-ray images, and micro-CT is needed to measure these traits.</p><p>Our approach, using high-throughput imaging of tiller inner structure with good resolution and the corresponding image analysis pipeline for tiller traits, provides the data required for GWAS.
