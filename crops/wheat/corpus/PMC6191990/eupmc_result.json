    "Background:This experiment was conducted to study the effect of different feed enzymes (phytase, xylanase, β-glucanase) on release rate of trace elements (Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn) in 6 commonly used feedstuffs (corn, wheat, barley, soybean meal, wheat bran, wheat middlings) by using an in vitro model, simulating the digestive processes in stomach for 2 h and then in small intestine for 6 h at 39 °C. Results:Phytase raised (P < 0.05) the release rate of Cu and Zn in corn, Cu, Zn and Mn in wheat, Cu in barley, Cu, Zn and Mn in soybean meal, Zn, Fe in wheat bran and Zn, Fe, Mn in wheat middlings. The release rate of various trace elements in feedstuffs was increased after xylanase addition. Compared with the control group, the release rate of soluble Cu in corn, wheat, barley and soybean meal, soluble Zn in corn, wheat and wheat middlings and soluble of Mn in corn, wheat, barley and wheat bran increased (P < 0.05) after xylanase treatment. After the treatment of β-glucanase, the release rate of soluble Cu in corn, wheat and wheat bran, soluble Fe in barley, soybean meal and wheat bran and soluble Mn in corn and wheat bran all increased (P < 0.05) compared with the control group. In each feedstuff, after corresponding enzyme treatment, the contents of phytic acid, xylan and β-glucan were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions:Results showed that bound trace elements in feedstuffs can be released by feed enzymes. It may be necessary to take the trace elements in feedstuffs into account in the actual feed preparation including feed enzymes."
