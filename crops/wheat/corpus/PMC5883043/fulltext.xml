The objective of this study was to explore a rapid method for evaluating seed vigor. To analyze the correlation of seed traits and seedling traits related to seed vigor, we designed five experiments including nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation and seed sorting treatments in wheat. The results showed that only the absolute content of protein (ACP) in wheat seed was significantly correlated with plant dry weight in five experiments. Subsequently, another experiment including 30 wheat seed lots was used to validate the above results. Although 100-grain weight was also correlated with plant dry weight (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.799, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), the correlation coefficient was lower than that between ACP in seed and plant dry weight (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.897, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Moreover, the results of three experiments using maize seeds was similar with above. The relative content of protein in seed detected by near-infrared spectrum combining with seed weight could realize rapid and nondestructive testing ACP in seed. Collectively, ACP in crop seed could be applied in rapid evaluation of seed vigor and could potentially be used for processing and screening high vigor seeds.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Seed vigor determines the potential for rapid and uniform emergence of plants under a wide range of field conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

To study if there is a seed trait can be used to evaluate plant dry weight and seed vigor, we designed a series of experiments. In each experiment, we first tested 100-grain weight and the relative content of protein (RCP, %) in seed and then calculate the absolute content of protein (ACP, mg seed<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in wheat seed. Moreover, we used standard germination test to detect plant dry weight and seed vigor. In experiment A, wheat seed produced under different nitrogen level (four nitrogen level: 0&#x02009;kg/ha, 168&#x02009;kg/ha, 240&#x02009;kg/ha (the usual nitrogen fertilizer level for winter wheat production in the North China Plain) and 300&#x02009;kg/ha). Correlation analysis showed that RCP in wheat seed was significantly correlated with 100-grain weight and ACP in wheat seed, and plant dry weight was remarkably correlated with ACP in wheat seed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Wheat seeds coming from big spike of experiment A were used in experiment B, and correlation analysis result was consistent with that in experiment A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Wheat seeds in experiment C and D came from different parts of spike (top 1/4, middle 1/3 and bottom 1/4) under N0 and N240 treatments, respectively. Among these seeds, there were significantly different in plant dry weight and seed vigor. Correlation analysis of experiment C and D showed that there was no significant correlation between 100-grain weight and RCP in wheat seed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,D</xref>). Wheat seed produced under different irrigation after anthesis (two water level: normal irrigation and no irrigation with control rainfall) was used in experiment E.

The method need grind seed and relative long testing time, which is difficult to meet rapid and nondestructive testing seed vigor. In this study, we used near-infrared spectrum to detect RCP in seed and then multiply RCP in seed by seed weight to calculate ACP in seed. ACP in seed could be used to predict plant dry weight and seed vigor.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, the absolute content of protein in wheat seed and maize seed was significantly correlated with plant dry weight at seedling stage. RCP in crop seed detected by near-infrared spectrum combining with seed weight could realize rapid and nondestructive ACP in crop seed. Thus, ACP in crop seed could be applied in rapid evaluation of seed vigor and plant dry weight at seedling stage within the same crop. Moreover, ACP in crop seed could potentially be used to process and screen high vigor seeds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par17">Wheat seeds were produced in field trials in Dongwu Village (35&#x000b0;57&#x02032;N and 117&#x000b0;3&#x02032;E, Dawenkou Town, Tai&#x02019;an City, Shandong Province, China) during the period of wheat growth (October&#x02013;June) in 2014&#x02013;2015 and 2015&#x02013;2016. Wheat seeds came from several experiments with nitrogen fertilizer application treatments (2014&#x02013;2015), irrigation treatments (2015&#x02013;2016) and normal regional trial (2015&#x02013;2016). We set four nitrogen fertilizer levels (0&#x02009;kg/ha, 168&#x02009;kg/ha, 240&#x02009;kg/ha (the usual nitrogen fertilizer level for winter wheat production in the North China Plain) and 300&#x02009;kg/ha in nitrogen fertilizer experiment. In other experiments, 240&#x02009;kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer was applied. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied at rates of 120&#x02009;kg/ha P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and 75&#x02009;kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Base fertilizer was composed of 40% nitrogen fertilizer, 100% phosphorus fertilizer and 60% potassium fertilizer. At jointing stage, the residual 60% nitrogen fertilizer and 40% potassium fertilizer were used as topdressing. Irrigation, diseases, and insect pests were adequately controlled. Maize seeds were produced in the field trials during the period of maize growth (June&#x02013;October) in 2015. Maize seeds came from several experiments with irrigation treatments. After anthesis, we set two water level, i.e. normal irrigation and no irrigation with control rainfall. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied before sowing at rates of 75&#x02009;kg/ha P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and 100&#x02009;kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied as topdressing at jointing stage (60&#x02009;kg/ha) and large-bell stage (60&#x02009;kg/ha), respectively.
