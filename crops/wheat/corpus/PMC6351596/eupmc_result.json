    "Soil microelement deficiency and heavy metal contamination affects plant growth and development, but improving trace element uptake and reducing heavy metal accumulation by genetic breeding can help alleviate this. Cell number regulator 2 (TaCNR2) from common wheat (Triticum aestivum) are similar to plant cadmium resistance proteins, involved with regulating heavy metal translocation. Our aim was to understand the effect of TaCNR2 on heavy metal tolerance and translocation. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR indicated TaCNR2 expression in the wheat seedlings increased under Cd, Zn and Mn treatment. Overexpression of TaCNR2 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced its stress tolerance to Cd, Zn and Mn, and overexpression in rice improved Cd, Zn and Mn translocation from roots to shoots. The grain husks in overexpressed rice had higher Cd, Zn and Mn concentrations, but the brown rice accumulated less Cd but higher Mn than wild rice. The results showed that TaCNR2 can transport heavy metal ions. Thus, this study provides a novel gene resource for increasing nutrition uptake and reducing toxic metal accumulation in crops."
