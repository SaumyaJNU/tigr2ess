Quantitative proteomics analysis has been applied in the study of crop abiotic stress as an effective way in recent years (e.g. salt stress, drought stress, heat stress and waterlogging stress). However, only a few proteins related to primary metabolism and signal transduction, such as UDP - glucose dehydrogenase, UGP, beta glucosidases, were reported to response to waterlogging stress in wheat. The differentially expressed proteins between genotypes of wheat in response to waterlogging are less-defined. In this study, two wheat genotypes, one is sensitive to waterlogging stress (Seri M82, named as S) and the other is tolerant to waterlogging (CIGM90.863, named as T), were compared in seedling roots under hypoxia conditions to evaluate the different responses at proteomic level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">A total of 4560 proteins were identified and the number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were 361, 640, 788 in S and 33, 207, 279 in T in 1, 2, 3&#x02009;days, respectively. These DEPs included 270 common proteins, 681&#x02009;S-specific and 50&#x02009;T-specific proteins, most of which were misc., protein processing, DNA and RNA processing, amino acid metabolism and stress related proteins induced by hypoxia. Some specific proteins related to waterlogging stress, including acid phosphatase, oxidant protective enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, were significantly different between S and T. A total of 20 representative genes encoding DEPs, including 7 shared DEPs and 13 cultivar-specific DEPs, were selected for further RT-qPCR analysis. Fourteen genes showed consistent dynamic expression patterns at mRNA and protein levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Proteins involved in primary metabolisms and protein processing were inclined to be affected under hypoxia stress. The negative effects were more severe in the sensitive genotype. The expression patterns of some specific proteins, such as alcohol dehydrogenases and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, could be applied as indexes for improving the waterlogging tolerance in wheat. Some specific proteins identified in this study will facilitate the subsequent protein function validation and biomarker development.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5405-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.</kwd><kwd>Hypoxic stress</kwd><kwd>Waterlogging tolerance</kwd><kwd>Proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Nature Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>31471496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wenying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par9">High rainfall, combined with poor soil structure, usually causes severe waterlogging which is one of the main global abiotic stresses limiting crop production. About ten million ha of the wheat growing areas are affected by waterlogging each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], especially in the irrigated rice-wheat growing environments of south and southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Waterlogging negatively affects the root system, which restrains the growth of plants, and eventually affects the yield of crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, and microelement toxicities are considered as the main factors caused by waterlogging. Severe hypoxia or anoxia in the root zone is the most serious factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When plants are transferred from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration under low oxygen conditions, low availability of ATP slows down the growth and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even though stress responses may occur in the early stages of hypoxia, such as the formation of aerenchyma, root cells will remain in a hypoxic state. The death of these cells often leads to the abscission of some roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The decrease in water and nutrients absorption results in lack of nutrition and dehydration in tissues above the ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Stomatal closure of leaves occurs as a result of dehydration and causes reduction in intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. Inhibition of photosynthesis leads to a decrease in the accumulation of dry matter production in crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the denitrification of organic and inorganic soil nitrogen caused by waterlogging, reduced the leaf photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Significant differences in the tolerance to hypoxia stress exist among wheat genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Under hypoxia, tolerant genotypes were found to be better in root growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and morphological adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], such as the formation of more aerenchyma compared to sensitive genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, tolerant genotypes maintained higher physiological and metabolic activities than sensitive ones under waterlogging stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A lot of QTLs associated with waterlogging tolerance in wheat have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Proteomic analyses have been successfully used to study different stresses responses, such as salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and waterlogging stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in various crops. Energy reduction inhibits the synthesis of protein induced by anoxia, leading to changes in gene expressions and protein expression patterns. <italic>TaBWPR-1.2#2</italic>, an important gene related to waterlogging tolerance, was reported to regulate the function of metabolic adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Proteins associated with energy metabolism and stress defense were shown to be waterlogging responsive in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Protein abundances related to primary metabolism and signal transduction changed in the early stages of hypoxia, such as UDP - glucose dehydrogenase, UGP, beta glucosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, Defense proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], such as glycosylated polypeptide, alpha amylase, and signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], such as phosphatidyl ethanolamine binding proteins (PEBPs), were up-regulated after waterlogging treatment. However, most of the previous studies used only one genotype to analyze proteomic changes due to waterlogging stress. In this study, two wheat genotypes contrasting in waterlogging tolerance were selected. The Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling-based quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted parallel on these two genotypes in response to hypoxia for different time points. Further studies were also conducted to confirm the involvement of several selected genes in waterlogging tolerance. This will potentially enable us to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Impact of waterlogging on wheat seedling growth</title><p id="Par13">To show the difference in waterlogging response, hypoxia treatment was performed to mimic the waterlogging condition during wheat seedling growth in both S and T. As expected, hypoxia stress negatively affected the growth of both cultivars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the S and T responded differently to the hypoxia treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The plant height of S was reduced by 20.02, 23.33 and 31.69% at 2, 5 and 8&#x02009;days of hypoxia stress, respectively, while those for T were only 9.80, 8.37, and 3.82%, respectively. It is obviously that hypoxia could reduce the growth of both cultivars within 5 d. The average diameter of roots increased significantly in T (26.6%), but there was no obvious difference in S after hypoxia treatment. The total root length significantly increased by 8.8% at 2 d, while it reduced by 6.1% at 8 d in T. But it reduced from 0 d to 8 d after hypoxic treatment in S (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Effects of hypoxia treatment on the growth of two wheat varieties.

The two cultivars used in this study responded to hypoxia stress very differently at both growth and molecular levels (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), confirming the higher tolerance of CIGM90.863-SH64 to waterlogging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Under hypoxia stress, fewer changes in protein expression patterns were found in the tolerant cultivar compared to the sensitive one (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>General adaptations of wheat seedling in response to waterlogging</title><p id="Par22">Upon the waterlogging treatment, significant changes at morphological and proteome levels started after the first day of the treatment in S while the changes were shown after two days of the treatment in T. The anaerobic adaptations were the common responses in the root cells of both cultivars, which is supported by the results from this experiment that many anaerobic adaptation related proteins such as 4 alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) and 3 fermentation related enzymes were significantly increased during stress. Deficiency of oxygen caused an inhibition of primary metabolisms, including the amino acid synthesis and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this study, a majority of the protein degradation (proteasome and protease related) related proteins increased, whereas, many protein processing (protein synthesis and targeting) related proteins decreased dramatically after waterlogging treatment. DNA and RNA processing (Histones and transcription regulators), and transport related proteins were also significantly reduced after hypoxic stress, possibly due to the lack of energy in root cells to work on the synthesis of nucleic acid and proteins by anaerobic respiration, similar to that reported in maize root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This indicates that waterlogging could inhibit some transcriptional and translation processes and seriously affect the stability of proteins. Interestingly, the secondary metabolism related proteins, e.g. 5 isoprenoids related proteins that participate in the terpenoids synthesis, were significantly increased. Further studies could be conducted to explore the mechanisms for the enhancement of terpenoids synthesis functions in wheat responding to waterlogging.</p><p id="Par23">Under hypoxia stress, both biotic and abiotic stress related proteins were rapidly increased. These proteins include pathogenesis-related proteins, peroxidases and glutathione S transferases, and HSPs. Similar results have also been detected in many other plants, such as soybean, maize, cucumber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Altogether, waterlogging could inhibit primary metabolisms and substance transportation, negatively affects protein stability, and initiates the general stress responsive processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mechanism underlying waterlogging tolerance in wheat</title><p id="Par24">Except for the common adaptions to the hypoxia stress, cultivar-specific responses also could provide some insights into the pathways involved in the sensitivity or tolerance of wheat under waterlogging. Three major aspects revealed by our data may have contributed to wheat waterlogging tolerance enabling long-term survival: the production and consumption of energy; the production of glutathione (GSH); and the metabolism process.</p><p id="Par25">A reduced production and increased consumption of energy are main restrictions for plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Under hypoxia condition, glycolysis pathway produced harmful substances such as lactic acid and acetaldehyde, which could be reduced by alcohol dehydrogenases and fermentation related enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, low degree of glucose metabolism, ATP and NAD+ formation in ethanol fermentation play important roles in helping root cell survival from hypoxia stress. In our study, the abundance of three alcohol dehydrogenase (A9U8G0, W5A4V1, A9U8G5) were increased more quickly in T than that in S, and another alcohol dehydrogenase (A0A1D6DDI9) was reduced only in S by 47.2%. For some metabolic reactions of energy consumption, several proteins related to amino acid, DNA and RNA processing (W5GLX4, A0A1D6DD83, W5CAI0, A0A1D5SY62) maintained a high abundance at the beginning of the treatment, but showed continuous decrease in T and increase in S from 0 d to 3 d after the treatment, indicating more energy consumption in S than T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There were 355 up-regulation and 326 down-proteins in S while only 34 and 16 in T, suggesting that T had a better ability to maintain protein stability and more efficient energy acquisition and utilization after hypoxia stress.</p><p id="Par26">Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in maintaining the function of immune system by its ability in cleaning reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells under hypoxia stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It was reported that glutathione was regarded as an important protective enzyme in several crops under waterlogging stress. In this study, 6 shared proteins related to glutathione transferase were increased greatly in T compared to S. The expression levels Mn-SOD and NADK3, which are responsible for ROS cleaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], increased significantly in T. In this case, T showed a strong ability to avoid oxidation of cytomembrane, which could be one of the key contributors for its waterlogging tolerance.</p><p id="Par27">The metabolism process, including the lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolism, was more active in T than that in S, except for the photosynthesis (PS). The enhancement of primary metabolism is a short-term strategy for plant to escape from waterlogging stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. T Showed a better tolerance through maintaining the expression of stress related genes, including kiwifruit pyruvate decarboxylase 1 gene (<italic>AdPDC1</italic>) which is reported to enhance waterlogging tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The reduced expression of HvPRT6, an E3 ligase in T contributed to its enhanced waterlogging tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Two proteins (C1K737 and W5EPH8) related to ethylene metabolism, a key mechanism for aerenchyma formation, decreased only in S. Similarly, higher expression level <italic>Ta-BWPR1.2#2</italic> and <italic>Ta-BWPR1.2#13</italic> in T lead to a better ability in obtaining oxygen in the root cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. More than 30 proteins showed higher expression levels in T than that in S during the whole process of treatment. These proteins are mainly biotic stress related proteins, including the pathogenesis-related family proteins, jasmonate-induced proteins. In addition, most of the 34&#x02009;T-specific DEPs were metabolism and stress related proteins. Among them, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1 (SAM1, AA1586520) is a protein that creates S-adenosylmethionine by reacting methionine and ATP, participates in the DNA methylation, ethylene biosynthesis and other methylation reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. SAM1 is preferentially expressed in all vascular tissues, stem sclerenchyma and root cortex, and can be induced by several stresses, e.g. NaC1, mannitol and ABA treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this experiment, SAM1 was also induced in T at the second day of treatment, indicating that the SAM1 might also be involved in the hypoxia tolerance in wheat.</p><p id="Par28">In this study, 14 genes showed consistency in transcription and translation level, but 6 genes were inconsistent with the transcription and translation level. In fact, this phenomenon had ever been detected in many researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. There are many factors affecting the regulation of gene expression. Besides regulation of transcription level, post-transcriptional regulation, translation and post-translational regulation all play important roles in the final protein expression. Furthermore, the degradation of RNA, mRNA selective transcription, and protein degradation, modification and folding may lead to the inconsistency between the abundance of RNA and the expression level of protein, for example, miRNA can inhibit protein expression or directly degrade mRNA. This imbalance also emphasized the post-transcription level regulation in seedling stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Potential protein markers for waterlogging stress</title><p id="Par29">In recent years, molecular marker assisted selection has been widely used in crop breeding, which shortens the time of breeding by direct selection of the target traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. As biomarkers, proteins are more diverse, and show more direct and dynamic response to internal control of plants, which has great application prospects in cultivar screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this study, increased expression of 34 proteins, including alcohol dehydrogenases and SAM1, was evidenced in the tolerant genotype under hypoxia stress. Moreover, 51.9% of T-specific proteins significantly increased in the 3 d after the treatment. These proteins may be used as candidate biomarkers for waterlogging tolerance screening. Further, the effective biomarkers could be extensively used to in other cultivars screening.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par30">Waterlogging is one of the main global abiotic stresses limiting crop production, especially for the drought crop wheat. In this study, using two wheat genotypes (Seri M82, sensitive to waterlogging stress and CIGM90.863, tolerant to waterlogging) contrasting in waterlogging tolerance, we first mimicked the waterlogging condition and analyzed the impact of waterlogging on different wheat seedling growth. Then, using TMT labelling technique, we investigated the dynamic response of two wheat genotypes to hypoxia stress at proteomic level. Primary metabolisms and protein processing were found easily be affected and degraded under hypoxia stress, especially in the sensitive genotype. Some important proteins, such as acid phosphatase, oxidant protective enzyme, SAM1, maintained higher expression levels in the tolerant genotype than the sensitive one. These proteins might be used as biomarkers for waterlogging tolerance screening in wheat or other crops.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Wheat genotypes, waterlogging treatment and phenotypic data collection</title><p id="Par31">Seeds of two spring-type wheat genotypes (Seri M82 and CIGM90.863) were collected from International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).
