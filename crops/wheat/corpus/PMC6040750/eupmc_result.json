    "In semi-arid areas of China, the ridge-furrow mulched with plastic film (RF) cultivation system is a common water-saving agricultural technique where the shortage of water resources has become a serious problem. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether this cultivation is actually an improvement over the traditional flat planting (TF) method while testing two deficit irrigation (150, 75 mm) levels to grow winter wheat. Furthermore, we examined the responses of the anti-oxidative defence system and photosynthetic capacity of winter wheat flag leaves under three simulated rainfall (275, 200 and 125 mm) conditions. The results showed that the RF system with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall condition (RF2150) treatment raised soil water content (%) at the jointing and flowering stages and achieved higher net photosynthesis rates (Pn) in flag leaves. Furthermore, such improvements were due to the reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and oxidative damage during different growth stages of winter wheat. The RF2150 treatment significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD); peroxidise (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and the content of soluble protein (SP) during different growth stages of winter wheat. Furthermore, RF2150 treatment attained the highest value at the flowering stage, while also exhibiting significant declines in contents of proline, MDA, H2O2 and O2 in flag leaves. The higher free H2O2 and O2 scavenging capacity and better anti-oxidative enzyme activities under the RF2150 treatment were due to the lower level of lipid peroxidation, which effectively protected the photosynthetic machinery. The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves was positively correlated with SOD, POD, CAT, APX and SP activities, and negatively correlated with proline, MDA, H2O2 and O2 contents. We concluded that the RF2150 treatment was the better water-saving management strategy because it significantly delayed flag leaf senescence and caused the increases in SWC, WUE, Pn, antioxidant enzyme activities and grain yield of winter wheat grown in semi-arid regions of China."
