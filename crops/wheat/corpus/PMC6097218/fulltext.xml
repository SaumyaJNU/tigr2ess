The combined assembly results in 18 super-scaffolds across the chromosome. The value of finished genome regions is demonstrated for two approximately 2.5 Mb regions associated with yield and the grain quality phenotype of fructan carbohydrate grain levels. In addition, the 50 Mb centromere region analysis incorporates cytological data highlighting the importance of non-sequence data in the assembly of this complex genome region.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Sufficient genome sequence information is shown to now be available for the wheat community to produce sequence-finished releases of each chromosome of the reference genome. The high-level completion identified that an array of seven fructosyl transferase genes underpins grain quality and that yield attributes are affected by five F-box-only-protein-ubiquitin ligase domain and four root-specific lipid transfer domain genes.

Unlike previous efforts to sequence the wheat genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) RefSeq v1.0 assembly of pseudomolecules provides a high-quality linear assembly of each chromosome from one terminal region through the centromere to the other terminal region in the form of 70&#x02013;80 super-scaffolds per chromosome. Unlike advanced assemblies of human and model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which all included sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical assemblies, the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 assembly was achieved by combining a primarily whole genome short-read-based assembly with Hi-C, BAC sequencing and genetic/optical mapping information. The algorithmic advances that have made the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 assembly possible leave a final challenge of bringing the local base-level assembly up to a finished status, where the assembly is contiguous at the megabase scale, with no gaps (Ns).</p><p id="Par9">The drive for finishing the human genome has come from the requirement that all genes should be accounted for in order to establish complete coverage for functional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the same way, a finished genome is required to understand the dynamic nature of the wheat genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and its capacity to adapt to hot and dry environments as well as very cold and wet regions, and also to capture genes responsible for traits such as yield, salinity tolerance, faster germination time or nutritional quality for fundamental and translational research. The capacity to adapt and produce grain for a variety of food and non-food products accounts for the prominent position of wheat in the modern industrial supply chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The gene space for chromosome 7A was partially defined by the IWGSC Chromosome Survey Sequencing (CSS) assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and contains genes involved in determining the quality of flour (seed storage proteins, enzymes for starch and fructan synthesis, yellow pigment, preharvest sprouting tolerance) as well as many abiotic responses. Yield is widely acknowledged to be a complex trait, and components that are considered to be stable contributors to this trait include thousand kernel weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and spikelets per spike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], both having significant associations with a region on 7A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other trait components contributing to grain yield such as grains per spike and vernalization requirements, as discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], are also located in the same region on chromosome 7A, and together they define an important candidate target region for finishing. Another region contributing to grain quality (grain fructan content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) provides a second target region. In the assembly reported in the present paper, the centromere, generally considered one of the most challenging regions of the genome to assemble, was also considered using Bionano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] maps to both confirm the assembly and to provide direction for resolving inconsistencies between cytological and assembly data. Manual annotation was performed based on the automated annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (RefSeq annotation v1.1), using alignments of available RNA-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to ensure gene models were consistent with transcriptome evidence.</p><p id="Par10">In the present study, we used the Gydle bioinformatics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gydle.com/">https://www.gydle.com/</ext-link>) software suite to produce an independent assembly of chromosome 7A which integrated a new BAC-based assembly, high-resolution genetic and Bionano map assemblies, as well as chromosome-specific mate-pair data and BAC-based physical maps.

This approach highlights that simultaneous use of sequence and mapping resources generated by different technology platforms allows greater progress towards complete resolution of genome sequences than otherwise possible by using individual technologies.

A major strength of the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 is the long-range organization of scaffolds and super-scaffolds into pseudomolecules. The chromosome 7A scaffolds are made up of 27,657 contigs, with a mean length of 26.2 Kb, and 11.7&#x000a0;Mb of unresolved bases (N) in sized gaps, internal to scaffolds. Hence the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 has a representation of most of the chromosome 7A order and arrangement, but with many small gaps internal to scaffolds and a smaller number of large gaps of unknown size between scaffolds (linkage evidence but no gap size estimation) and between super-scaffolds (no linking evidence). Our Gydle assembly represents 752&#x000a0;Mb of the 7A chromosome, with 711&#x000a0;Mb in near-complete assemblies of the BAC sets, which are ordered and oriented into islands with larger gaps, most of them sized, between BAC sets.

Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> also highlights that in this case the Gydle assembly correctly represents the number of large tandem repeat sequences which are collapsed in the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0. These repeats are documented by Bionano maps and add about 8% to the total length of the region. This observation is consistent with the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 wheat genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] which argued that much of the missing genome length in the assembly was from under-representation of arrays of repetitive sequence units.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Classifying chromosome 7A into 18 connected components</title><p id="Par18">Super-scaffolds define the extent of sequences which are internally connected, ordered and in most cases oriented through underlying data links (physical or Bionano maps) without necessarily establishing the complete sequence in between or gap size.

Some cross-overs in the alignment of the MAGIC and IWGSC genetic maps reflect ambiguities that can arise as a result of the high and distributed repetitive sequence content of the wheat genome combined with the fact that the MAGIC map is based on a multiple cross between 8 modern varieties and the physical map is Chinese Spring. In some cases the map suggested no linkage between markers located in a physical contig. If re-examination of the physical contig indicated a &#x02018;weak link&#x02019; in the physical contig assembly (example shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S3), then the assembly was split into &#x02018;a&#x02019; and &#x02018;b&#x02019; contigs.

Using a stringent approach, these alignments were used to identify potential gap sequences, where only gaps between consecutive mappings of IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 contigs within Gydle contigs were selected both within scaffold and between scaffold gaps. We were able to bridge 82 of the 193 scaffold-scaffold gaps in the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 assembly with Gydle assembly contigs spanning IWGSC v1.0 inter-scaffold gaps. Of these, 26 had a clean mapping of the flanking IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 contigs, suggesting consistency between assemblies for these regions. The reduction of 82 to 26 bridging locations reflects the a priori difficulty expected with these scaffold-scaffold sequences and our conservative approach, with the edges of scaffold assemblies in the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 often conflicting with the Gydle assemblies. For comparison, the same analysis with the Triticum 3.0 (subsequently referred to as PacBio) assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found 88 scaffold-scaffold gaps bridged, with 54 of these in common with the Gydle set, though in only one case were the Gydle and PacBio bridging sequences the same length (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>a, b). These scaffold-scaffold gaps are clearly tractable, although they will require careful resolution, preferably combining other assembly information before bridge sequences can be determined across the wheat genome.

At the macro-scale the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 assembly provided a pseudomolecule against which our independent BAC-based assembly could be aligned, enabling a reduction in super-scaffold number, the completion of super-scaffold ordering and orientations and the local solving of micro-scale inconsistencies and deletions. This capacity enabled, across the whole chromosome, 52 CDSs in the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 to have sections of Ns filled and gene models updated. In target regions, a method that combines multiple resources such as the raw Chromosome Survey Sequencing (CSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], high-density molecular genetic maps ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and Bionano maps was able to produce a finished sequence (<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The Bionano maps were particularly valuable as an independent source of linear sequence information when assemblies conflicted. Two target regions of chromosome 7A were studied in detail to explore the requirements for finishing the genome sequence of the reference assembly at a broader level. These sequences are the largest complete sequences available in wheat and highlight that merging sequences from multiple assemblies to achieve complete finishing is possible but will require the re-referencing, preferably simultaneously rather than sequentially, of the multiple raw datasets and types to provide final validation where assembles agree, and to provide information to resolve conflicts between assemblies as these are found.</p><p id="Par34">One of the 2.5&#x000a0;Mb regions that was finished overlapped the QTL initially defined by Huynh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for fructan content in the grain. In our analysis this region was shown to contain a tandem array of seven glycoside hydrolases (EC 3.2.1, labelled a to g) that were of particular interest since the gene model GH32b could be assigned to 1-FFT on sequence similarity basis and GH32g to 6-SFT. Both these genes are key in the fructan biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The GH32 genes were expressed in the grain and stem and the analysis of variation in grain fructan levels from 900 wheat lines characterized using exome capture indicated that more than half of the SNP variation in the QTL region associated with variation in grain fructan levels located to the GH32 family genes. For the homoeologous GH32 array on chromosome 7D, the most highly significant association across the entire genome was also in this region, and it is thus evident that selection at multiple loci is required for a phenotype such as grain fructan levels.</p><p id="Par35">The region associated with TKW and spikelet number, within the broad yield QTL region on 7AL, required a more extensive integration of the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 and Gydle assemblies. Solving the complete sequence for this region showed that distinct linkage blocks existed in diverse worldwide wheat lines, indicating that fine mapping this region through association analysis will be challenging. The gene families within linkage blocks included repetitive gene models annotated as housing domains involved in apoptosis as well as root morphology; they thus provide targets for establishing a framework for strategies to select for variation which includes variation in copy number, as suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The centromeres of chromosomes have been studied extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in microorganisms, animals and plants. The centromere of 7A was located within the C region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] in chromosome 7A extending from position 240 to 410&#x000a0;Mb (170&#x000a0;Mb, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]) and could be further defined as a 58 Mb region based on the presence of the reverse transcriptase sequence from the Cereba element (AY040832). Except for one unit located at 67&#x000a0;Mb in the telomeric region of 7AS, the Cereba element was unique to the centromere region within 7A. The detailed structure studies indicated that at least two domains for centromere activity existed within the functional domain that was syntenic to the rice chromosome 8 centromere. The centromere region contained 62 genes, and 5 of these genes were also located in the rice chromosome 8 centromere and provided the basis for defining a syntenic functional centromere. Although the CENH3 binding sequences on 7AS were not as clearly defined as in 7AL, we speculate that this is due to a breakdown of the assembly process in the respective region (349&#x000a0;Mb region, see Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The available data suggest the reduced CENH3 protein-antibody binding assayed in both the 7AS and 7AL telosomes (relative to the level of binding to normal chromosomes Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S6) is sufficient for the retention of centromeric activity. The analysis also indicated that the terminus of the 7AL centromere had a terminal 50 Kb duplication of a sequence that is located between the two proposed CENH3 protein-antibody binding domains. In addition, an element, Tai&#x000a0;l (AB016967) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] was found to have 100&#x000a0;units in the region 374.7&#x02013;376.9&#x000a0;Mb (on 7AL) and is unrelated to Cereba or the rice/maize centromere repeats but exists within the Quinta retrotransposable element. In situ hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] shows Tai&#x000a0;l is centromeric to all wheat chromosomes. The incursion of this most recent transposable element (Quinta/Tai&#x000a0;l) is a striking feature here in that the Tai&#x000a0;l sequence is a dispersed repeat in grasses related to wheat and is consistent with it being a recent addition to the wheat genome that has not had enough time to spread more widely. It is possible that new clusters of repetitive elements significantly enhance the network of interactions in which the centromere is involved in meiosis and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Chromosome 7A provided a useful model to carry out analyses that establish a foundation for developing an advanced, version 2.0, high-quality wheat reference genome assembly.

These BAC pools were then shotgun sequenced using Illumina paired-end technology. The BAC pool sequence data were first assembled separately for each physical contig using ABySS, totalling 882&#x000a0;Mb in 74,572 contigs. The BAC pool-based contigs provided the starting point for integrating the various datasets using Gydle software (Philippe Rigault, Gydle Inc., Quebec City, Canada, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gydle.com/bioinformatics">https://www.gydle.com/bioinformatics</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). An initial multiple alignment was produced using the Nuclear software (Gydle Inc.) as part of the hybrid assembly of the available datasets. Reprocessing of BAC pool assemblies identified BAC ends and removed low-quality reads, and thus allowed BAC clones to be identified that were not true components of the respective pools. Vision software (Gydle Inc.) was used to visualize assemblies in a semi-manual curation process with assembly metrics calculated using Perl, R and Shell scripts. An iterative process provided the basis for integrating extensive mate-pair data, Bionano data and KeyGene Whole Genome Profiling (WGP&#x02122;) tags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
