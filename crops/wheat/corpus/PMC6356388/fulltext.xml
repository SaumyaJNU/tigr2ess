Introduction</title><p>Einkorn wheat (<italic>Triticum monococcum</italic>) was one of the first crops domesticated approximately 12,000 years ago in the Near East, alongside emmer wheat (<italic>Triticum dicoccum</italic>). Typically, einkorn was cultivated on marginal agricultural land, being able to survive in harsh environments and poor soils where other types of wheat could not survive. Spelt wheat (<italic>Triticum spelta</italic>) represents a hexaploid series of the <italic>Triticum</italic> genome constitution, which is characterized by great adaptation to a wider range of environments [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When compared to polyploid wheats, it has a higher content of proteins and some well recognised bioactive compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, fructans, tocols, carotenoids, alkylresorcinols, phytosterols, and lower <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> -amylase and lipoxygenase activities [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These compositional traits make einkorn flour a good candidate to provide healthier foods. Specifically, the presence of antioxidant compounds and the protein profile are expected to be related to reduced cardiovascular disease and hypoallergenic effects, respectively. In particular, einkorn was shown to express few T-cell stimulatory gluten peptides, with important implications for celiac disease [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In vitro digested einkorn breads evidenced their higher carotenoid level as compared to modern wheats and showed a greater anti-inflammatory effect than the control (wheat bread) in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given the crucial role of the gut microbiota in the metabolism of dietary compounds, including the bio-activation of plant polyphenols into health-promoting metabolites and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate) from fiber fermentation, as major orchestrators of the host physiology [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is also reasonable to speculate similar health benefits of einkorn in vivo. However, despite a big debate over the last few years on the realistic health potential for humans of the ancient grain landraces cultivated over the world, to date, only a few studies have investigated their in vivo impact [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Specifically, for einkorn, one of the most representative ancient grains, in vitro results evidenced a good healthy potential because of its effects on blood concentrations of glucose and insulin with a view to using einkorn-based foods in metabolic diseases [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but none has considered changes in the microbiota structure as well as in the intestinal repertoire of metabolites, potentially influencing multiple metabolic and immunological pathways that are relevant to host health. In an attempt to bridge this gap, here we explored the gut microbiota and metabolome of pigs fed with an einkorn versus wheat-based bread. Pigs have significant anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, particularly with regard to the intestinal structure, with comparable transit time and analogous digestive and absorptive processes [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, like humans, they are true omnivores, unlike other potential mammalian models, such as dogs, cats, ruminants, rabbits, and rodents, which have evolutionarily developed alternative digestive strategies. Finally, both pigs and humans are colon fermenters and have similar colonic microbiota composition. All of these features make the pig one of the most important models in the field of nutrition [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Through the pig model, in the present study we investigated the impact of a 30-day nutritional intervention with einkorn or wheat bread on the intestinal ecosystem, by means of next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metabolomics of fecal samples, as well as samples from ileal and colonic compartments. The effects of einkorn vs. wheat bread on animal physiology, blood parameters, postprandial glycemia, and insulin response were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-11-00016"><title>2.

Animals and Study Design</title><p>All of the activities performed in this study were regulated by protocols that were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health with D.Lgs n.116/92 and were in accordance with the local guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. The study was divided in two trials: trial 1 (Tr1) that aimed to evaluate glycemic and insulinemic postprandial responses to WB and EB; and, trial 2 (Tr2) that aimed to evaluate intestinal and fecal microbiota and metabolome composition after 30 days of WB or EB dietary trial. The animals, which were purchased at a local farm, were delivered to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bologna University, five days (acclimation period) before the beginning of the experiments. The pigs were all fed with Swine Standard Diet (SSD) during the acclimation period. The standard diet was particularly formulated for pigs between 30 and 80 kg by CESAC s.c.a. Conselice (Ravenna, Italy). The diet composition is reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p><p>In Tr1, four commercial hybrid pigs Landrace x Duroc (females of 50 &#x000b1; 2 kg, fourteen weeks old) were surgically cannulated in the jugular vein with a central permanent silicon catheter (BBraun, Bethlehem, PA, USA) under general anesthesia and stabled in single overhead boxes. For the surgery, the pigs were premedicated with an intramuscular (IM) bolus of ketamine (20 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg). Ten minutes after, when recumbent, venous access was achieved through an auricular vein and the animals were inducted with a bolus of thiopental (0.25 g/animal). The same venous access was used for fluid therapy (Lacteted Ringer, 10 mL/kg/h) and was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Orotracheal intubation was performed using an 8-mm internal diameter (ID) endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (2&#x02013;3%) in a 1:1 mixture of oxygen and air. After a week of recovery, the animals were trained to eat 50 g of experimental bread within five minutes. Training sessions were held at 8 a.m. in the morning, after 15 h of fasting for seven consecutive days. At the end of training period (seven days), in the morning, after 15 h of fasting, pigs were fed with 50 g of experimental bread or 50 g of glucose (liquid solution) as control food (C). Each animal was assigned randomly to a diet (WB, EB, or C) for nine days in order to replicate each diet three times. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein 15 min before the administration of the experimental bread and every 15 min for 2 h to measure glucose and insulin levels.</p><p>In Tr2, twelve pigs (six neutered males M and six females F of 36 &#x000b1; 4 kg, ten weeks old) were randomly divided in four boxes (three animals each box) according to their own gender. For 30 days, the animals were fed twice a day with a 1:1 mixture of experimental bread and SSD, two boxes (n = 6; 3 M and 3 F) with WB and two boxes (n = 6; 3 M and 3 F) with EB. The animals received 1 kg each of mix diet divided in two separated meals, water was served <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The animals were weighed at 0, 7, 14, and 30 days; a score was daily assigned to each box to classify the feces: 0 for normal feces; 0.5 for fluffy feces; and one for watery faces. Fecal samples were collected for each animal as described in sampling session at 0, 15, and 30 days for gut microbiota evaluation and to investigate differences among digestive processes by the NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Blood samples (in K3-EDTA tubes) were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial for clinical evaluation (complete blood count&#x02013;CBC).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-11-00016"><title>2.3. Sampling and Blood Analysis</title><p>In Tr1, the blood sampled from the jugular catheter was immediately analyzed by rapid test glucometer (Contour Glucometer Xt, Bayer S.p.a., Leverkusen, Germany) for the blood glucose detection while the blood for the insulin quantification was collected in a K3EDTA tube and stored at +4 &#x000b0;C until the end of the postprandial sampling period. The K3EDTA tubes were then centrifuged (1000 <italic>g</italic> &#x000d7; 10 min) and the plasma was stocked at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. The insulin level was detected from plasma with a chemiluminescent immunoassay at the Veterinary Clinical Pathology Service of DIMEVET (UNIBO). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and then glycemic and insulinemic index (GI and II) for each diet were calculated by the following proportion [GI and II = AUC food/mean (AUC reference) &#x000d7; 100] [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dietary glycemic and insulinemic load (GL and IL) were calculated taking into account the amount of carbohydrate for each bread [GL and IL = (GI or II &#x000d7; g of available carbohydrate)/100] [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Tr2, blood samples at the beginning and at the end of the trial were collected from jugular vein under general anesthesia with the following protocol: intramuscular (IM) administration of azaperone (2 mg/kg), after 10 min in dark and quite condition an IM bolus of ketamine (40 mg/kg). Venosafe<italic>Q</italic>R plastic tubes for K3EDTA (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) were used for blood sampling, the samples were analyzed at the Veterinary Clinical Pathology Service of DIMEVET (UNIBO) for complete blood count (CBC). For fecal sampling, an operator was standing in the box with the animals. The samples were collected directly when spontaneous defecation occurred before contamination and immediately stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Samples were then stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C until the moment of analysis. At the end of the trial, the animals were euthanized with 0.3 mL/kg Tanax<italic>Q</italic>R (MSD Animal Health Italia, Milano, Italy) under general anesthesia for the sampling of GI content and mucosae (colon and small intestine). Briefly, the digestive tract was removed and separated into its anatomical parts, scraping of the ileum and colon mucosae was performed, as previously described [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-nutrients-11-00016"><title>2.4. Microbial DNA Extraction, Illumina MiSeq Sequencing and Data Processing</title><p>Total bacterial DNA was extracted from feces and ileum and colon mucosal scrapings using the repeated bead-beating plus column method [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with only a few changes [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, about 250 mg of each sample were suspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM EDTA, 4% SDS) and bead-beaten three times in a FastPrep-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA) at 5.5 movements per sec for 1 min, in the presence of four 3-mm glass beads and 0.5 g of 0.1-mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA). After 15-min incubation at 95 &#x000b0;C and centrifugation at full speed for 5 min to pellet raw materials, nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 10 M ammonium acetate and one volume of isopropanol, followed by incubation in ice. Pellets were washed with ethanol 70%, resuspended in TE buffer, and treated with 10 mg/mL DNase-free RNase at 37 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. Proteinase K treatment and column-based DNA purification were performed following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Paired-end sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform, at IGA Technology Services (<uri xlink:href="http://igatechnology.com/">http://igatechnology.com/</uri>; Udine, Italy). Sequence reads were deposited in the MG-RAST database (<uri xlink:href="https://www.mg-rast.org/linkin.cgi?project=mgp87784">https://www.mg-rast.org/linkin.cgi?project=mgp87784</uri>). Raw sequences were processed using a pipeline combining paired-end assembler for Illumina sequences (PANDAseq) [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. High-quality reads were binned into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at 97% similarity using UCLUST [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Taxonomy was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier against Greengenes database (May 2013 release). Chimeric and singleton OTUs were discarded. Alpha rarefaction was performed using the Faith&#x02019;s phylogenetic diversity, observed OTUs, and Shannon index metrics. Beta diversity was estimated by computing weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nutrients-11-00016"><title>2.5.

Partial least squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to reduce data dimensionality and the plots of the first 2 x-variates allowed the visualization of time separation in each group according to Dejean et al. [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Random forest (RF) was used as feature selection technique to identify the molecules that are accountable for discriminating times (t0 and t30) within each diet and diets after the intervention (t30). RF-feature selection was obtained by calculating Importance Scores, i.e., the mean decrease in accuracy as reported by Enot et al. [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Pearson correlation coefficients between the 10 most important molecules identified by RF were calculated.

Postprandial Glycemic and Insulinemic Response</title><p>In a first study trial (Tr1), we determined the postprandial glucose and insulin blood levels after einkorn (EB) or wheat (WB) bread consumption in comparison to the reference food (glucose), by sampling blood from the pig jugular vein up to 2 h after administration (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Postprandial glucose levels differed between WB and EB at minute 15 and 105, with lower values for EB (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.0072 and <italic>p</italic> value = 0.012, respectively; Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test). At minute 15, the postprandial insulin level after WB administration was slightly higher (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.012; Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test) than EB. Glucose and insulin trends are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B. The shape of the glycemic and insulinemic response waves differed between WB and EB, with a biphasic shape for EB, for both glucose and insulin. For each experimental bread as well as for the reference food, the area under the curve (AUC), the glycemic (GI), and insulinemic (II) index and the glycemic (GL) and insulinemic (IL) load were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). GI was 52.1 &#x000b1; 12.1 and 47.5 &#x000b1; 7.7 for WB and EB, respectively. GL was calculated taking into account the percentage of carbohydrate in experimental breads (WB = 60.4%; EB = 59.9%) and it was 31.5 &#x000b1; 7.3 and 28.4 &#x000b1; 4.6 for WB and EB, respectively. No differences were observed between the two diets for GI and GL, but both differed from the reference food (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.018; Kruskal-Wallis test). II and IL were 46.2 &#x000b1; 4.3 and 27.9 &#x000b1; 2.6 for WB, and 51.7 &#x000b1; 3.3 and 30.9 &#x000b1; 2 for EB. The EB consumption resulted in a postprandial II and IL higher than WB (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.01; Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test). According to the peak analysis, the AUC of glucose and insulin first peaks that were produced by EB were lower than those produced by WB, but the difference was statistically significant only for insulin (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.024; Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-11-00016"><title>3.2. Complete Blood Count (CBC), Fecal Score and Body Weight</title><p>In a second study trial (Tr2), we investigated the impact of a 30-day nutritional intervention with EB or WB on the animal physiology and intestinal ecosystem. Data on complete blood count (CBC) and body weight are reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. No significant differences were observed in body increment between the two diets at 7, 15, and 30 days. The body weight increased for both diets from t0 to t15 (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.01; ANOVA for repeated measurements) and reached a plateau phase from t15 up to the end of the trial. Regarding CBC, levels of hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells (RBCs), and reticulocytes increased during the trial from t0 to t30 in both groups, falling within the physiological reference intervals for the swine species [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Inflammation and immunological blood variables were not altered, even though in the first 10 days of the trial, both groups showed mild self-limiting diarrhea, which is likely due to the diet change (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Specifically, the feces were watery during the first week and became fluffy during the second week. A score was then calculated based on stool consistency. According to the fecal score distribution, watery feces were no longer detected since t7 and t15 in the EB and WB group, respectively. In both diet groups, the feces of all pigs were normal in the second part of the trial (t15&#x02013;t30).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nutrients-11-00016"><title>3.3. Gut Microbiota Response to Nutritional Intervention</title><p>Stool samples collected at 0, 15, and 30 days of nutritional intervention (Tr2) were subjected to next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 351,786 high-quality reads (mean per sample, 9772; range, 7207&#x02013;11,734) were obtained and analyzed. Reads were clustered into 16,236 OTUs at 97% similarity. According to the Shannon index, the alpha diversity significantly increased after 30 days of diet in both pig groups, regardless of the type of bread administered (t0 vs. t30, WB, 7.07 vs. 7.58; EB, 6.93 vs. 7.58; <italic>p</italic> value &#x02264; 0.04, Wilcoxon test). Similarly, weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance ordination showed separation between t0 and t30 samples for both the EB and WB group (<italic>p</italic> value &#x02264; 0.003, permutation test with pseudo-F ratios) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). At phylum level, the swine fecal microbiota was dominated almost exclusively by Firmicutes (mean relative abundance at t0, 76.24%) and Bacteroidetes (18.48%), with Actinobacteria (1.67%) and Proteobacteria (1.68%) as subdominant components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Interestingly, both diets resulted in similar increases in the proportion of Spirochaetes, Lentisphaerae, and Tenericutes (<italic>p</italic> value &#x02264; 0.04, Wilcoxon test), but only in the EB group there was a significant modulation of the dominant microbiota fraction, with increased representation of Bacteroidetes and corresponding depletion of Firmicutes (Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio: t0 vs. t30, 5.58 vs. 3.25; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). It is worth noting that this variation was already appreciable at t15 (Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, 2.58; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.002) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). On the other hand, only the WB consumption led to an increase in the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Genus-level taxonomic comparisons confirmed the existence of both common and unique signatures in response to nutritional interventions (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Among the shared features, it is worth noting that both diets, already at t15, resulted in increased abundance of <italic>Treponema</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> species (including <italic>R. bromii</italic>), and bifidobacteria, and diminished proportions of <italic>Coriobacteriaceae</italic> members, <italic>Acidaminococcus,</italic> and <italic>Megasphaera</italic>. Interestingly, only the EB consumption favored the enrichment of the following minor components: <italic>Oscillospira</italic>, <italic>Anaerovibrio</italic>, <italic>Paludibacter</italic>, unclassified members in the GMD14H09 order (Deltaproteobacteria class), and <italic>Blautia producta</italic>. Conversely, the abundances of <italic>Blautia</italic> spp. were significantly reduced in the fecal microbiota of WB-fed pigs, as well as those of other SCFA producers, such as <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic>Dorea formicigenerans</italic>. The WB consumption also led to the reduction of <italic>Collinsella</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Veillonellaceae</italic> (<italic>Mitsuokella</italic> and unknown genera), and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> (<italic>Bulleidia</italic> and [<italic>Eubacterium</italic>]) genera. On the other hand, it favored the enrichment of unclassified members within the Bacteroidales and Clostridiales orders. Finally, yet importantly, after 30 days of nutritional intervention, the fecal microbiota of pigs administered with EB differed from that of pigs fed with WB for a diminished relative abundance of members of the Bacteroidales family S24-7 (EB vs. WB group, 3.24% vs. 5.47%; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.04).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-nutrients-11-00016"><title>3.4. Mucosa-Associated Microbiota from Ileal and Colonic Compartments</title><p>Mucosal scrapings from ileum and colon were collected after nutritional intervention and subjected to 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing, as reported above for fecal samples. A total of 158,871 high-quality reads (mean per sample, 6620; range, 3315&#x02013;9913) were obtained and clustered into 10,560 OTUs at 97% similarity. According to the observed OTU metrics, the ileal mucosa-associated microbiota after 30 days of EB consumption was more biodiverse than after WB administration (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.02, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Similarly, only at the ileum level and only in the weighted UniFrac distance-based ordination space, the mucosal microbial fractions clustered in distinct groups according to diet (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.04, permutation test with pseudo-F ratios) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Unlike feces, the phylum-level microbiota structure of the ileal mucosa was dominated by Firmicutes (mean relative abundance, 39.28%) and Proteobacteria (26.77%), whose proportions were inverted and even more differentiated at the colonic mucosa level (Firmicutes, 16.80%; Proteobacteria, 61.55%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In both intestinal compartments, Bacteroidetes was the main sub-dominant phylum, followed mostly by Chlamydiae in the ileum and Spirochaetes in the colon. Interestingly, when compared to WB-eating pigs, the ileal mucosa-associated microbiota fraction of pigs fed with EB was largely enriched in unclassified microbial members (EB vs. WB group, 42.49% vs. 15.58%; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.02, Wilcoxon test), while profoundly depleted in Firmicutes (24.37% vs. 54.20%; <italic>p</italic> value = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). At the genus level, this difference was mainly attributable to an underrepresentation of <italic>Streptoccoccus</italic> (mostly the <italic>S. alactolyticus</italic> species) and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (mostly <italic>L. ruminis</italic>) in the EB as compared to the WB group. It is worth noting that, although largely subdominant, the species <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> was detected in the ileal mucosal fraction only after EB administration. At the colonic mucosa level, the consumption of EB resulted in a reduced abundance of unknown genera in the <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> family, when compared to the WB-based diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-nutrients-11-00016"><title>3.5. Metabolomics on Water Soluble Fraction</title><p>In order to observe the effects of the two tested diets from a metabolomics perspective, the water-soluble fractions of ileum and colon contents and the feces were studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR). Firstly, we specifically focused on glucose, SCFAs (i.e., acetate, propionate and butyrate), succinate and leucine, whose concentration are known to be strictly related to insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Glucose, succinate and leucine showed decreasing concentrations along the intestinal tract for both diets. Within such a decreasing trend, the WB diet systematically led to a higher concentration of glucose and a slightly lower concentration of succinate at each time point when compared to the EB diet. SCFAs showed marked increases along the intestinal tract for both diets, with the WB diet associated with higher increases of acetate and propionate when compared to EB. As a second step of the metabolomics investigation, we broadened our view by employing <sup>1</sup>H-NMR for an untargeted metabolomics approach. Seventy molecules could be quantified, pertaining to the chemical groups of monomeric carbohydrates, amino acids, SCFAs, and organic acids. Fifteen more molecules could be quantified, with a partially unclear structure, and therefore denoted with the location in the NMR spectrum, expressed in ppm. To evidence the peculiar effects of the two diets, we firstly focused on feces, by calculating the t0&#x02013;t30 variation for each molecule and selecting those showing variations that differed between the two diets with a confidence higher than 90% (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The five molecules so highlighted served as a base for an RPCA model. In the corresponding score plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), PC 1, representing 98.7% of the total variance among samples, summarized the t0&#x02013;t30 variation, with samples pertaining to the EB group at t30 being characterized by the highest scores, and samples pertaining to the WB group at t30 characterized by scores that are very close to those of samples at t0. The relative position on the two groups of samples at t30 was therefore significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), but only the EB group significantly differed from samples at t0 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The correlation plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) evidenced that the most relevant molecule in the underlying structure of the data was succinate. Succinate was the only quantified molecule with a correlation between concentration and importance over PC 1 higher than 0.5. Univariate comparisons between the samples that were collected from the colon and ileum at t30 offered further opportunities to highlight the peculiarities of the two diets. The colon samples from the EB group differed from those of the WB group in the concentration of seven molecules (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). An RPCA model based on these molecules was able to clearly discriminate (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) the samples from the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), with valerate and tryptophan being more concentrated in the WB group, and formate, uracil, and xanthine more concentrated in the EB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). A parallel analysis of ileum contents showed eight molecules to differ in concentration between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f005">Figure 5</xref>E,F; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Table S7</xref>), with lactate, 3-methylhistidine, and molecule X-5.779 being more concentrated in the WB group, and 2-hydroxy-3-methylvalerate, trehalose, 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxobutyrate, and 5-aminolevulinate more concentrated in the EB group.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-nutrients-11-00016"><title>3.6. Metabolomics on Volatile Fraction</title><p>To describe the effects of the two experimental breads (WB and EB) on the fecal volatile metabolite profiles, around 90 volatile molecules were analyzed by solid-phase microextraction&#x02013;gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) in fecal samples before and after the 30-day dietary intervention. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the distribution of volatilomes before and after intervention. The two diets had an opposite effect on metabolite diversity: specifically, the WB diet led to reduced metabolite distribution while the EB diet resulted in increased metabolite diversity in experimental animals. The main metabolite changes of volatile molecules resulting from the Random Forest (RF) feature selection and subsequent Pearson correlation test are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Specifically, the WB diet determined a decrease in 2-octene and 2-butanone (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.005 for both molecules; Wilcoxon test) and an increase in 1-nonanol concentrations (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.005). On the other hand, the EB diet determined a decrease in acetone and 1-octen3-ol (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.005 and 0.013, respectively), and an increase in pentanoic acid propyl ester (<italic>p</italic> value = 0.065) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The out-of-bag (OOB) error rate was 0% for WB and 16.67% for EB. Interestingly, among the 10 most important molecules that are responsible for discriminating between t0 and t30, the WB diet was characterized by the presence of four ketones, whereas for the EB diet the ketones were six (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Among the 10 molecules, identified by RF, discriminating between WB and EB at the end of the trial (i.e., t30), two molecules, 1H-indole-3-methyl and 2-tetradecanol, showed a correlation greater than 0.7 (Pearson correlation showed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-11-00016">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). The concentration of both molecules was higher after the WB diet as compared to EB, but only for 1H-indole 3-methyl the difference was significant, with a <italic>p</italic> value = 0.005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f008">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-nutrients-11-00016"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate in the pig model the impact of wheat (WB) and einkorn (EB) breads on the microbiota and metabolome structure, both in feces and along the intestinal tract, as well as on the glycemic and insulinemic response. According to our findings, both breads evocated an overall similar glycemic response, whereas the insulinemic response, in terms of insulin index and load, was higher after EB administration. Since the carbohydrate content of the breads was very similar, this difference could be attributed to the higher amount of protein in EB as compared to WB [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, as previously highlighted by Abdel-Aal and Hucl [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], alongside with a higher protein content, einkorn products resulted in being relatively low in lysine and high in glutamic acid when compared to other wheat products. Moreover, the gliadin-to-glutenin ratio for einkorn proteins was 2:1, as compared to 1:1 for wheat, indicating some differences in the amino acid composition of these wheats. Other differences that were found in EB included a significantly higher content in lipids, tocols, lutein, and MUFAs and a lower one in SFAs and PUFAs [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Notwithstanding this, the analysis of insulin curves showed a lower peak for EB, suggesting a lower and more constant release of insulin over time, comparable to that of diets that promote a lasting sense of satiety [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the lower glycemic peak induced by EB consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-00016-f001">Figure 1</xref>D), which should evoke a less intense hypoglycemic response. Interestingly, the EB meal led to a biphasic shape for glycemic and insulinemic response waves. The biphasic shape was correlated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in both adolescents and adults [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and recently, with lower cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In a study performed in a pig model of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the prevalence of biphasic glycemic waves was shown to be correlated, as for humans, with female sex [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, the animals enrolled in Tr1 were all females. We did not investigate the mechanism of action that led to the biphasic shape, but as the trial was designed to reduce the individual effect (latin squared design), we can reasonably assume that the biphasic shape was induced by EB. Further studies will be necessary to investigate this phenomenon. With respect to animal physiology, no significant alterations in blood parameters were observed over a 30-day nutritional intervention period (Tr2), except for a physiological increase in hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells, and reticulocytes, which is consistent with normal animal development [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The body increment in the first two weeks of the study was linear for both diets, and was comparable to pig standards [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Conversely, it slowed down from t14 to t30 in both diet groups. Given that for experimental needs the animals received the same amount of food (1 kg die) for all 30 days of the trial, we argued that, from t14, that amount was no longer sufficient to sustain the high growth rate typical of commercial hybrid pigs. Moreover, from t0 to t14, the animals in both groups developed a moderate self-limiting diarrhea, most likely caused by the change of diet. It has indeed been reported that sudden dietary changes can be considered as a nutrition stressor that can challenge animal homeostasis [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and that probiotics and anti-inflammatory diets can help to reduce the effects of this alteration [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interestingly, in the EB group, watery feces were no longer observed from the second week of the trial, suggesting a better and faster recovery from dietary stress-related diarrhea, as compared to WB. These findings are consistent with our previous study in intestinal cell cultures, which highlighted an anti-inflammatory and protective effect for EB, but the hematological inflammatory indexes were not altered [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Probably, we were not able to detect an anti-inflammatory effect observing blood parameters, because the stress that was produced by the change of diet was very moderate and only affected the fecal aspect. A specific trial is needed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of einkorn-based products in the pig model.</p><p>When compared to the WB diet group, the fecal microbiota of EB-fed pigs was found to be enriched in several components that were regarded as health-promoting, including the well-known SCFA producers <italic>Blautia</italic> (acetogenic) and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> (butyrogenic), and <italic>Oscillospira</italic>. Interestingly, recent evidence points to <italic>Oscillospira</italic> as a key member of the gut microbiota, being negatively associated with inflammatory diseases and body mass index, probably through the production of butyrate from dietary or host glycoproteins [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In particular, relative <italic>Oscillospira</italic> abundance was found to increase with the switch to a diet rich in protein and fat [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], thus suggesting an interesting link with the protein and lipid profile of EB, which is worthy of further study. On the other hand, countless studies support the anti-inflammatory properties of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, widely accepted as a biomarker of intestinal health [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but also <italic>Blautia</italic>, which has been associated with decreased inflammation and improved outcomes in several clinical settings, including intestinal diseases, insulin resistance and obesity, and immunological disorders [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is also worth noting that only the EB diet led to increased relative abundances of <italic>Paludibacter</italic>, a propionate and acetate-producing Bacteroidetes member [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and <italic>Anaerovibrio</italic>, a swine commensal microorganism that is known for its lipase activity [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which may support a direct role of this bacterial genus in the degradation of the high lipid content of EB, as compared to WB. The fecal microbiota of EB-fed pigs also showed a decreased relative abundance of the Bacteroidales family S24-7, which includes lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing members with a still unclear role in host physiology, but proven to have the capacity for opportunistic infection under appropriate conditions [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Not least, at the ileum level, the mucosa-associated microbiota fraction after 30-day EB intervention showed increased biodiversity, a community measure proposed as an indicator of eubiosis-associated health [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It is thus tempting to speculate that the consumption of EB could modulate the intestinal microbial profile towards a configuration that is less prone to inflammation, specifically enriched in microbes potentially contributing to maintaining the host homeostasis.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that molecules present in the intestinal lumen due to release from food or produced by the intestinal microbiota may play an active role in glucose homeostasis. In particular, the glucose available in the intestine may be a key factor of the central enhancement of insulin sensitivity for the whole body [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. SCFAs, with specific reference to propionate, acetate, and butyrate, may act as glucose homeostasis regulators both when reaching the liver [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and when produced in the gut lumen [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, succinate and leucine produced by the microbiota have been indicated as potential improvers of glucose homeostasis, in particular succinate is able to induce intestinal gluconeogenesis serving as substrate [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To understand which of these known mechanisms was possibly active in the present study, an investigation by means of <sup>1</sup>H-NMR was targeted to the aforementioned molecules, followed by an untargeted observation of the ileum, colon, and fecal metabolome. This two-step approach highlighted the key role of succinate as the fecal molecule that mostly contributed to the samples pattern. While being equally concentrated in the feces of the animals at t0, succinate was indeed found to be significantly lowered at t30 after the EB diet, suggesting that this molecule was absorbed more efficiently, with potential positive effects on glucose homeostasis. We cannot even rule out a higher rate of succinate utilization by intestinal bacteria [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as suggested by the greater relative abundance of Bacteroidetes members, observed only after the EB diet, which are known to utilize the succinate pathway as the major route for propionate formation [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, the RPCA model revealed that the EB diet had been able to significantly impact on the animals&#x02019; fecal metabolome, while the WB one could not. Confirming such findings, the metabolomes of ileum and colon contents showed significant differences according to diet. Among the molecules mostly contributing to this difference, it is noteworthy to highlight the high importance of tryptophan, more concentrated in the WB group, which is known to play a key role in small intestine motor function as well as in a series of cascade events that are mediated by indolamine dioxygenase (IDO).</p><p>GC-MS analysis reported a quite different metabolic fingerprint for the two diets, with higher metabolite diversity in the fecal samples of pigs that were fed with EB as compared to WB. This is in agreement with previous findings on ancient grains dealing with their effects on the gut microbiota and their metabolites [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, when compared to WB, the volatile metabolome of EB-fed pigs showed a reduced abundance of some alcohols, including 2-tetradecanol and 1-octen-3-ol, and 1H-indole-3-methyl (i.e., skatole), which has been reported to cause tissue damage. Indeed, indole appears as a bacterial metabolite that is produced from tryptophan, highly concentrated in WB diet, as reported above. Higher concentrations of such metabolite may represent a counteraction towards detrimental effects of LPS in the liver upon WB diet, as recently reported by literature [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The reduced presence of alcohols could suggest a reduced production and therefore a reduced risk of endotoxemia, as discussed elsewhere [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. On the other hand, skatole levels have been found to decrease in the hindgut and feces of pigs that were fed with increasing levels of fermentable carbohydrates, leading to increasing SCFA amounts and pH decline, most likely as a result of a reduced presence of skatole-producing bacteria and/or an altered tryptophan metabolism towards indole production [<xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, one of the first bacterial genera identified as a skatole producer [<xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], was found to be largely underrepresented in the mucosa-associated microbiota of pigs that were fed with EB as compared to WB. Among the most discriminating volatile molecules, we also found an increased amount of pentanoic acid propyl ester, as well as butanoic and propanoic acid ethyl esters in the EB-based diet group. In general, the esterification by bacterial metabolism is adopted in the liver, pancreas, and intestine to remove toxic concentrations of metabolites, including SCFAs [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-00016" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which makes their presence a clear consequence of their previous production.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-11-00016"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, through the pig model we demonstrated a beneficial impact of EB on several aspects of the host physiology, including insulin release, fecal consistency, and microbiota and metabolome profiles, both in feces and intestinal contents. According to our findings, the consumption of EB could reduce the AUC of the first insulin peak, thus prolonging the sense of satiety. Moreover, it could modulate the intestinal ecosystem, at both the compositional and metabolic scale, towards a configuration specifically enriched in health-promoting bacteria and showing distinct metabolic signatures potentially contributing to maintaining the host homeostasis. The use of the pig model allowed, unlike in clinical human trials, the sampling of the mucosa and the content of the small intestine, thus widening the knowledge on the complexity of the food-microbiota-host interaction along the gastrointestinal tracts. The observed positive effects could be driven by the synergistic interaction of many factors, including, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the fermentation process, the food matrix, and the flour components, which result in gut-mediated effects. The evaluation of the beneficial effects of a real food is far more complex than using purified compounds, as a direct cause-effect relationship can seldom be ascribed to a single component. It is indeed foods, and not the single components, which create the diet, and exploring their complexity can better reflect their overall role on health. Although further studies and clinical trials are needed, the results that are herein reported represent a first contribution to unravel the anti-inflammatory potential of einkorn-based foods.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-11-00016"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/1/16/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/1/16/s1</uri>.
