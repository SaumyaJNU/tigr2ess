Due to their inherent assembly difficulties, high repeat content, and large ampliconic regions, only a handful of species have their Y chromosome properly characterized. To date, just a single human reference quality Y chromosome, of European ancestry, is available due to a lack of accessible methodology. To facilitate the assembly of such complicated genomic territory, we developed a novel strategy to sequence native, unamplified flow sorted DNA on a MinION nanopore sequencing device. Our approach yields a highly continuous assembly of the first human Y chromosome of African origin. It constitutes a significant improvement over comparable previous methods, increasing continuity by more than 800%. Sequencing native DNA also allows to take advantage of the nanopore signal data to detect epigenetic modifications in situ. This approach is in theory generalizable to any species simplifying the assembly of extremely large and repetitive genomes.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Due to various structural and sequence complexities, the human Y chromosome is challenging to sequence and characterize.

Furthermore, many sequencing efforts have traditionally chosen female samples, as the hemizygous nature of the sex chromosomes leads to half the effective sequencing coverage on both of them in a male, resulting in inferior genome assemblies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Together, these causes have led to an underrepresentation of Y chromosomes in genomic studies and proper characterization of the Y chromosome in only a handful of mammalian species through a time- and labor-intensive clone by clone approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. One strategy to reduce the complexity of the assembly problem for the Y chromosome is to isolate it by flow cytometry, thus dramatically reducing the potential amount of overlaps of repetitive regions in the context of the whole genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding previous efforts, which sought to do this have faced some drawbacks, as the material has been heavily amplified post sorting to increase yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Whole-genome amplification (WGA) introduces biases that are detrimental to genome assembly, such as unequal sequence coverage and chimera formation, as well as limited fragment length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, these methods lead to the loss of epigenetic modifications that can now be directly determined from the signal data from nanopore sequencers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, previous efforts to assemble the Y chromosome purely from flow-sorted material did so using the gorilla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, a species with a previously uncharacterized Y chromosome, meaning that potential biases in the assembly cannot be detected without a gold standard reference to compare with, such as human. Integrating single-molecule sequencing has been shown to produce far superior whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assemblies than sequencing by synthesis platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the MinION sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently been used to create the most contiguous human WGS assembly to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and to resolve the structure of the human Y-chromosome centromere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Given the large volume in which the chromosomes were sorted, and potential issues with residual dyes that are necessary for the sorting process, we devised a purification protocol to bring the DNA into conditions suitable for sequencing. We ran four Oxford Nanopore MinION flowcells to generate 305,528 reads summing to over 2.3&#x02009;Gb of data. The yields per flowcell varied considerably from 897.6&#x02009;Mb to 163.8&#x02009;Mb (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

To check the enrichment specificity, we aligned the reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) and calculated the normalized coverage on each chromosome. Taking into account the size of the Y chromosome and its haploid nature, we find it to be over 110-fold enriched compared with a random sampling from the human genome (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow-sorting and sequencing specificity. <bold>a</bold> Flow-karyogram of a human genome.

To check the completeness of our assembly, we assessed how well each of them is represented. After retaining only single best placements, we were able to align 21.1&#x02009;Mb, or 98.4% of its total length, with 99.9% of identical bases on average (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We recovered the full-length (~&#x02009;99% of the annotated length in GRCh38) reconstructions of both the X-transposed and the X-degenerate regions. Although the X-degenerate region can be considered a single-copy region due its distant common ancestry with the X chromosome, the X-transposed region emerged only after the split between humans and chimpanzees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The largest sequence class on the Y chromosome is comprised of ampliconic regions, which amount to around 30% of the euchromatic portion and sum to 9.93&#x02009;Mb. These regions contain eight massive, segmentally duplicated palindromes, all of which share &#x0003e;99.9% identity between their two copies, with the largest one spanning over 2.90&#x02009;Mb. We find this region to be the most challenging to reconstruct, with fragmented and collapsed sequences, but are nevertheless able to recover 6.14&#x02009;Mb, or 62.7% of its length in GRCh38. Surprisingly, we recover only 78% of the pseudo-autosomal regions (PARs). We observed a rather steep drop-off in coverage coinciding with the PAR-1 boundary on GRCh38. As we are sequencing native, unamplified DNA, the genomic coverage is directly proportional to the number of copies of the underlying sequenced region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We compared the mapped coverage of our raw data on GRCh38 and find that PAR-1 exhibits only around 72% of the average coverage of the whole chromosome (19.8-fold versus 27.3-fold). We observe the drop-off in coverage to coincide sharply with the PAR-1 boundary (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

To this end, we projected all Gencode (v. 27, GRCh38) annotations on the Y chromosome onto our assembly and annotated them there. Due to its peculiar evolutionary trajectory, the gene-space on the Y chromosome is degenerated, and any remaining genes can generally be classified into two categories: on one hand there are single-copy genes, which are broadly expressed beyond the testis. On the other, there are multi-copy genes within the ampliconic regions, which are mainly involved in spermatogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We recover the complete gene set of the genes in the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) region and are therefore able to annotate all single-copy genes. Furthermore, we are able to retrieve at least one member of all multi-copy gene families. For four out of nine of these gene families, we are additionally able to resolve further copies within our assembly (see Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>). We also note that four genes (<italic>ASMTL, IL3R, P2RY, SLC25</italic>) from a comparatively short syntenic block of around 200&#x02009;kb are partially missing from our assembly due to the aforementioned technical challenges in the PAR-1 region. Mapping the raw data onto GRCh38 show that this is an artifact, presumably due to insufficient coverage in this region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Structural variants</title><p id="Par9">We produced a stringent call set of structural variants (SVs) derived from alignments to GRCh38 using Assemblytics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We detect 347 SVs at least 50&#x02009;bp in size (931 variants at least 10&#x02009;bp in size) of which 82 are at least 500-bp long (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The cumulative length of these variants sums to 184&#x02009;kb. We observe a 4.8-fold excess number of deletions versus number of insertions, amounting to a twofold excess of bases in deletions versus bases in insertions. Although a deletion bias for nanopore-based assemblies had previously been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we find the strength of this bias to be decreasing in our analysis, probably reflecting improvements in base-calling accuracy. To check the presence of large-scale copy number variation in multi-copy genes, we additionally determined the chromosome-wide copy number based on a read depth approach using the Illumina data. We find extensive genic copy number variation, with expansions in five of the nine multi-copy genes, when compared with the reference individual. Among these, we find expansions in <italic>RBMY, PRY, BPY2,</italic> and <italic>DAZ</italic>, all members of the AZFc region locus with implications for male fertility. Although these expansions are to some degree represented in our assembly, the precise genomic architecture remains challenging to reconstruct. Due to the high degree of similarity between copies, several of them will be collapsed in the assembly specially in the AZFc region. Finally, to assess concordance with previous studies, we compared our SV calls with those generated by the 1000 Genomes Project, which contains the same cell line used for this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We manually confirm the presence of all structural three variants called in HG02982 in the 1000 Genomes Project in our data by checking the overlap of calls produced by orthogonal approaches (see Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>CpG methylation status</title><p id="Par10">Finally, we called the methylation status of 5-methylcytosines (5-mC) at CpG positions from the Nanopore signal data using a recently developed model implemented in Nanopolish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To assess potential biases on the CpG methylation status introduced by our workflow, we also produced whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data (WGBS) for the same cell line. We calculated the methylation frequency (i.e., the proportion of reads supporting 5-mc at a given CpG) for both datasets. For positions where both datasets have at least 10-fold coverage (<italic>n</italic> = 4654), we observe a good concordance in the methylation frequency with a Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>r</italic> of 0.816 (see Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Remaining differences might be attributable to differences in sensitivity, variation in the methylation state, or alternative modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylation, which cannot be distinguished from 5-mC by WGBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, detecting the 5-mC status on the Y chromosome from long reads in our methodology has the advantage of allowing to interrogate regions that are not accessible to WGBS with short reads, namely the PAR, the X-transposed region, and to some degree the Ampliconic regions. We interrogated the methylation state of CpG 200-bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) in protein-coding genes falling within the different sequence classes of the Y chromosome. Genes from the PAR, X-degenerate, and X-transposed regions are expressed throughout the body, whereas Ampliconic genes have testis specific expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In agreement with these patterns, we find the genes within PAR, X-degenerate, and X-transposed regions to show low degrees of CpG methylation at TSS. Within the Ampliconic regions, the distribution of methylation frequencies of CpGs at TSS shows an overall high degree of methylation and is therefore consistent with the expected downregulation of these genes in lymphoblastoid cells (see Supplementary Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>).

We apply our methodology to assemble the first human Y chromosome of African origin to benchmark our approach. This is arguably the most challenging human chromosome to assemble due to its high repeat and segmental duplication content, and hence a good test-case to explore the possibilities and limitations of this approach. With the exception of bacterial artificial chromosome-based assemblies, we are able to reconstruct the Y chromosome to unprecedented quality in terms of contiguity and sequence class representation. We show that we not only outperform previous efforts that sought to achieve a similar goal of reconstructing Y chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but also accomplish a better reconstruction on all sequence classes than the Y chromosomal sequences derived from a long-read WGS assembly. Additionally, our method is orders of magnitude cheaper than reconstructions from WGS data too, especially considering that twice the desired Y chromosomal target coverage is needed on the autosomes. Given the current developments in sequencing throughput, a single-MinION flowcell should now be sufficient to assemble a whole human Y chromosome. Furthermore, it is becoming clear that the upper read length boundary is only delimited by the integrity of the DNA, suggesting the possibility that complete Y-chromosome assemblies, including full resolution of amplicons, might be possible in the near future. Notwithstanding, some challenges to obtain ultra-long reads from flow-sorted chromosomes are still to be overcome, as sorting sufficient material for this protocol is a substantial endeavor. It also is worth noting that our efforts to sequence the same input material on Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform have been fruitless, presumably due to interference of residual dyes with the sequencers optical detection system. Despite the technical challenges of flow-sorting single chromosomes, the method described here offers the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of long-range data together with local complexity reduction. Given different chromosomes that are sufficiently distinguishable in terms of size and GC content, immediate applications are either very complex chromosomes, such as the human Y, or extremely large genomes with a very high degree of common repeats, which have long challenged traditional WGS approaches, such as wheat, the loblolly pine, or the axolotl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chromosome preparation for flow karyotyping</title><p id="Par12">Mitotic chromosomes in suspension were prepared as follows (adapted from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> with some modifications): the lymphoblastoid cell line HG02982 (purchased from Coriell, cat. no.

To identify contigs belonging to the Y chromosome, we performed the following filtering steps: for contigs, which have local best placements on a chromosome different than the Y, we filtered out those whose proportion of mapped bases is higher on a sequence from the reference assembly different from the Y chromosome. Additionally, we filtered out any alignments with a mismap probability higher than 10e&#x02013;5.

We masked all common repeats as identified by RepeatMasker (see above) and tandem repeat finder. We created non-overlapping 36-mers of the raw reads, which were mapped onto the assembly using GEM (v 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> allowing for a divergence of up to 5%. The read depth was calculated in non-overlapping windows of 1&#x02009;kb of non-repetitive sequence. After correcting for GC content using mrCanavar (v. 0.51), we normalized by the mean read depth. To assign a copy number to each gene, we calculated the median copy number of all windows intersecting a gene. For the hg38 Y chromosome, a set of custom single-copy regions needed to be provided to the CN caller as calibration. These regions were inferred by subtracting the reference WGAC (whole-genome assembly comparison, UCSC track genomic superdups) segmental duplication track from the whole Y chromosome and keeping only stretches of single-copy sequence longer than 2&#x02009;kb.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Gene annotation</title><p id="Par55">The annotation of the HG02982 assembly was performed by trying to assign the genes present in the Y-chromosome annotation of GRCh38 gencode version 27. For this purpose, we downloaded the gff3, the transcript sequences and the protein sequences that corresponded to the Y-chromosome annotation and performed transcript and protein mappings with GMAP (v. 20170317<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>) and exonerate (v. 2.2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>), respectively. Additionally, a numeric index was assigned to each gene in the HG38 Y chromosome according to the order in the chromosome. Next, we combined all the data (transcript mappings, protein mappings and gene synteny) with an in-house script (available at 10.6084/m9.figshare.7359065.v1) to locate each gene in our assembly and assign parts of the assembly to their corresponding region in the Y chromosome of GRCh38. After following the strategy mentioned above for all the genes, we took a closer look to the protein-coding genes, by manually checking some of the mappings in order to determine possible errors in the sequence caused by the Nanopore reads that could introduce frameshifts or internal stop codons in the aminoacidic sequence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Illumina WGBS sequencing and methylation calls</title><p id="Par56">Two micrograms of genomic DNA from a lymphoblastoid cell line (HG02982) were spiked with unmethylated bacteriophage &#x003bb; DNA (5&#x02009;ng of &#x003bb; DNA per microgram of genomic DNA; Promega) and with methylated T7 phage DNA (5&#x02009;ng of T7 DNA per microgram of genomic DNA). The DNA was sheared to 50&#x02013;500&#x02009;bp in size using Covaris LE220 ultrasonicator, and fragments of 150&#x02013;300&#x02009;bp were size-selected using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt Bioscience). The libraries were constructed using the KAPA Library Preparation Kit with no PCR Library Amplification/Illumina series (Roche-Kapa Biosystems) together with the NEXTFLEX&#x000ae; Bisulfite-Seq Barcodes (Perkin Elmer). After adaptor ligation, the DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Enrichment for adaptor-ligated DNA was carried out through seven PCR cycles using KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ReadyMix PCR 2x Kit (Roche-Kapa Biosystems). Library quality was monitored using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 7500 assay, and the library concentration was estimated using quantitative PCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina&#x000ae; Platforms, v1.14 (Roche-Kapa Biosystems).</p><p id="Par57">Paired-end DNA sequencing (2&#x000d7;101&#x02009;bp) of the converted libraries was performed using the HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol with HiSeq Control Software (HCS) 2.2.68. Primary data analysis, image analysis, base calling, and quality scoring of the run, was processed using the manufacturer&#x02019;s software Real Time Analysis (RTA 1.18.66.3) and followed by generation of FASTQ sequence files by CASAVA.</p><p id="Par58">We used the gemBS pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> using the default parameters to perform the analysis. The reference genome used for the alignment was GRCh38.

The under and over conversion rates for the sample were &#x0003c;1 and ~&#x02009;5%, respectively. Only uniquely mapping reads were retained for downstream analysis. The comparison with the Nanopore calls was performed for all canonical CpG sites on the Y chromosome where there was sequencing data available from both experiments.
