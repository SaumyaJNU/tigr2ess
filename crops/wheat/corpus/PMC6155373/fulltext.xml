Despite increasing knowledge of neighbor detection and response involving plant volatiles, less is known about how soil-borne signaling chemicals may act belowground in plant&#x02013;plant interactions.

Wheat can detect both conspecific and heterospecific neighbors and responds by increasing allelochemical production. Furthermore, we show that (-)-loliolide and jasmonic acid are present in root exudates from a diverse range of species and are able to trigger allelochemical production in wheat.

Plant neighbor detection involves both physical and chemical signals, including far-red light reflection, alteration of nutrient availability and plant-released secondary metabolites. These signals trigger complex plant response strategies such as shade avoidance, root foraging, and chemical defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Much of the research into chemical-mediated neighbor detection and signaling interactions has dealt with volatiles induced by herbivory or other environmental stressors in initiating defensive responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This focus is primarily driven by the accessibility of aerial tissues and availability of reliable techniques to detect and identify volatile chemicals. Nevertheless, plant neighbor detection and signaling interactions take place both aboveground and belowground. Aboveground signaling interactions are well established and mediated by air-borne chemicals including methyl jasmonate, salicylate, benzoate, and indole, as well as ethylene and several volatile terpenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the identity of soil-borne chemicals involved in belowground signaling interactions is largely unknown.</p><p id="Par4">In contrast to aboveground signaling chemicals which move freely in air, the transduction of belowground chemicals requires root-soil interactions. A great deal of recent attention has been paid to belowground signaling interactions among plant species at the root level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In particular, root detection and placement patterns may be mediated through root-secreted chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These belowground signals are potentially conducted by physical contact of root hairs and tips or conveyed through associated mycorrhizal hyphae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, it is extremely difficult to unambiguously isolate chemical-mediated belowground signaling interactions due to the complexity of plant-soil interactions. Specifically, it has been difficult to identify root-secreted signaling chemicals and determine whether their delivery is dependent on root contact or common mycorrhizal networks.</p><p id="Par5">When neighboring plants are detected, focal plants may respond to neighbors in morphological and biochemical ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In particular, neighbors influence plant defensive biochemistry in a species-specific fashion, altering the production of defensive metabolites such as allelochemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Allelochemicals can have profound effects on the performance of neighboring plants, i.e., allelopathy, an interference mechanism in which neighbor plants are chemically suppressed through the release of allelochemicals from focal plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, allelopathy research has primarily focused only on focal plants and their allelochemicals rather than on the signaling interactions between plants that mediate the interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, allelopathic interference and neighbor detection usually are studied separately, despite their necessary linkage in nature.</p><p id="Par6">For two species that coexist, plants first may detect and potentially recognize their neighbors, and then initiate allelopathic interference to regulate inter-specific or intra-specific interactions. Neighbor detection and allelochemical response are two inseparable processes when one or more plants occur together and interact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This pattern may arise through the production and release of signaling chemicals that induce the production of defensive allelochemicals. Accordingly, the signaling chemicals may ideally be common to most potential competitors. Alternatively, allelochemical production may be constitutive, produced whether or not neighbors are present, potentially wasting valuable plant resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In previous studies we used production of the putative allelochemical DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), which has a charcterized metabolic profil in soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, by allelopathic wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) as a model system. We reported that production of DIMBOA was induced by a diverse range of neighboring plants in a density-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Root exudates from a range of species were able to induce DIMBOA production and the plant hormone jasmonate, and to a lesser extent salicylate, were able to induce DIMBOA production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Despite these findings, the identity of the soil-borne chemical signals that are responsible for neighbor detection and allelochemical response in belowground signaling interactions has not been exhaustively characterized and whether such soil-borne chemical signals are common to most plant species remains unknown.</p><p id="Par9">Here, we show that, using new data and data from previous studies we show that wheat can respond to at least 100 other plant species via belowground interactions. We show that (-)-loliolide and jasmonic acid, present in root exudates are sufficient to induce this response and suggesting that they can mediate this response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Neighbor-induced allelochemical responses</title><p id="Par10">Previously we reported a density dependent increase in DIMBOA concentration in wheat roots when co-cultivated with multiple weed species results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We investigated density-dependence of the DIMBOA response further by co-cultivating wheat with eight weed species (four of which were examined previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>). When wheat was paired with itself and eight common weeds (<italic>Eleusine indica, Digitaria sanguinalis, Abutilon theophrasti</italic>, <italic>Bidens frondosa, Lolium perenne, Avena fatua, Alopecurus japonicus</italic>, and <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic>) that often come into contact with wheat, allelochemical DIMBOA concentration varied with the density of the neighbors. Significantly increased concentrations of the allelochemical were observed at the 5:4&#x02013;5:9 (wheat: neighbor) proportions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It appeared that the presence of either conspecific or heterospecifc neighbors could induce the allelochemical response in a density-dependent manner. To provide a broader context for the neighbor-induced allelochemical response, we combined data from our previous publication where DIMBOA concentration was examined in wheat co-cultivated with 36 different wheat species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> with newly generated data for additional species. This produced a dataset of wheat biomass and wheat DIMBOA concentration in root and shoot following co-cultivation with a total of 100 different plant species at ratios of 5:8 and/or 5:5 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We found markedly increased induction of DIMBOA in heterospecific combinations, relative to DIMBOA production when competing with conspecifics, particularly in wheat roots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Significant increases in wheat DIMBOA production occurred in 38/100 species at a 5:5 proportion while 70/100 species at a 5:8 mixture (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This effect was much larger in wheat roots than in shoots, with an effect size in roots nearly three-fold larger than that of shoots. In sharp contrast to the neighbor-induced allelochemical response, the presence of heterospecific neighbors led to very little changes in wheat biomass of shoots and roots relative to controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Though statistically significant, increases in shoot biomass relative to those in conspecific controls were minimal. The timing of species interactions also had a significant impact on DIMBOA concentrations. Compared with the simultaneous planting of wheat and neighbors at a 5:5 proportion, the early presence of neighbors led to a greater increase of DIMBOA concentration, while the later colonization of neighbors did not induce an allelochemical response, being nearly identical to intraspecific controls (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Though significant intraspecific induction occurred in wheat, the responsiveness was by far the least sensitive, showing that neighbor-induced allelochemical responses are more related to the density and early exposure to heterospecific neighbors, than the identity of the competing neighbor species.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Variation in allelochemical DIMBOA concentration of wheat plants in response to eight commonly interacting weeds at different densities. <bold>a</bold>

The mechanisms underlying neighbor detection that generated the allelochemical response were investigated further by belowground segregation experiments using not only 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;m mesh, but also 0.45&#x02009;&#x003bc;m mesh and plastic film (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The presence of all four heterospecific neighbors (<italic>E. indica, D. sanguinalis, A. theophrasti</italic> and <italic>B. frondosa</italic>) increased DIMBOA concentration in all treatments other than those completely separated with plastic film (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The plastic film completely blocked belowground physical, chemical and biological interactions so that wheat and neighbor interactions were limited to aboveground. The lack of variation in the concentration of DIMBOA with complete exclusion indicated that there were not aerial signaling interactions. However, DIMBOA concentration was increased in the presence of all four neighbors even with segregation by fine nylon mesh, indicating belowground signaling interactions between wheat and neighbors. In particular, the 0.45&#x02009;&#x003bc;m mesh not only prevented penetration of roots but also blocked mycorrhizal linkages. Under this treatment, only belowground bacterial and chemical interactions occurred in the experimental pots. These results were verified in experiments with four other neighbors (<italic>L. perenne, A. fatua, A. japonicas</italic> and <italic>A. tauschii</italic>). Although these four neighbors did not significantly induce DIMBOA production at a 5:5 mixture, significant induction occurred at a 5:8 mixture, even under belowground segregation with the 0.45&#x02009;&#x003bc;m mesh (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These results suggest that neighbor-induced allelochemical response was mediated by root-secreted chemical signals or soil bacteria rather than by root contact and soil mycorrhizal hyphae.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Allelochemical response of wheat shoot and root to the presence of neighbors grown at a 5:5 mixture with various levels of belowground segregation. <bold>a</bold> Wheat shoot; <bold>b</bold> Wheat root.

We also previously showed that jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA) when supplied at higher concentration, were sufficient to induce the production of DIMBOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Here, we extended this analysis by re-analyzing those samples and adding four additional species. The root exudates from neighbor species were applied to the soil at varying concentrations. When wheat was exposed to the root exudates after 6&#x02009;h, the concentration of allelochemical DIMBOA varied with neighbor species identity in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Induction of DIMBOA was very limited in conspecific exudates when compared to all heterospecific exudates. The root exudates of <italic>A. theophrasti</italic> significantly increased the DIMBOA concentration at a low density of 50 plants 500&#x02009;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, followed by <italic>D. sanguinalis, E. indica</italic>, and <italic>B. frondosa. A. fatua</italic> and <italic>A. tauschii</italic> at a medium concentration of 100 plants 500&#x02009;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. All root exudates from either wheat itself or other species tested significantly induced the production of DIMBOA at the highest concentrations of 200 plants 500&#x02009;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Similar effects of the root exudates and the presence of neighbors in a density-dependent manner suggest widespread occurrence of signaling components in the root exudates across different plant species.</p><p id="Par13">To identify which individual root exudate components could elicit DIMBOA production,a bioassay-guided fractionation approach was used (see Methods). Four potential chemical signals jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), (-)-loliolide and luteolin were identified (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). These presence of these potential signals was tested in all 100 heterospecifc neighbors. JA, SA and (-)-loliolide were found in wheat as well as all 100 heterospecifc neighbors, whereas luteolin was less common (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These chemicals were also detected in the root exudates and rhizosphere soils of the subset of species tested (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). There was a significant positive correlation across species between neighbor-induced DIMBOA and their root-secreted (-)-loliolide concentrations (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.76, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), but such a significant correlation was not found for JA, SA or luteolin (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Further, soil incubation showed that JA, SA, (-)-loliolide and luteolin all elicited the production of DIMBOA in a dose-dependent manner. Significant effects were observed for (-)-loliolide at a low concentration of 5&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dry soil and for JA at a medium concentration of 50&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dry soil. However, SA and luteolin required a higher concentration of over 100&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> dry soil for elicitation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In particular, the mixture of (-)-loliolide and JA at a low concentration greatly induced allelochemical response but the joint action was not observed in the mixture of (-)-loliolide and SA or luteolin (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Furthermore, there were significant differences in mobility factor among the chemicals, with (-)-loliolide having the highest mobility in soil (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Compared with SA and luteolin, (-)-loliolide and JA were more effective signaling chemicals to trigger the allelochemical response. Therefore, we suggest that wheat likely detects the presence of neighbors through root-secreted (-)-loliolide and JA in the soil, which can then initiate the release and production of DIMBOA, resulting in an induction of allelopathy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Induced effect of four potential signaling chemicals at diferent doses on the production of DIMBOA in wheat roots.

Allelopathic wheat appears to be able to detect the presence of plant neighbors when they occur early in development, and respond by increasing allelochemicals regardless of their neighbor identity. Wheat produces and releases benzoxazolinone allelochemicals, including DIMBOA and its glycosides, at early growth stages. Because of this, the hydrolysis and metabolic profiling of allelochemical DIMBOA from plants to soils is well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In the current study, the increase in DIMBOA production was only two-fold or so. From a typical dose/response relationship, a two-fold increase in a toxin that is already present at a significant level may not be expected to have a substantial effect. However, a more dramatic effect might occur with joint action of other benzoxazolinone compounds of wheat.</p><p id="Par15">Although the neighbor-induced allelochemical responses were density-dependent, these responses occurred primarily at intermediate neighbor densities. Plants growing with a high density of neighbors likely experienced an increase in competition-induced stress. Competition can alter plant allocation strategies, resulting in a shift from defense to growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Allelopathic plant species often increase allelochemical concentrations in response to low or intermediate levels of competition, but a decrease of allelochemicals at higher levels of competition where resource limitation may prevent such allocation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the timing of plant exposure to competition may strongly mitigate allelochemical responsiveness. In the current study, induction of DIMBOA only occurred when wheat was exposed to competitors very early in development, with no response to later exposure. This suggests that there is a critical temporal window for detection of competition that also has large implications for species coexistence. In the crop-weed model system explored here, allelochemical induction early in development may aid the performance of plants exposed to competition. However, later germinating competitors will pose a much lower competitive risk because of their smaller size relative to the wheat, and therefore allocation to allelochemicals would be less beneficial to plant fitness. A similar strategy would be an advantageous response to competition in non-crop systems as well.</p><p id="Par16">Although any stress caused by neighboring plants as a result of resource depletion or alteration of microbial communities might also induce an allelochemical response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, direct neighbor-induced allelochemical responses are critical to plant-plant interactions. Plant neighbor detection usually is mediated by direct contact or chemical release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In belowground plant-plant signaling interactions, the detection of neighbors may occur through contact of root tips, soil microbes, especially common mycorrhizal networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, or root-secreted signaling chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, the mediators of belowground signaling interactions are still controversial due to inadequate methodology and our poor knowledge of the diversity of soil interactions. This study addressed the mechanism of belowground signaling through a series of experiments with and without root, mycorrhizal, and soil chemical segregation. This segregation-based approach clearly distinguished aboveground and belowground signaling interactions in generating allelochemical responses. Allelochemical production was induced by competitors with root segregation with both sizes of nylon mesh but not with complete segregation, where only aboveground signals would occur. Neighbor-induced allelochemical responses still occurred with the 0.45&#x02009;&#x003bc;m mesh that would have segregated soil mycorrhizal hyphae but still allowed bacterial and chemical contact. Furthermore, allelochemical production was experimentally induced by the root exudates of neighboring plants, isolating the effects of chemicals from soil bacteria. These results indicatethat allelopathic wheat can detect neighboring plants purely through root-secreted signaling chemicals rather than via root contact, common mycorrhizal networks, or soil bacteria.</p><p id="Par17">Plants may detect neighbors through plant volatiles as air-borne signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, while root exudates drive belowground plant&#x02013;plant signaling interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

However, information on other signaling chemicals involved in belowground plant&#x02013;plant signaling interactions has remained scarce. Root-secreted strigolactones were described as signaling chemicals between parasitic plants and their hosts several decades ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Strigolactones also act as chemical signals for fungal symbionts and parasitic weeds in plant roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, strigolactones do not appear to have a universal role in belowground plant-plant signaling interactions and there may be other, more specific, root-secreted signaling chemicals awaiting identification.</p><p id="Par18">JA and SA may play some roles in belowground chemical communications.

In this study, besides the commonly studied JA and SA, (-)-loliolide and luteolin contributed to neighbor-induced allelochemical responses. In particular, (-)-loliolide and JA strongly induced allelochemical production at very low concentrations, whereas luteolin and SA required greater concentrations. Although these concentrations were greater when compared with the quantities of (-)-loliolide and JA as determined in the root exudates and rhizosphere soils from interacting weeds tested, we propose that such bioactive phytochemicals provided over a long time period at low concentrations might be able to induce substantial effects. Additionally, soil extractions would have diluted the chemical signals over large soil volumes while the concentrations of (-)-loliolide and JA detected would be locally much higher in intact soils. Furthermore, there was a joint action in the mixture of (-)-loliolide and JA at low concentrations. Thus, even if the actual concentration of (-)-loliolide and JA in soil was still substantially lower than the necessary concentration to elicit wheat allelochemical production, an effect would still be expected.</p><p id="Par19">Similar to SA, phenolic luteolin is a signal in the resistance response of plant to microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

More importantly, (-)-loliolide was detected in all of the 101 plant species tested while luteolin only occurred in 79 plant species. Actually, (-)-loliolide is the most ubiquitous lactone that occurs in many plant families and marine alga<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In the current study, (-)-loliolide was found in every monocot and dicot plant species tested and could be secreted from roots into rhizosphere soils. (-)-loliolide had a higher soil mobility and could easily be moved from the rhizosphere to bulk soil. Therefore, (-)-loliolide may be a ubiquitous, soil-borne signaling chemical that can trigger plant defensive responses in belowground plant&#x02013;plant interactions.</p><p id="Par20">Growth-inhibiting allelochemicals and signaling chemicals involved in plant&#x02013;plant interactions profoundly affect the performance of plants, altering the consequences of intra-specific and inter-specific interactions in ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It is now clear that plant-derived signaling chemicals contribute to plant neighbor detection and defensive responses.

However, (-)-loliolide and JA found in this study are ubiquitous signaling chemicals among plants, and are produced by the focal allelopathic wheat as well.

We speculate that variation in level of soil signaling chemicals produced across species has the potential to lead to variable responses in natural systems, though these chemical signals could still be general indicators of competition. We assume that there is an additional, species-specific signaling chemical that inhibits the induction of allelochemicals in conspecific interactions. This could be a much less common soil chemical, one more representative of the species identity and also much less likely to be detected by our methods which focused on chemicals that generated an allelochemical response. Fractionation-guided bioassays that focus on the inhibition of (-)-loliolide responses would be necessary to identify this soil signal.</p><p id="Par22">The importance of belowground signaling interactions to plant neighbor detection and response strategies, as well as the mechanisms underlying such communications, has been a major focus of the science of plant interaction in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

Although a generic response to (-)-loliolide was detected here, there are likely to be additional signaling mechanisms that could allow species-specific responses.

Elution was performed with a mixture of 0.5% acetic acid and MeOH (70:30, v/v) at a constant flow rate of 1.0&#x02009;ml&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The peak of DIMBOA was identified by its retention time (9.8&#x02009;min) and coelution with an authentic standard (Regenstauf, Germany). DIMBOA was quantified by regression analysis of the peak areas against standard concentrations (limit of quantification, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; recovery rates at concentrations of 200&#x02013;1500&#x02009;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 66.5&#x02013;82.4%).</p><p id="Par36">Four potential signaling chemicals JA, SA, (-)-loliolide and luteolin were quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The plant tissues, root exudates or rhizosphere soils were each freeze-dried and ground with liquid nitrogen. An amount of 250&#x02009;mg of the resulting powder was extracted with 10&#x02009;ml of MeCN (acetonitrile)-H<sub>2</sub>O-HOAC mixture (90:9:1, v/v/v), vortexed for 5&#x02009;min at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and then NaCl was added and immediately vortexed vigorously for 1&#x02009;min. After the solution was centrifuged at 2800&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x02009;min, the supernatant was filtered with a 0.22&#x02009;&#x003bc;m nylon syringe filter (Sterlitech, Kent, WA, USA). Analyses of four chemicals were carried out on a triple&#x02013;quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQD, Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in positive mode for (-)-loliolide and luteolin and negative mode for JA and SA. Instrument control and data acquisition were performed using MassLynx software (version 4.1). Chromatographic separation was performed using an Acquity UPLC-BEH C<sub>18</sub> column (50&#x02009;mm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.1&#x02009;mm, 1.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The injection volume was 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;l. The elution gradient was carried out with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.2% HOAC in H<sub>2</sub>O (solvent A) and MeCN (solvent B) at a constant flow rate of 0.3&#x02009;ml&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Simultaneous separations were completed using a gradient elution of 0.0&#x02009;min/90% A, 2&#x02009;min/10% A, 3.0&#x02009;min/10% A, 4&#x02009;min/90% A, and 5.0&#x02009;min/90% A. Separation and stabilization were achieved in 5.0&#x02009;min. The typical conditions were capillary voltage, 3.0&#x02009;kV; source temperature, 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; and desolvation temperature, 350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The cone and desolvation gas were set at flow rates of 50 and 600&#x02009;l&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. Multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was operated for each chemical. All parameters for the MRM transitions, cone voltage and collision energy were optimized to obtain the highest sensitivity and resolution.

Quantification of four chemicals was each conducted by the addition method with authentic standards. Limit of detection (LOD) for the chemicals is the concentration that produces <italic>S</italic>/<italic>N</italic> (signal-to-noise ratio)&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, estimated from the chromatogram corresponding to the lowest concentration used in the calibration, whereas limit of quantification (LOQ) is defined based on S/N&#x02009;=&#x02009;10. The LOD were estimated at 0.006&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for loliolide, 0.004&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for luteolin, 0.004&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for JA and 0.006&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for SA. The LOQ were estimated at 0.02&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for loliolide, 0.01&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for luteolin, 0.01&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for JA and 0.02&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for SA. The recoveries of the four chemicals ranged in 86.2&#x02013;102.6% (RSD, 4.56&#x02013;10.88) at the spike level of 0.01&#x02013;150 nmol g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par37">For the survey of 100 species, data were presented as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard error (SE) from each of independent experiments with three replicates. The data were analyzed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Tukey post-hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons when ANOVA terms were significant using SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Regression lines were fitted as linear or quadratic model results using Sigmaplot 10.0 (Systat Software Inc. San Jose, California, USA). A simple Pearson&#x02019;s correlation was used to test whether the allelochemical DIMBOA induction across samples correlated with signaling components of the root exudates also using SPSS. While we did not control for multiple comparisons in the response survey of 100 species, we calculated binomial probabilities for obtaining the number of significant individual tests. To provide a single overview of this survey, we calculated Ln-transformed response ratios relative to the wheat:wheat treatment in each species for both the DIMBOA concentration and biomass of roots and shoots. From these 100 ratios, we present means &#x000b1;95% confidence intervals as a measure of effect size.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
