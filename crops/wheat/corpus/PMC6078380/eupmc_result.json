    "The advanced biochemical characterisation of green, red lentil and wheat flours was performed by assessing their folic acid content as well as individual minerals, amino acids, fatty acids and volatile compounds. Moreover, a nutritionally improved wheat-lentil composite flour, with a content of 133.33 μg of folic acid/100 g, was proposed in order to assure the folic acid daily intake (200 μg) for an adult person. The wheat and lentil flours percentages used for the composite were calculated by using the equations for total material balance and folic acid content material balance. Bread was selected as model food for the composite flour due to its high daily intake (~ 250 g day-1) and to its great potential in biofortification. By this algorithm, two composite flours were developed, wheat-green lentil flour (22.21-77.79%) and wheat-red lentil flour (42.62-57.38%), their advanced biochemical characteristics being predicted based on the determined compositions of their constituents. The baking behaviour of the new developed wheat-lentils composite flours with optimised folic acid content was tested. In order to objectively compare the bread samples, texture profile analysis was considered the most relevant test. A good baking behaviour was observed for the wheat-red lentil bread, while for the wheat-green lentil composite flour, encouraging results were obtained."
