We firstly examined 4&#x02009;day old seedlings of five wheat genotypes in response to anoxia at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C by assessing growth rate, tissue damage and changes in metabolite abundances. Significant genotypic variations in anoxia tolerance were observed, especially at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Wheat seedlings grown at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C appeared to be more anoxia tolerant and showed less genotypic variation than those at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. To minimize seedling size variations and define the temperature effects, we grew two contrasting genotypes at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3.5 d and adapted to 4 different temperatures for 0.5 d before exposing them to anoxia at each adapted temperature. Genotypic variation in abundance of anoxia induced metabolites occurred at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C but not at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Tissue- and temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations to anoxia were revealed. In roots, the ability to maintain sugar/sugar-phosphate and TCA cycle metabolite levels and the accumulation of amino acids when temperature was below 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C correlated with anoxia tolerance. Temperatures between 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02013;24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C are critical for metabolic adaptation and suggest that further assessment of waterlogging/flooding tolerance of wheat seedlings should consider the temperature-dependence of tolerance in evaluations.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Flooding, waterlogging, or high soil microbial activity cause oxygen deprivation in plants. Worldwide, floods affect 17 million km<sup>2</sup> of arable land<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Flooding is expected to increase in frequency as a consequence of climate change and lead to yield loss for many crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The two major crops, rice and wheat, differ markedly in their anoxia tolerance. Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) is highly tolerant to anoxia and is able to survive partly by increasing the abundance of enzymes involved in anaerobic ATP production, namely glycolysis and ethanolic fermentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Rice also maintains growth, even under anoxic conditions, for a sustained period of time. This tolerance in rice is underpinned by extensive alteration of primary metabolism and is also linked to tissue type as the coleoptile grows and extends under anoxia while roots stop elongation under anoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is relatively anoxia intolerant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and fails to rapidly adjust cytoplasmic pH and enzyme abundances in order to respond to an anaerobic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, the increased rate of glycolysis for energy production under low oxygen is small in wheat, suggesting regulation of energy metabolism is at least partially to blame for the intolerance of wheat to O<sub>2</sub> deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Given wheat&#x02019;s limited ability to withstand anoxia, the assessment of anoxia or waterlogging tolerance is distinct from studies of anoxia in tolerant species and is challenged by the lack of consistent performance of so-called tolerant varieties across variations in environmental factors such as temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, field trials conducted in Mexico showed the high tolerance of the wheat variety Ducula to waterlogging; whereas trials conducted in Australia and India showed many other wheat genotypes outperforming Ducula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This performance difference was suggested to be caused by different environmental conditions including temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In another study, wheat seedlings of eleven genotypes were assessed at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for responses to anoxia and showed differences in seminal root elongation and root tissue K<sup>+</sup> concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here, Ducula appeared to be relatively more anoxia tolerant than other wheat varieties at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In barley, varieties of Kustaa, Hankkija-673, and Pokko differed in their tolerance to anoxia and flooding at 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C but not at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, where all varieties displayed reduced survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Improvement of waterlogging tolerance of wheat seedlings under low temperatures has been shown to be partially due to a small relative growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. More detailed analysis showed that wheat roots lose elongation potential at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C after only 10&#x02009;h of anoxia, compared to seedlings at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, where after 20&#x02009;h anoxia 20&#x02013;70% of the elongation potential remained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It was suggested that the potential difference in ethanolic fermentation and metabolic adaption may cause this differential anoxia tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To date, there is no detailed information on metabolic adaption of wheat seedlings in response to anoxia at the different temperatures to explain these observations.</p><p id="Par4">Plants undergo considerable metabolic changes in response to anoxia. Alanine accumulation is common in most plant species under anaerobic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and is thought to benefit pH balance within anoxic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. There are several metabolic pathways responsible for the accumulation of alanine upon anoxia. Induction of alanine amino transferase (AlaAT) activity and genes encoding AlaAT under flooding have previously been reported to contribute to alanine accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, alanine accumulation was also observed in <italic>AlaAT</italic> knockout lines lacking AlaAT activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Alternatively, alanine can be produced by gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) using pyruvate as co-substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It has also been suggested that alanine and succinate accumulation during anoxia improves ATP production during anoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Previously, we found that alanine failed to accumulate during anoxia in wheat coleoptiles, which was in dramatic contrast to anoxia tolerant rice coleoptiles at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and to other plant tissues as noted above. To further understand whether this alanine response was genotype-, tissue- or temperature-dependent, we firstly selected 5 wheat genotypes and 2 temperatures (15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) to measure growth, damage and metabolic response in root and coleoptile tissues. To minimize seedling size variations and define the temperature effects, we then selected two contrasting genotypes grown at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3.5 d and transferred them to 4 different temperatures (15, 20, 24, 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) for 0.5 d and then exposed them to anoxia for 1 d. Genotype-, tissue- and temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations to anoxia were revealed. We provided evidence that changes of temperature between 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02013;24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C are critical for metabolic adaptation of wheat seedlings, especially root tissue, to anoxia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Growth under anoxia and recovery</title><p id="Par6">To understand the impact of anoxia and temperature on wheat growth, we selected 5 genotypes (Calingiri, Carnamah, Spear, SARC, Ducula) and grew them at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C continuously. We measured length of coleoptiles, leaves, primary roots and seminal roots in aerated seedlings as well as seedlings subjected to one day of anoxia followed by three days of re-oxygenation. The absolute growth data indicating tissue lengths at different time points are given in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> with statistical analyses shown in Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>.

We also measured leaf elongation at a developmental stage where leaves were beginning to emerge from the coleoptiles. The anoxia treatment had less of an impact on the recovery of leaves, as indicated by the fact that proportional growth measurements after 3 days of re-oxygenation are not significantly different between anoxia treated and aerated controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>), with the exception of Calingiri leaves at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C which displayed a quicker growth after anoxia.</p><p id="Par9">Overall, the coleoptile was the most anoxia tolerant tissue across all cultivars with Calingiri displaying the greatest response.

In roots, amino acids, particularly GABA and alanine, accumulated at a much higher level at lower temperature (15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) than that at higher temperature (24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Addition of exogenous amino acids also improved anoxia tolerance of wheat seedlings as indicated by less ion leakage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Accumulation of GABA and alanine in plants in response to low oxygen or anoxia has been commonly observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The importance of accumulation of alanine and GABA in roots and coleoptiles in all genotypes at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C suggested either the operation of the GABA shunt pathway during anoxia or the blocking of the shunt leading to accumulation of GABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Depletion of glutamic acid, glutamine, pyroglutamic acid and aspartic acid can be explained by the transfer of amines to other amino acids such as alanine and GABA. Anoxia treatment dramatically induced AlaAT activity at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C reaching to the similar level as those at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7F</xref>). In anaerobic roots of barley grown at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the activity of alanine aminotransferase was induced over days under low oxygen stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Transamination of GABA with pyruvate produces alanine and succinic semialdehyde, which then generates succinate. When oxygen returns, alanine can be converted back to pyruvate, for eventual assimilation into aerobic metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">We previously observed depletion of TCA cycle metabolites, with the exception of succinate, in coleoptiles of both rice and wheat seedlings after 1 d anoxia treatment at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this study, depletions of TCA cycle metabolites in coleoptiles, with the exception of succinate, were also observed across different temperatures and varied with genotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The depletion of TCA cycle metabolites was presumably due to the cessation of TCA cycle operation without the respiratory electron acceptor O<sub>2</sub>. The positive correlation between accumulation of succinate in coleoptiles and the increase of temperature (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80; Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) indicated the temperature-dependent anoxic-induced succinate accumulation in wheat coleoptiles. It is well-known that rice shoots or coleoptiles accumulated succinate in response to anoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast to coleoptiles, TCA metabolites in roots were depleted at the two high temperatures, but remained relatively stable or only decreased moderately at two low temperatures (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Interestingly, succinate in roots was maintained at a stable level across different temperature treatments (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The mechanism causing these differences in metabolite abundance between coleoptiles and roots in response to anoxia awaits for further investigation.</p><p id="Par32">Increase in temperature from 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C stimulated root growth of Calingiri but not Ducula, and there was no growth response for coleoptiles of either genotype (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). For both genotypes, however, this 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C temperature difference (20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) caused dramatic changes in metabolic adaptation of wheat roots to anoxia (Figs <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Combinations of conservation of sugar/sugar-phosphate and TCA metabolites with accumulation of amino acids in roots when temperature was below 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) appeared to benefit anoxia tolerance. For example, at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, wheat roots lost elongation potential after only 10&#x02009;h anoxia, but at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C they maintained 20&#x02013;70% of elongation potential even after 20&#x02009;h anoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. During waterlogging and flooding in wheat fields, roots are the primary plant organs which suffer low oxygen or anoxia stresses. Therefore, temperature effects should be considered for the assessment of wheat waterlogging/flooding tolerance differences between genotypes.</p><p id="Par33">In conclusion, we assessed 4 days old seedlings of five wheat cultivars and revealed that wheat seedlings grown at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C were more anoxia tolerant than those at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Calingiri and Carnamah outperformed SARC and Ducula for anoxia tolerance, especially at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. By adding two more temperature treatments, variations in anoxic induced metabolite changes in response to anoxia between Calingiri and Ducula could be pinpointed to occur at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C but not at 15&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Tissue-dependent and temperature-dependent metabolic adaptations to wheat anoxia were thus revealed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Conservations of sugar/sugar-phosphate, TCA metabolites and accumulation of amino acids in roots when temperature is below 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C contributed to the improved anoxia tolerance. We provided evidence that a temperature shift between 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C is thus critical for induced metabolic adaptation of wheat seedlings to anoxia, especially in root tissues. Consideration of temperature effects is therefore suggested for designing the assessment of wheat waterlogging/flooding tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant Material</title><p id="Par34">Ducula, SARC, Spear, Carnamah have been previously tested in response to anoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.
