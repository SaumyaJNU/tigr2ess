While Thbs4 is known to protect striated muscle from disease by enhancing sarcolemmal stability through increased integrin and dystroglycan attachment complexes, here we show that Thbs3 antithetically promotes sarcolemmal destabilization by reducing integrin function, augmenting disease-induced decompensation. Deletion of Thbs3 in mice enhances integrin membrane expression and membrane stability, protecting the heart from disease stimuli. Transgene-mediated overexpression of &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1D integrin in the heart ameliorates the disease predisposing effects of Thbs3 by augmenting sarcolemmal stability. Mechanistically, we show that mutating Thbs3 to contain the conserved RGD integrin binding domain normally found in Thbs4 and Thbs5 now rescues the defective expression of integrins on the sarcolemma. Thus, Thbs proteins mediate the intracellular processing of integrin plasma membrane attachment complexes to regulate the dynamics of cellular remodeling and membrane stability.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Thrombospondin 4 has been shown to protect the heart and the skeletal muscle by enhancing matrix secretion and membrane stability thanks to its intracellular function.

In all experiments these double transgenic mice (DTG) were compared with animals only expressing the tetracycline transactivator (tTA). Thbs3 DTG hearts showed expression of Thbs3 and induction of the nuclear form of ATF6&#x003b1;, as well as multiple ER chaperones and transcriptional targets of ATF6&#x003b1; such as Armet, BiP and CRT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). ER chaperones were upregulated to similar levels in hearts from Thbs3 DTG and Thbs4 DTG mice (See below, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>), consistent with our previous description of Thbs4 heart-specific and skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Thbs3 enhances secretion of certain ECM proteins while at the same time it reduces sarcolemmal integrin levels. The combination of enhanced ECM secretion and reduced integrin binding of the embedded cells might assist in aspects of cellular remodeling with tissue injury or wound healing as cells reposition themselves in the scar or hypertrophic ventricle. Indeed, integrin shedding was proposed as a mechanism to allow transient remodeling of the cardiomyocyte-ECM connection during hypertrophic remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Thus, upregulation of Thbs3 would allow cardiomyocytes to remodel their interaction with the extracellular environment for a period of time, which likely becomes pathologic if chronically employed due to continued sarcolemmal instability associated with the de-attachment process (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">The direct interaction between Thbs proteins and a wide variety of integrins has been well established in the literature, perhaps more so than for any other Thbs interacting protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Application of exogenous recombinant Thbs3 or Thbs4 had no effect on integrin membrane trafficking or residence, yet recombinant Thbs4 and Thbs3 showed strong protein chaperone activity in vitro. Indeed, Thbs proteins may conduct many of their known biologic effects from within the vesicular trafficking network through their chaperone activity, including controlling ECM composition and membrane surface protein placement. Such an interpretation is also consistent with carefully conducted in vivo imaging studies that consistently fail to show Thbs proteins within the ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

Mutating the Thbs3 EGD domain to RGD now reverses the negative regulatory effect of Thbs3 on integrins, allowing proper membrane trafficking with reduced turnover through CRT and CNX.
