    "Winter common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants were cultivated on petroleum products contaminated soils with and without using biopreparation ZB-01. We determined the impact of soil contamination with petrol, diesel fuel and engine oil on selected antioxidant enzymes and the levels of antioxidants in the leaves of winter wheat. The impact of petroleum products on selected morphological characteristics of the plants, levels of nutrients and heavy metals was also assessed. Winter wheat was relatively resistant to soil contamination with petroleum products, and did not show a significant impact on the morphological characteristics of the plants. The levels of nutrients and heavy metals in the plants depended on the type of pollutant and the analyzed component.‬ Biopreparation ZB-01 generally resulted in an increase in calcium levels in the plants.‬ The winter wheat plants growing in soil contaminated with engine oil were characterized by higher levels of zinc, lead, manganese and cadmium than the control plants.‬ Biopreparation applied to the soil contaminated with petrol resulted in a slight increase in the levels of lead and zinc in the plants.‬ The petroleum products affected the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of antioxidants in the plants.‬ The general markers of soil contaminated with diesel fuel and petrol were POD activity and proline levels. Use of the ZB-01 biopreparation caused an increase in the levels of proline and -SH groups and an increase in the levels of carbon and calcium in the plants and had no effect on the morphological characteristics of plants.‬."
