Previous studies have suggested that NO regulates excitation-energy distribution of photosynthesis under WD stress. Here, quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted using iTRAQ. Differentially phosphorylated protein species (DEPs) were identified in leaves of NO- or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-treated wheat seedlings (D), and in control seedlings. From 1396 unique phosphoproteins, 2257 unique phosphorylated peptides and 2416 phosphorylation sites were identified. Of these, 96 DEPs displayed significant changes (&#x02265;1.50-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). These DEPs are involved in photosynthesis, signal transduction, etc. Furthermore, phosphorylation of several DEPs was upregulated by both D and NO treatments, but downregulated only in NO treatment. These differences affected the chlorophyll A&#x02013;B binding protein, chloroplast post-illumination chlorophyll-fluorescence-increase protein, and SNT7, implying that NO indirectly regulated the absorption and transport of light energy in photosynthesis in response to WD stress. The significant difference of chlorophyll (Chl) content, Chl a fluorescence-transient, photosynthesis index, and trapping and transport of light energy further indicated that exogenous NO under D stress enhanced the primary photosynthesis reaction compared to D treatment.

Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous signaling molecule that has attracted significant interest. As a bioactive molecule, NO is involved in numerous physiological processes in animals, and has also been reported as a mediator of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants [<xref rid="B1-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, various enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways for its synthesis have been reported [<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Important advancements have been achieved to elucidate the roles of NO in plant growth and development. The role of NO as a signal molecule has been established as an activator of reactive oxygen species (ROS), scavenging enzymes under abiotic stress [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, NO can be rapidly induced by environmental stimuli, and also acts as a secondary messenger during environmental stress-related signal transduction [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Exogenous NO, supplied to plants via sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or potassium nitrite, can also improve plant tolerance for environmental stress.</p><p>Water deficiency (WD) is an environmental factor that significantly impairs both crop growth and productivity [<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent trends in climate change have increased the frequency and severity of WD stress, indicating it as one of the main environmental issues of global concern [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plants grown under WD conditions have evolved various mechanisms to resist WD stress. One vital adaptation is the regulation of photosynthesis as a countermeasure to oxidative stress arising in WD conditions. Some of these adaptations involve NO [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the complex effect of NO on plants requires a detailed analysis of both physiological and molecular changes. The adaptability of plants to WD at the cellular and physiological levels is implemented by either induction or repression of relevant genes. Recently, a large number of analyses of plant responses to NO have been conducted using different techniques: transcriptional analyses identified 510 NO-related genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; comparative proteomics identified 92 NO-related proteins in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, indicating that exogenous NO alleviated Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; and 166 proteins were identified in <italic>Anemone vitifolia Buch</italic> using label-free quantitative proteomics after NO treatment without stress [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The above-identified NO-related genes or proteins were mostly involved in photosynthesis, stress, signaling, and secondary metabolism. NO has also been reported to be either directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of translation, and in post-translational modifications (PTMs). An established example is phosphorylation, which is one of the most prevalent and functionally important PTMs [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phosphorylation is also a frequent post-translational modification because thousands of kinase genes occupy 3%&#x02013;4% of functional genes in plants. Phosphorylation has therefore been widely employed to investigate the molecular mechanism of biotic/abiotic stress and the resulting hormone response.</p><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most-produced cereal crops. Although previous studies indicated that NO can alleviate WD stress, no systematic profiling studies by &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; have to date been published that dissect the effect of NO on wheat plants in response to WD stress. Here, comparative phosphoproteomics were performed to analyze the phosphorylation dynamics in response to exogenous NO donors (SNP) and 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000-induced WD (D) in wheat seedlings. Based on most protein species and in combination with the physiological level, NO-induced WD resistance was further verified, and a possible mechanism was suggested.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-19-02819"><title>2.

A fold-change value &#x0003e;1 indicates that the examined phosphorylated peptide is more abundant (suggesting its upregulation), while a fold-change value &#x0003c;1 indicates a less abundant phosphorylated peptide (suggesting its downregulation). A total of 96 differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPs) were identified in D/C consisting of 37 increased and 61 decreased proteins; (S + D)/C had less DEPs than D/C, including four less-increased and four less-decreased proteins (<xref rid="ijms-19-02819-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, only 25 and 24 DEPs were found in S/C and (S + D)/D. In total, the four groups had 148 DEPs with 172 differentially expressed phosphorylated peptides (DEPPs) (&#x0003e;1.5-fold change and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02819-f003">Figure 3</xref>).

Gene ontology (GO) analysis of DEPs indicated that most DEPs could be classified into 17 different biological processes. Fewer DEPs were found to have molecular function than those associated with cellular component and biological processes, and most DEPs were involved in binding. In biological processes, most DEPs were related to cellular processes, single-organism processes, biological regulation, metabolic processes, and response to stimulus (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02819">Figure S2</xref>). D/C or (S + D)/C exhibited two-fold increased DEPs compared to S/C or (S + D)/D, respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02819">Figure S3</xref>).

No change in S/C was detected. Not surprisingly, most of the DEPs were downregulated when wheat seedlings suffered from D (D/C).

Discussion</title><p>In abiotic stress studies, morphological, comparative physiological, and phosphoproteomic analyses are the most prevalent and effective strategies to investigate the mechanisms of abiotic stress resistance [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results of the present study suggest that morphological and RWC changes after exogenous NO pretreatment contribute to D resistance. Furthermore, a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis among NO or D treatments was successfully performed. The results indicate that the phosphorylated peptides participated in key biological processes, which might work cooperatively to establish a new cellular homeostasis in response to NO.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijms-19-02819"><title>3.1. Phosphoprotomics Elucidates Molecular Mechanism of NO-Induced D Tolerance in Wheat Seedlings</title><p>A number of studies indicated that phosphorylation played an important role in drought and chilling tolerance [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, 148 significant DEPs were identified in response to D or NO treatments. D was the single largest contributor to the variation among all four phosphoproteomic datasets obtained via PCA, followed by NO. This indicates that D treatment potentially impacts the phosphorylation of these proteins more significantly than NO treatment.</p><p>To date, quantitative phosphoproteomic studies in plants have shown that a majority of phosphoproteins only had one or two phosphorylation sites. Here, similar findings were obtained for wheat, and 76.9% of the phosphoproteins in four groups were found to possess fewer than two phosphorylation sites. However, only few DEPs were shown to have multiple phosphorylation sites. The distribution of phosphorylation Ser was maximal (87.3%) compared to the distributions of Thr and Lys, suggesting that these are preferentially highly sensitive and specific for Ser sites under D and NO treatment, followed by Thr and Lys residues. Identification of these phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites provides a basis for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying NO-regulated D resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-ijms-19-02819"><title>3.2. Comparison between Present Phosphoproteomic Data and Previous Studies</title><p>Only one NO-induced phosphoproteomic profile has been reported in cotton plants [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; furthermore, no study on NO with a D stress-related phosphoproteomic profile has been published for higher plants. Two studies reported the D-induced phosphoproteomic profile in wheat [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, one of these studies sampled wheat grains. Consequently, the results reported in these three References [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were compared to the findings of this study. Thirty-four of the NO-induced phosphoprotein species found here were identical to those found by Fan et al. [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; furthermore, nine and seven D&#x02013;induced phosphoprotein species identical to those found here were identified in the remaining two studies [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], respectively. Differences and commonalities are listed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02819">Table S5</xref>, most of which are related to photosynthesis metabolism and signaling; however, differential mechanisms could well be induced by NO with or without D stress in cotton or wheat. This difference is caused by different WD durations and extent, as well as wheat variety and sampling organization. The data reported herein aid the exploration of the molecular mechanism of NO-induced phosphorylation in response to severe D exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-ijms-19-02819"><title>3.3. Phosphorylation is Involved in the Photosynthesis Metabolism against D</title><p>Previous studies indicated that NO enhanced the stress resistance in other crops by regulating genes related to photosynthesis, metabolism, and stress signals [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, most of the phosphoproteins also participated in the photosynthesis metabolism, most of which in turn were downregulated after D treatment (<xref rid="ijms-19-02819-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02819">Figure S4</xref>). However, others were upregulated after NO plus D treatment, suggesting that the phosphorylation of these upregulated proteins was regulated by the interaction between NO and D; NO without D stress did not activate protein phosphorylation, which has also been reported before [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting that the effect of NO treatment is indirect.</p><p>Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (CAB) located in light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) can switch between light-harvesting antenna systems for photosystem (PS)I or PSII to maintain optimal excitation balance. This switch (termed state transition), involves the phosphorylation of CAB by specific thylakoid-bound Ser/Thr kinases (Stt7, SNT7, and TAKs) [<xref rid="B22-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Polverari et al. [<xref rid="B23-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that NO modulated the CAB gene, SNT7 is required for the plastoquinone (PQ) redox state and provides a link between short- and long-term photosynthetic acclimation [<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The novel nucleus-encoded chloroplast protein PIFI indicates the nonphotochemical reduction of PQ and has been reported to be involved in the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex-mediated chlororespiratory electron transport [<xref rid="B25-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Here, the phosphorylation level at Ser or Thr sites showed significant decreases due to D stress, and no significant difference was found in response to NO exposure. However, phosphorylation of several peptides was significantly activated by the interaction of NO and D, indicating that, if these peptides are phosphorylated, they play an important role in the adaptation to D stress, which may be linked to the induction of NO.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-ijms-19-02819"><title>3.4. NO-Enhanced D Tolerance Correlated with Primary Reaction of Photosynthesis</title><p>The central processes of photosynthesis are the absorption of light energy, electron transfer, and conversion of energy. Chl is an important pigment for photosynthesis and includes Chl a and Chl b. Chl a plays an important role as primary electron donor in the electron-transport chain and transfers resonance energy to the antenna complex, ending at the reaction center. Chl b aids the photosynthesis by absorbing light energy [<xref rid="B26-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Chl a and Chl b concentrations influence the ability to absorb light energy. Numerous previous studies indicated that NO increased biomass accumulation and photosynthetic-performance driving force (PI<sub>ABS</sub>) due to both the trapping of excitation energy (RC/ABS) and electron transport (P<sub>ET</sub>) [<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-02819" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Here, changes of Chl a and Chl b content, Chl fluorescence intensity, PIABS, RC/ABS, and PET in response to NO and D treatment showed that absorption, transfer, and conversion of light energy were regulated by NO under D stress.

The specific putative mechanism in wheat seedlings is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02819-f006">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>In this study, in response to D stress, the ROS that was generated via oxidative burst (intersystem electron transport (PET) from chloroplast and respiratory chain (RET) of mitochondria) is suggested to trigger NO synthesis. Under D stress, NO activates the phosphorylation of photosynthesis, signaling, and stress defense-related peptides, thus promoting stress tolerance. Additionally, when seedlings suffered from D stimuli, PSII momentarily ran faster than PSI; thus, this led to the uneven excitation of both the PS-generated redox and ROS signals that are then transmitted as retrograde signals to the cytosol, mitochondrion, and nucleus. During PET, including the PQ pool, the LHCII kinase SNT7 activates the phosphorylated LHCII. For example, the CAB protein moved from PSII to PSI, compensates the imbalance, and upregulates the PIFI phosphorylation level. This improved absorption, transfer, and conversion of light energy.

Conclusions</title><p>In this study, 20% PEG greatly inhibited both growth and leaf RWC of wheat seedlings; however, NO could alleviate this PEG-induced inhibition. Phosphorylation has been widely employed to understand the molecular mechanism of biotic/abiotic stress and hormone responses. Here, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed using iTRAQ in seedlings treated with S, D, and S + D compared with control. In total, 2257 unique phosphopeptides, 1396 unique phosphoproteins, and 2416 phosphorylation sites were identified among four experimental groups. In total, the four groups contained 148 DEPs with 172 different expressed DEPPs (&#x0003e;1.5-fold change and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02819-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Most species were involved in both photosynthetic metabolism and signaling. Most DEPPs decreased in response to D stress. However, several were increased after NO plus D treatment, such as part of the peptides of CAB, PIFI, and SNT7, which may be closely related to the absorption of light energy in the LHCII antenna and electron transport, as a primary reaction of photosynthesis. We suggest that the NO signal could play an important role in the phosphorylation of these peptides. The corresponding physiological change further confirmed the effect of NO on the primary reaction of photosynthesis in wheat seedlings suffering from D stress. This study provides insight into how the molecular mechanisms of NO improving D resistance in higher plants.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-19-02819"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/9/2819/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/9/2819/s1</uri>. </p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-19-02819-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-19-02819-s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>R.S. and G.K. conceived the study, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript; H.Z., S.J., and Y.J. performed most of the experiments and consulted references; Q.Y. provided the financial support.
