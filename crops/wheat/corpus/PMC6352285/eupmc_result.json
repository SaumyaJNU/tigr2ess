    "β-Glucan and black tea are fermented by the colonic microbiota producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and phenolic acids (PA). We hypothesized that the addition of β-glucan, a dietary fiber, and tea polyphenols to a food matrix like bread will also affect starch digestion in the upper gut and thus further influence colonic fermentation and SCFA production. This study investigated SCFA and PA production from locally developed breads: white bread (WB), black tea bread (BT), β-glucan bread (βG), β-glucan plus black tea bread (βGBT). Each bread was incubated in an in vitro system mimicking human digestion and colonic fermentation. Digestion with α-amylase significantly (p = 0.0001) increased total polyphenol and polyphenolic metabolites from BT bread compared with WB, βG, and βGBT. Total polyphenols in βGBT remained higher (p = 0.016; 1.3-fold) after digestion with pepsin and pancreatin compared with WB. Fermentations containing βG and βGBT produced similar propionate concentrations ranging from 17.5 to 18.6 mmol/L and total SCFA from 46.0 to 48.9 mmol/L compared with control WB (14.0 and 37.4 mmol/L, respectively). This study suggests that combination of black tea with β-glucan in this functional bread did not impact on SCFA production. A higher dose of black tea and β-glucan or in combination with other fibers may be needed to increase SCFA production."
