    "This work evaluates the experimental warming effects on phenology and grain yield components of wheat in the Yaqui Valley, Sonora, México, using CIRNO C2008 variety from Triticum durum L., as a model during the cropping cycle of 2016-2017 (December to April). Infrared radiators were deployed to induce experimental warming by 2 °C above ambient crop canopy temperature, in a temperature free-air controlled enhancement system. Temperature was controlled by infrared temperature sensors placed in eight plots which covered a circle of r = 1.5 m starting five days after germination until harvest. The warming treatment caused a reduction of phenophases occurrence starting at the stem extension phenophase. Such phenological responses generated a significant biological cycle reduction of 14 days. Despite this delay, CIRNO C2008 completed its biological cycle adequately. However, plant height under the warming treatment was reduced significantly and differences were particularly observed at the final phenophases of the vegetative cycle. Plant height correlated negatively with spikes length, spikes mass, and number of filled grains. Warming also reduced grain yield in 33%. The warming treatment caused a stress intensity (SI = 1-yield warming/yield control) of 39.4% and 33.2% in biomass and grain yield, respectively. The differences in stress intensities between biomass and grain yield were based on plant height reduction. Grain mass was not affected, demonstrating the crop capability for remobilization and adequate distribution of elaborated substances for the spikes under warming conditions."
