A 5.5% decrease in global wheat yields was caused by heat stress between 1980&#x02013;2008 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2011</xref>), while drought stress caused considerable yield loss and high economic costs in more than 50% of wheat cultivation areas (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf, 2010</xref>). Therefore, research into the genetic mechanism of heat and drought stress tolerance is getting increasingly important.</p><p>Plants have developed a range of response mechanisms to adjust to abiotic stress, especially molecular responses to maintain normal activities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Shinozaki and Dennis, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Mittler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2013</xref>). Genes responding to abiotic stress are essential for enhancing abiotic stress tolerance, and an understanding of these is crucial to developing abiotic stress-tolerant crops.</p><p>Protein kinases regulate key aspects of cellular function, including responses to external signals. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, around 4% of predicted genes encode typical protein kinases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hrabak et al., 2003</xref>). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK)-related kinases (PEPKRs) are unique to plants and belong to the CDPK-SnRK superfamily (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hrabak et al., 2003</xref>). PPCKs are calcium-independent protein kinases that function in crassulacean acid metabolism and C4 plants (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Vidal and Chollet, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Nimmo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agetsuma et al., 2004</xref>). Predicted PEPKR proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contain both N- and C-terminal extensions with no similarity to the non-catalytic domains of other kinases in this superfamily (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hrabak et al., 2003</xref>). Thus far, their functions remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we isolated the coding and promoter region of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic>, and analyzed the expression pattern of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> under heat and dehydration stress conditions.

These results indicate that <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also enhances thermotolerance.</p><p>To further investigate the performance of transgenic <italic>TaPEPKR2Arabidopsis</italic> plants, lines L1, L3, and L5 were selected for dehydration tolerance tests before bolting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). After dehydration stress (1 week after watering), around 95% of WT seedlings died, whereas 35&#x02013;70% of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> transgenic seedlings survived (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>). We further validated relative water loss rates of detached leaves (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,D</xref>). Compared with WT plants, lines L1, L3, and L5 displayed lower relative water loss rates, and the final relative water content of detached rosette leaves from lines L3 and L5 was significantly higher than that of controls. These results indicated that the overexpression of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> resulted in dehydration tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p><italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> transgenic plants show improved dehydration tolerance. <bold>(A)</bold> WT and <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> transgenic seedlings grown in soil were subjected to water deprivation for 25 days, then re-watered for &#x0223c;1 week. <bold>(B)</bold> Survival rates of WT and <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> transgenic plants after dehydration treatment.

SMART analysis revealed that the TaPEPKR2 protein sequence possessed a S_TKc motif (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> is a typical serine&#x02013;threonine protein kinase gene. Sequence alignment indicated that <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> shares 81.98% similarity with <italic>OsPEPKR2</italic>, 81.46% similarity with <italic>ZmPEPKR2</italic>, and 53.18% similarity with <italic>AtPEPKR2</italic>, suggesting that it is highly conserved. The S_TKc motif of PEPKRs showed the highest homology with PPCKs, however, PEPKR proteins contain both N- and C-terminal extensions without the PPCK superfamily (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hrabak et al., 2003</xref>). These results indicated that PEPKR and PPCK functions have commonalities but also exhibit differences.</p><p>The upstream sequence of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> was analyzed for the presence of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements by using the PlantCARE database (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S2</xref>). We found the promoter region of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> contained the putative CGTCA-motif/TGACG-motif, ABRE, Skn-1-motif/GCN4, TC-rich repeats, GARE-motif/TATC-box, TCA-element, MBS and WUN-motif, indicating the expression of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> could be regulated by several types of stresses, including abiotic and biotic stresses. The expression pattern is a direct indication of gene involvement in developmental events. In this study, <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> expression was induced during heat and dehydration stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); however, there was no report of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> homologs from other species previously. The expression pattern of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> homologous genes was analyzed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Weigelworld Database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref></sup> and Plant Expression Database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03">3</xref></sup>. In <italic>Arabidopsis, AtPEPKR2</italic> was induced by heat and drought stress within a small range. In durum wheat cv. Cappelli, neither heat stress nor drought stress alone could induce <italic>TdPEPKR2</italic> expression, however, this was achieved by a combination of the two. In durum wheat cv. Ofanto, <italic>TdPEPKR2</italic> was induced by heat stress within a small range, but not by drought stress. However, their combination significantly induced <italic>TdPEPKR2</italic> expression. In common, wheat drought sensitive cv. A24-39, <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> was weakly induced by drought stress, while in common wheat drought tolerant cv. Y12-3, <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> was significantly induced by drought stress (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Krugman et al., 2010</xref>). In barley caryopsis, the orthologous gene of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> (probe Barley1_05454) was induced by 0.5, 3, and 6 h heat stress treatment (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Mangelsen et al., 2010</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> and its orthologous genes induced by high temperature and dehydration hinted the function of <italic>PEPKR2</italic> in heat and drought tolerance.</p><p>Our results revealed that overexpression of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> in wheat imparted tolerance to heat and dehydration stresses compared to wild type plants. It was fist report about function of <italic>PEPKRs</italic> in plant. <italic>PEPKRs</italic> belonged to the CDPK-SnRK superfamily (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Hrabak et al., 2003</xref>). Not surprisingly, many of these kinases have been implicated in response to both heat and/or dehydration stresses. PEPKRs also called PPCK related kinases and shared catalytic domain with PPCK. Previous studies have concluded that PPCK activity in rice positively regulates PEPC activity during exposure to osmotic stress (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Feria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, PPCK gene expression and activity are regulated by signaling molecules such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Are there PEPRKs regulatory proteins which play important role in calcium and ROS homeostasis under abiotic stress? What potential specific substrates they have? Further studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in enhancing heat and dehydration stresses tolerance in TaPEPKR2-OE plants. Relative expression levels of the genes functioning in ABA biosynthesis (<italic>ABA1</italic>, AT5G67030), signaling (<italic>ABI3</italic>, AT3G24650), <italic>heat shock protein 70</italic> (<italic>HSP70</italic>, AT3G12580), and <italic>17.6A</italic> (<italic>HSP17.6A</italic>, AT5G12030) were investigated in <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>). The expressions of <italic>ABA1</italic> and <italic>HSP70</italic> were found to be unchanged, however, <italic>ABI3</italic> and <italic>HSP17.6A</italic> were elevated constitutively. These results present some clues of <italic>TaPEPKR2</italic> regulating ABA signaling and heat shock proteins in heat and dehydration stresses.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>QS, HP, and XZ designed the research.
