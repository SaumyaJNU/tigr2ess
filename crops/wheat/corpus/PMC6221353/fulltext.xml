Since the most effective sources of FHB resistance are typically associated with unfavorable agronomic traits, breeding commercial cultivars that combine desired agronomic traits and a high level of FHB resistance remains a considerable challenge. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing FHB resistance will help to design more efficient and precise breeding strategies. Here, multiple molecular tools and assays were deployed to compare the resistant variety Sumai3 with three regionally adapted Canadian cultivars. Macroscopic and microscopic disease evaluation established the relative level of Type II FHB resistance of the four varieties and revealed that the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> infection process displayed substantial temporal differences among organs. The rachis was found to play a critical role in preventing <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> spread within spikes. Large-scale, organ-specific RNA-seq at different times after <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> infection demonstrated that diverse defense mechanisms were expressed faster and more intensely in the spikelet of resistant varieties. The roles of plant hormones during the interaction of wheat with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> was inferred based on the transcriptomic data obtained and the quantification of the major plant hormones. Salicylic acid and jasmonic acid were found to play predominantly positive roles in FHB resistance, whereas auxin and ABA were associated with susceptibility, and ethylene appeared to play a dual role during the interaction with <italic>F graminearum</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was undertaken as part of the Wheat Improvement Flagship Program, which is the National Research Council of Canada&#x02019;s contribution to the Canadian Wheat Alliance.

[<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The fungus invades wheat spike tissues and causes disease through a series of complex processes and mechanisms. In general, airborne <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> spores attach and germinate onto flowering spikelets. Subcuticular and intercellular growth of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> has been observed during the first 2 days post infection (dpi), suggesting a biotrophic phase in advance of necrotization of the plant tissue by intracellular hyphae [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Necrotrophic growth and nutrition is facilitated by the secretion of proteases and mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON) [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At 3 or 4 dpi, extensive, unbranched inter- and intracellular hyphae are present throughout the ovary and floral brackets, which subsequently display dark-brown, water-soaked symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207036.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. After 5 dpi, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> hyphae pass the rachilla of the inoculated spikelet and enter the cortex of the rachis node [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several days after entry into the rachis, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> hyphae invade uninoculated spikelets, resulting in severe dark-brown, water-soaked disease symptoms that eventually cause premature bleaching of the wheat spike [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Host resistance is broadly considered as the most economical, ecofriendly and efficient approach to control FHB [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Three or more major types of FHB resistance are recognized and used in wheat breeding programs: resistance to initial infection (type I); resistance to spread within a spike (type II); and resistance to mycotoxin accumulation in grain (type III). Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing FHB resistance, much remains elusive. Analysis has been complicated by the complex genetic base of FHB resistance, governed by a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), and the elaborate structure of the wheat spike that possesses multiple organs and undergoes various developmental processes following infection by <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These developmental processes are largely regulated through networks coordinated by plant hormones [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Alteration of hormonal balances may result in poor spikelet development [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], reduction in grain weight [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and quality in wheat [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several hormone pathways also regulate immune responses to microbial pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To survive, plant cells reallocate limited resources and energy from growth processes to deal with pathogen attack [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], phenomena called growth-defense tradeoffs, which are largely regulated by fine-tuning of hormones effects to achieve optimum fitness. Intriguingly, successful pathogens have evolved mechanisms to manipulate or subvert plant hormone signaling pathways to facilitate pathogen infection and disease development [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Most existing FHB resistance is associated with other unfavorable agronomic traits [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In-depth investigation of molecular interactions between <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> and wheat will help us to better understand this complex trait and to design more efficient and precise breeding strategies. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of FHB resistance were investigated by comparing the resistant variety Sumai3 with three regionally adapted Canadian cultivars. The extent of FHB resistance in four varieties was determined macroscopically and microscopically through a comprehensive disease evaluation strategy. Large-scale, organ-specific RNA-seq and hormone profiling experiments were performed on the four varieties after <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> infection. Compared with &#x0201c;bulk material&#x0201d;, organ-specific analyses prevent averaged information and diluted signals, and provide more accurate and precise information [<xref rid="pone.0207036.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is particularly important for <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic> infected wheat spikes, which are composed of multiple organs. From this analysis, the role of several plant hormones is proposed during interaction with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum</italic>, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), auxin and abscisic acid (ABA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>All experiments were conducted in environment-controlled growth chambers.
