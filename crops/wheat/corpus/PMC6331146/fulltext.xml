However, there is limited information on the utility of serum zonulin to indicate gastrointestinal disease and the validity of zonulin detection in widely-used commercial assays. The current study reports differences in zonulin levels across patient groups with gastrointestinal dysfunction compared with healthy individuals, though methodological inconsistencies indicated that actual zonulin protein was not detected by the commercial assays applied. The nature of the assays&#x02019; detected antigen was investigated using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by protein staining. Top matches of the assays&#x02019; detected antigen included haptoglobin and complement C3 for the assay manufactured by CUSABIO (Wuhan, China) and complement C3 for the assay manufactured by Immundiagnostik AG (Bensheim, Germany). These findings confirm that current commercial zonulin assays are not detecting the actual protein as prehaptoglobin-2. Until assay methodology is improved, we advise the greater scientific and medical community to exercise caution in considering the measurement of serum zonulin as a marker of mucosal barrier integrity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MA received a Fulbright Scholarship from the Australian-American Fulbright Commission (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fulbright.org.au/">https://www.fulbright.org.au/</ext-link>) to undertake research.

An increasing number of studies point to an additional role of the gut epithelium and associated structures, along with gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the neuroendocrine network, as regulators in the passage of environmental antigens from the intestinal lumen into the sub-mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the proposed paradigm, dysregulation of the mucosal barrier leads to the increased passage of antigens and other macromolecules from the external environment into the host and initiates local and/or systemic inflammation and immune activation; this process attributed to &#x0201c;gut leakiness&#x0201d; influences tolerance and immunity.</p><p>Antigens and macromolecules may pass through the epithelial barrier via transcellular or paracellular pathways. The transcellular pathway usually involves the action of passive or active transport channels for specific substrates [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The paracellular pathway filters by charge and size, and is a key route of entry for macromolecules [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells are directly implicated in the paracellular route and establish a concentration gradient that is important for both transcellular and paracellular transport [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As such, these structures are the rate-limiting step in transepithelial transport and are central determinants of mucosal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The protein, zonulin, is capable of reversible tight junction disassembly and, therefore, is implicated in the regulation of mucosal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Zonulin was first discovered as an endogenous human analogue of the bacterial enterotoxin, zonula occludens toxin (Zot), which is produced by the intestinal bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To initiate tight junction disassembly, it is proposed that zonulin activates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through proteinase activated receptor 2 (PAR<sub>2</sub>) as well as G protein-coupled receptor PAR<sub>2</sub>, which transactivates EGFR [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Activation of these two receptors decreases transepithelial electrical resistance, therefore implicating increased intestinal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The observation that Zot activates intracellular cascades that lead to protein kinase C &#x003b1;-mediated actin polymerization suggests that cytoskeleton modulation is involved in enhancing intestinal permeability [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As Zot and zonulin are analogues, a similar mechanism of activation associated with zonulin is suspected.</p><p>As the precursor to haptoglobin-2, zonulin belongs to the haptoglobin family of proteins. Haptoglobins are acute-phase reaction proteins that have a primary role in haemoglobin scavenging, in which they form a complex with haemoglobin to prevent oxidative damage to the haemoglobin itself and surrounding tissues [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Haptoglobins also exert angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Three genetic polymorphisms in human haptoglobin expression, Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2, are determined by the <italic>HP1</italic> and <italic>HP2</italic> alleles harboured by chromosome 16q22 [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As zonulin is the precursor to haptoglobin-2, individuals who bear the heterozygous Hp2-1 or homozygous Hp2-2 polymorphism are zonulin-producers whereas those with the homozygous Hp1-1 polymorphism are unable to produce zonulin. Dimerisation of haptoglobins occurs cotranslationally and proteolytic cleavage from precursor to active forms takes place while still in the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As such, the endoplasmic reticulum contains the highest amounts of zonulin as uncleaved, pre-Hp2, yet zonulin has been reported to be measured extracellularly and detectable in human sera [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Dysregulation of the zonulin pathway and subsequent &#x0201c;gut leakiness&#x0201d; due to increased intestinal permeability has been associated with the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders such as coeliac disease, non-coeliac wheat sensitivity/irritable bowel syndrome (NCWS/IBS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Autoimmune, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases have also been implicated [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To date, there has been one conference proceeding that sought to characterise circulating levels of zonulin in NCWS, IBS and coeliac disease, and found significantly higher levels in all patient groups compared to healthy individuals (p&#x0003c;0.001) using a commercial assay manufactured by CUSABIO (Wuhan, China) [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the limited evidence, commercial zonulin assays have been widely used as a convenient method to assess intestinal permeability in a variety of clinical conditions beyond gastrointestinal disease. In a recent PubMed and Google Scholar search, 10 publications used the commercial assay by CUSABIO and 61 publications used a commercial assay by Immundiagnostik AG (Bensheim, Germany) to detect human plasma or serum levels of zonulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210728.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Zonulin has received considerable attention for its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disease and candidacy as a biomarker of intestinal barrier dysfunction, yet the strength of evidence that it is a specific, reliable serum marker of disease has yet to be examined. In the present study, the primary aim was to measure serum zonulin levels in patients with well-characterised NCWS, coeliac disease, and acute severe ulcerative colitis as well as healthy controls using commercial zonulin assays. However, due to methodological shortcomings in these assays, we sought to determine whether the assays are reliably detecting zonulin as prehaptoglobin-2 and if not, what they may be detecting instead. To accomplish this, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments followed by mass spectrometric analysis and SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining. The results from our study resolve whether serum zonulin, as measured by current commercial assays, is a useful marker of gastrointestinal dysfunction and mucosal barrier integrity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Serum samples were collected from well-characterised patients and healthy individuals between the ages of 16 and 70 years living in Melbourne, Australia.

Despite its wide use to assess intestinal mucosal barrier integrity in clinical conditions where a &#x0201c;leaky gut&#x0201d; is suspected, there has been limited information on zonulin levels in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction. In the current study, sera from well-characterised patient cohorts and controls were used to assess zonulin&#x02019;s utility as a serological marker of gastrointestinal dysfunction and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. However, the current commercial assays had significant methodological inconsistencies. Upon further investigation, the assays failed to detect recombinant zonulin/prehaptoglobin-2 protein.</p><p>The first indicator of methodological inconsistency involved an inquiry into the assays&#x02019; capture antibodies. The epitope to which CUSABIO assay capture antibodies were raised remained unknown and enquiries to the manufacturer remained unanswered (communication with customer service, CUSABIO, Wuhan, China). In contrast, the alternative commercial assay by Immundiagnostik clearly indicated an epitope to which capture antibodies are raised (communication with customer service, Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany). This epitope is <monospace>GGVLVQPG</monospace>, a peptide sequence synthetically manufactured as AT-1001 or larazotide acetate [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the purported zonulin receptor has an affinity for this epitope, it remained unclear whether the generation of capture antibodies raised to this sequence would bind to actual circulating zonulin. Another inconsistency was the assays&#x02019; apparent detection of zonulin in individuals bearing the Hp1-1 phenotype (i.e. in zonulin non-producers). There was also poor strength of relationship between both commercial assays advertised to detect the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Taken together, these inconsistencies casted initial doubt on the utility of the commercial assays to detect circulating zonulin.</p><p>In order to confirm whether these assays are actually detecting zonulin, the recombinant zonulin protein as prehaptoglobin-2, which has been used in principal studies that characterise the protein and demonstrate its ability to decrease transepithelial electrical resistance, was tested in both assays [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dose-responses or signals to high concentrations were not observed; as such, the inability of recombinant zonulin to bind to captured antibodies was confirmed. In support of our ongoing observations, a publication was concurrently released which claimed that the Immundiagnostik assay was not detecting zonulin as advertised, but complement C3 instead [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using an adapted protocol, the captured serum antigens as well as other components from both assays were immunoprecipitated then analysed by mass spectrometry. Our results paralleled those of that publication, as the top match for the Immundiagnostik assay immunoprecipitation product when incubated with serum was complement C3. The serum protein product immunoprecipitated from the CUSABIO assay was best matched with haptoglobin and complement C3. However, addition of recombinant zonulin to both assays did not yield any significant immunoprecipitated protein product as indicated by silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, Lanes 3 and 4). Trace amounts of haptoglobin were detected by mass spectrometry and very slight silver staining was observed for the CUSABIO assay immunoprecipitated product as a result of incubation with recombinant zonulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210728.s002">S1 File</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, Lane 3). Albumin was the only significant mass spectrometry match and no visual staining was observed for the Immundiagnostik assay immunoprecipitated product as a result of incubation with recombinant zonulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210728.s002">S1 File</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, Lane 4). These results confirmed that the current commercial assays are not detecting the protein as advertised and were sufficient evidence to discontinue any further testing of our cohorts and use of our resources.</p><p>A follow-up publication by the same group that identified complement C3 as the primary candidate of Immundiagnostik zonulin assay detection took further steps in the characterisation of captured antigens [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, they found that the principal mass spectrometry candidate protein, complement C3, was not detected by the immunoassay. Instead, properdin, a complement-associated and &#x0201c;zonulin-like&#x0201d; protein emerged as the likely candidate of assay detection. Properdin was not detected in our mass spectrometry results for either assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210728.s002">S1 File</xref>) and was a low abundance match in the group&#x02019;s mass spectrometry results. The group found that Immundiagnostik assay antibodies as well as antibodies raised to recombinant zonulin cross-reacted to this protein, which is of a similar molecular weight (~50 kDa) compared to zonulin. As such, results remain inconclusive, indicating the necessity of additional studies to establish the true identity of target proteins associated with the Immundiagnostik assay, which they assume to be part of the zonulin family.</p><p>Our results also hold the same conclusion for the inefficacy of the CUSABIO assay, which does not detect recombinant zonulin. In addition, neither complement C3 nor haptoglobin, despite both being candidate target proteins as determined by mass spectrometry, was detected by the CUSABIO assay. Consequently, we are unable to make valid interpretations of our results with respect to our study cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, we found this assay to have a different capture antibody than the Immundiagnostik assay, which differs from conclusions made by Scheffler et al. In both primary and follow-up publications, the authors list a table with studies that use the Immundiagnostik assay with a note that &#x0201c;the kit sold by other companies (e.g., ALPCO) is the same as the Immundiagnostik kit&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our results do not agree with this claim, as there was poor strength of relationship between both commercial assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and the immunoprecipitation protein products of both assays differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210728.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This indicates distinctive capture antibodies for both commercial assays.</p><p>Complement-associated and haptoglobin proteins share similar homology, and both complement C3 and haptoglobin have also been detected together as candidate serological biomarkers by mass spectrometry in an extra-intestinal study [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-chain of haptoglobin contains a complement control protein domain, which is a characteristic component of proteins involved in the regulation of complement (e.g., complement factors H and C1r, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteinases and C1 receptor) [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Prohaptoglobin is cleaved by complement C1r-like protein, though it does not cleave to the preform of C1s, which is a similar protein to prehaptoglobin-2 [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been, therefore, hypothesised that the activity of Cr-like protein modulates zonulin production [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As such, the close association and shared homology between haptoglobin and complement-associated proteins introduces difficulty in the identification of specific markers by current methods and their roles in the mechanisms of disease. Recent studies show a potential role for complement C3, which is synthesised by murine intestinal epithelial cells, in modulating intestinal barrier integrity [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210728.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Whether complement C3 acts in synergy with or is independent of the proposed zonulin pathway in the modulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier is an avenue for further study.</p><p>In conclusion, the current commercial zonulin ELISA assays investigated in this study detect different proteins, neither of which was zonulin. Therefore, there can be no value of circulating concentrations in assessing intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and permeability until the target proteins are indeed identified. The identification of such anomalies should be highlighted to researchers to avoid wasting expenditure of time, money, and precious clinical samples. A monoclonal antibody directed towards human zonulin has been developed for use in western blot analysis, as indicated in the methods of Scheffler et al., though screening zonulin levels by this method of analysis is less quantitative and not preferable for use in the clinical setting compared to an ELISA assay [<xref rid="pone.0210728.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Commercial ELISA detection methodology may be improved with the development of specific and reliable monoclonal capture and detection antibodies to recombinant zonulin/prehaptoglobin-2 protein. Until assay methodology is improved, we urge the greater scientific and medical community to exercise caution in considering the measurement of serum zonulin as a marker of intestinal barrier dysfunction and permeability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210728.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Plasma or serum CUSABIO and Immundiagnostik commercial assay use in publications.</title><p>Google Scholar and PubMed search term: &#x0201c;zonulin.&#x0201d; Content was last updated August 7, 2018.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210728.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210728.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Full acquisition of mass spectrometry data for assay standards and each immunoprecipitation experiments described.</title><p>Spreadsheet tabs indicate specific assay standard or immunoprecipitation experiment.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210728.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the Australian-American Fulbright Commission for providing a Fulbright Scholarship to Ms. Mary Ajamian to undertake this research.
