    "Penicillium citrinum is a food-contaminating ascomycete that consistently produces large amounts of the mycotoxin citrinin. Citrinin exhibits, besides its toxicity, antibiotic effects and thus potentially forces antibiotic resistance. Within the genome sequence, we identified the biosynthesis gene cluster for citrinin, which appears to be highly conserved within the genus Penicillium."
