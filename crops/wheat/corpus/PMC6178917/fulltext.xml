Here, the ability of these consortia to degrade <italic>ex vivo</italic> lignocellulosic biomass in anaerobic bioreactors was characterized in term of bioprocess performances, enzymatic activities and bacterial community structure. In a preliminary screening, guts of <italic>Ergates faber</italic> (beetle), <italic>Potosia cuprea</italic> (chafer), <italic>Gromphadorrhina portentosa</italic> (cockroach), <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (locust), and <italic>Gryllus bimaculatus</italic> (cricket) were inoculated in anaerobic batch reactors, in presence of grounded wheat straw at neutral pH. A short duration fermentation of less than 8 days was observed and was related to a drop of pH from 7 to below 4.5, leading to an interruption of gas and metabolites production. Consistently, a maximum of 180 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> of metabolites accumulated in the medium, which was related to a low degradation of the lignocellulosic biomass, with a maximum of 5 and 2.2% observed for chafer and locust gut consortia. The initial cell-bound and extracellular enzyme activities, i.e., xylanase and &#x003b2;-endoglucanase, were similar to values observed in the literature. Wheat straw fermentation in bioreactors leads to an increase of cell-bounded enzyme activities, with an increase of 145% for cockroach xylanase activity. Bacterial community structures were insect dependent and mainly composed of Clostridia, Bacteroidia and Gammaproteobacteria. Improvement of lignocellulose biodegradation was operated in successive batch mode at pH 8 using the most interesting consortia, i.e., locust, cockroaches and chafer gut consortia. In these conditions, lignocellulose degradation increased significantly: 8.4, 10.5, and 21.0% of the initial COD were degraded for chafer, cockroaches and locusts, respectively in 15 days. Consistently, xylanase activity tripled for the three consortia, attesting the improvement of the process. Bacteroidia was the major bacterial class represented in the bacterial community for all consortia, followed by Clostridia and Gammaproteobacteria classes. This work demonstrates the possibility to maintain apart of insect gut biological activity <italic>ex vivo</italic> and shows that lignocellulose biodegradation can be improved by using a biomimetic approach. These results bring new insights for the optimization of lignocellulose degradation in bioreactors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fermentation</kwd><kwd>biomimetism</kwd><kwd>insect guts</kwd><kwd>volatile fatty acids</kwd><kwd>microbial diversity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>With the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, it is nowadays important to find other ways to produce energy from renewable resources, and using environmental-friendly processes. The production of energy and chemicals by the enzymatic and/or microbial deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass appears to be very attractive as lignocellulose is the most abundant renewable source of polysaccharides on earth and it is not in competition with food production (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Carriquiry et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Lignocellulose is the principal structural component of plant cell wall which is composed of three major components: lignin, hemicelluloses, and cellulose (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Menon and Rao, 2012</xref>). It is found in the most of industrial and agricultural wastes. Because of its complex structure and composition, it is for plant a natural barrier against biological attack (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">F&#x000fc;rstenberg-H&#x000e4;gg et al., 2013</xref>). However, this property is also an issue in the context of the biorefinery. During anaerobic digestion, the conversion efficiency of raw lignocellulosic biomass hardly reaches 30% (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sawatdeenarunat et al., 2015</xref>). To increase the biodegradability of lignocellulose and its conversion into bioenergy, pretreatments that are often expensive and not environmentally friendly need to be applied (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In Nature, different lignocellulose degradation processes exist that rely on combined action of a large number of microorganisms that produce lignocellulolytic enzymes, combined with other biotic and abiotic agents. These include the microbiome presents in the digestive tract of herbivorous and phytophagous organisms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Godon et al., 2013</xref>). Among them, phytophagous and xylophagous insects have been identified as one of the most effective lignocellulose digesters (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Rizzi et al., 2013</xref>). Higher-termites are able to recycle 65&#x02013;99% of the ingested cellulose and hemicelluloses respectively, whereas some scarabs can degrade up to 65% of the fibers present in their diet (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cazemier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ohkuma, 2003</xref>). Since few decades, efforts are focused on the understanding of lignocellulose degradation in insect digestive tracts in order to use this knowledge to improve biomass conversion efficiency in bioreactors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brune, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The gut of insects is divided into three parts, namely foregut, midgut and hindgut (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe and Tokuda, 2010</xref>). The foregut is the place where mechanical treatments occur in order to reduce food particle size to less than 50 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bayan&#x000e9; and Guiot, 2011</xref>). The midgut has been identified as mainly anaerobic and alkaline with a pH close to 9&#x02013;10, as usually used for alkaline chemical pretreatments, which are performed as an upstream process to delignify, expand fibers and increase biomass porosity and surface area (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe and Tokuda, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Monlau et al., 2015</xref>). Biological treatment, i.e., endogenous alkaline-tolerant enzymes such as cellulases (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Willis et al., 2010</xref>) is associated with the chemical treatment to increase the lignocellulose hydrolysis. Finally, the hindgut is the compartment where symbiotic microorganisms are hosted and achieve the degradation of the remaining biomass (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe and Tokuda, 2010</xref>). Indeed, working on lower termites, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Breznak and Brune (1994)</xref> have shown that the bacterial flora is essential to biomass conversion and to the survival of insects.</p><p>The bacterial microbiota represents nearly a quarter of the insect weight and is mostly composed of protozoans and fermentative bacteria mainly belonging to four orders, i.e., Lactobacillales, Clostridiales, Bacillales, and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). They ferment polysaccharides into acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, using similar metabolic pathways as observed for dark fermentation as described by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al. (2010)</xref>.</p><p>To date, most of the research has been focused on the exploitation and cloning of endogenous or exogenous lignocellulolytic enzymes found in insects gut (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Willis et al., 2010</xref>). Used in upstream pretreatment, these enzymes hydrolyse the raw biomass and release simple and fermentable sugars that will then be converted into valuable product. Very few articles had implemented the entire gut microbiomes in bioreactors and analyzed the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hamdi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Auer et al., 2017</xref>). The advantage of using the whole microbiome resides in the robustness of the microbiome upon process variation such as change in substrate or operating conditions. Indeed, conversely to enzymes cocktail, entire gut microbiomes express a larger range of enzymes activities that are for interest in lignocellulose degradation.</p><p>In the present work, we examined in batch bioreactors the degradation activity of microbiomes from five xylophagous or phytophagous insects belonging to five different families in bioreactors. Our approach proposes to directly inoculate the whole microbiome of insects guts in anaerobic bioreactors using wheat straw as carbon source. The degradation of wheat straw was estimated in batch and successive batch conditions, without and with controlled pH respectively. The batch mode was limited due to acidification caused by fermentation. The three most performant consortia were then implemented in successive batch reactors with a pH controlled at 8. Changes of microbial diversity and enzyme activities were assessed throughout the wheat straw degradation processes; the feasibility of <italic>ex vivo</italic> utilization of guts microbiome is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Selected Insects, Insect Gut Preparation, and Lignocellulosic Substrate</title><p>Five species of insects were selected based on prior knowledge on their phytophagous or xylophagous diet and the availability of species in France.

A fourth flask was prepared without straw as a control in order to follow the metabolite production due to the degradation of residual gut tissues (named blank reactors: BR).</p><p>WSR and BR were operated under strict anaerobic conditions by sealing the flasks with rubber septa and flushing them with nitrogen for 10 min. Flasks were incubated for 15 days at 30&#x000b0;C with shaking at 150 rpm in an INNOVA43 incubator. During the incubation period, metabolites production (biogas and volatile fatty acid-VFA) was monitored at regular intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Successive Batch Reactors</title><p>To demonstrate the lignocellulose biodegradation ability of insect gut derived microbiomes, successive batch reactors (three successive batch named WS-SBR-1, WS-SBR-2, and WS-SBR3) were inoculated with the three selected consortia: cockroach, locust and chafer microbiomes. The successive batch reactor tests were conducted in successive batch modes. The initial volume was 400 mL of medium (described above) containing wheat straw (20 g&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>). To standardize the number of bacteria per inoculum, the amount of 16S copies quantified by qPCR was used and the estimated number of bacteria was made with an average of 3.6 copies per genome (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The substrate to inoculum mass ratio was then 7.47 for chafer, 2.5 for cockroach and 0.53 for locust. Bioreactors were maintained under anaerobic conditions at 30&#x000b0;C, under agitation at 300 rpm. The pH was monitored and controlled manually to 8 by addition of NaOH 1M once a day if needed. Throughout the incubation time, liquid samples were withdrawn regularly to analyze the production of soluble metabolites, enzymatic activities and microbial diversity. For diversity analysis, samples were immediately frozen at 80&#x000b0;C. After sampling, the working volume was completed to 400 mL for each reactor with 20 g&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> of wheat straw suspension in the minimum medium, which correspond to around 130&#x02013;200 mL of medium depending the insect guts microbiomes considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate Characterization, Fermentation Products (Organic Acids), and Gas Analysis, Determination of Substrate Degradation</title><p>The wheat straw was composed of 94.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 g of total solids per 100 g of wheat straw and 89.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 g of volatile solids per 100 g of wheat straw The polysaccharide composition was determined by HPLC after acid hydrolysis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Monlau et al., 2012</xref>) and contained 18.7 &#x000b1; 1.7% glucose; 16.5 &#x000b1; 0.6% of xylose, 1.9 &#x000b1; 0.0% of arabinose.

The fermentation products, i.e., VFA and gasses, were quantified to compare the insect microbiota potential to convert wheat straw.</p><p>The fermentation was quite short for all insects in reactors since maxima of biogas and VFA produced were respectively reached before 100 h (4 days) and 200 h (8 days) of fermentation, (not shown). The pH of the broth varied from 7 (initial value) to 4.5 (final value). At such a low pH, hydrolysis and fermentation reactions are known to be blocked, which might explain the fermentation stop after several days (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Veeken et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The volatile fatty acids (VFA) quantities already found in the medium before the fermentation process (T0), and the VFA and gas that accumulated at the end of the experiment (Tf) for both Blank Reactors (BR) and Wheat Straw Reactors (WSR) are shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>. Quantities are expressed as chemical oxygen demand equivalent (mg<sub>eq.COD</sub>) to then be able to compare wheat straw degradation in function of introduced insect guts. The analysis of initial metabolites present in BR (corresponding to the quantity presents in the guts) and in WSR showed a nearly absence of organic acids except for crickets and cockroach guts microbiomes with acetate as the main product (10.9, 5.8 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for WSR and 2.8, 9.5 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for BR, respectively). Before the fermentation process, acetate was present in low quantity in all bioreactors containing wheat straw (WSR), with a maximum of 10.9 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> of acetate measured in bioreactors inoculated with cricket microbiomes. The presence of acetate in insect guts is consistent with the literature since it is generally the main final product of cellulose degradation in these biological systems (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Production and repartition of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and gasses in mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> observed in <bold>(A)</bold> blank reactors -BR- and <bold>(B)</bold> wheat straw reactors &#x02013;WSR.

Measured gasses are hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). WSR reactors were fed with wheat straw and BR contained insect gut without wheat straw.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-09-02222-g001"/></fig><p>At the end of the experiment, the quantity of VFA and gas largely increased in all reactors, as an evidence of biological activity and biomass degradation. In BR, the presence of biodegradable compounds in insect guts and gut tissues can explain the production of metabolites in absence of wheat straw. In all cases, the biogas produced was composed of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (about 30 and 50%, respectively), with sometimes the presence of small quantities of methane. The production of H<sub>2</sub> in insect guts has been identified as the result of cellulose degradation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Breznak and Brune, 1994</xref>). In the gut, other microorganisms transform then H<sub>2</sub> into CH<sub>4</sub>, but this conversion is generally produced under strict environmental conditions and neutral pH. The drop of pH to 4.5 probably prevented methane production in the present study. Considering COD equivalents (eq. COD), H<sub>2</sub> produced in WSR represented about 5% of total COD produced. Locust and beetle microbiota generated the highest quantity of H<sub>2</sub> with respectively 12.4 and 8.6 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub>, followed by crickets (5.9 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub>). The lowest production of hydrogen was observed for chafers microbiota with 0.5 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub>, respectively. Concerning BR, the H<sub>2</sub> produced ranged from 0.4 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> in cockroach reactors to 3.9 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> in locust reactors. As stated before, BR only contained gut tissues as substrate, biomass richer in protein than wheat straw. This difference of substrate resulted in a lower production of hydrogen in BR. It has been observed elsewhere that hindgut of crickets fed on rich protein diet generates 3.5 times less of H<sub>2</sub> than hindgut of cricket fed on lignocellulosic biomass (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Santo Domingo et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The production of VFA in WSR ranged from 150 to 180 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for chafer, locust, cockroach and cricket microbiota, whereas only 50 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> were measured in reactors inoculated with beetles microbiota. VFA produced were essentially acetate with 28 and 70 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> measured in beetle and chafer bioreactors, respectively. Except for beetles, propionate was produced in similar quantity for all insects, ranging from 27 to 62 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for chafer and locust, respectively. In control reactors (BR), the main VFAs produced were acetate, with 14&#x02013;58 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for beetles and cockroaches reactors respectively, and propionate with 11&#x02013;45 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub> for beetles and cockroaches reactors respectively. In chafer reactors, a large part of butyrate was produced corresponding to 23 mg<sub>eq.COD</sub>. In all reactors, the presence VFA such as butyrate, valerate and their isomers can be the result of the sudden stop of fermentation due to pH drop as mentioned above. Indeed, in insect gut, complex biomass such as cellulose is first hydrolyzed and converted into three or more carbon organic acids, which are further converted into acetate, hydrogen and finally methane (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Breznak and Brune, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Considering the COD recovered only as metabolites enabled to estimate a net wheat straw degradation (that could be related to lignocellulose degradation) which is maximal for chafer (5%), followed by locust (2.2%), cricket (1%), and beetle (0.3%) microbiomes (<bold>Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></bold>). The corresponding value for cockroach microbiomes could not be determined since the quantity of COD produced in BR, containing only gut tissues, was higher than that measured in WSR. As previously mentioned, this low proportion of biomass degraded could result from the pH drop observed after few days of incubation, but also by the experimental conditions that were not optimized for gut microbiomes. A neutral pH was selected for this experiment, as it is a value usually used in anaerobic digestion and because is usually encountered in hindgut of most insects (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Engel and Moran, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brune, 2014</xref>). However, lignocellulose degradation is higher in insect gut particularly when alkaline conditions prevail since high pH promotes the cleavage of lignin-carbohydrate complex (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Engel and Moran, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brune, 2014</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Biodegradation yield of wheat straw introduced in batch reactors (in % of eq.COD).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Insect guts microbiomes</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cockroach</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chafer</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beetle</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cricket</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Locust</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% Degradation of wheat straw (eq.COD)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">/</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The quantity of gut tissues used as reactors inocula could have negatively affected lignocellulose degradation. Indeed, the biodegradation of this organic biomass is easier than that of wheat straw. Thus, the lignocellulosic biomass would be attacked only after gut tissues were converted into metabolites. This assumption could be confirmed through the degradation of initial COD in BR since between 12 and 46% of gut COD were converted into metabolites (data not shown) whereas only a maximum of 5% for wheat straw was degraded.</p><p>Using a pH value close to neutral conditions but slightly alkaline as measured in insect guts (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref></bold>) and implementing a pH control might improve lignocellulose degradation rate.

The maximal xylanase activities after the fermentation period were observed for beetle (276 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>) and cockroach (156 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>). These last insect gut microbiomes, therefore, seemed to have a higher initial potential to degrade xylan. A similar xylanase activity value (200 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>) was previously obtained by <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lazuka et al. (2015)</xref> using rumen microbiomes as inoculum to degrade wheat straw in anaerobic bioreactors. However, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. (2010)</xref> observed a xylanase activity of 0.1 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> for woodborer insect guts. In this study, xylanase activity was performed on the juice content of the guts after dissection. In the present study, initial xylanase activity was mainly detected in the pellets meaning that the enzymes were preferentially cell-bound. One exception is noted for beetles with the maximum activity detected in the supernatant. Cell bounded hydrolytic enzymes have also been identified in rumen when this microbiomes was used as inoculum for wheat straw degradation in the study of <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lazuka et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p>Regarding CMCase activity, its initial activity (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B1</xref></bold>) was also higher in the pellet than in the supernatant for all insects. The highest global activity was observed for beetle and cockroach with 91 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> and 67 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively and the lowest was measured in chafer reactors at 9 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>. In their study, Lazuka et al. observed an initial CMCase activity close to 20 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>. But higher endoglucanase activity was observed for the sugarcane borer <italic>Diatraea saccharalis</italic> larvae, with free enzymatic activity of 200&#x02013;300 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dantur et al., 2015</xref>). In this case, enzymatic activity was performed after selection of intestinal bacteria on cellulose as sole carbon source, which are thus supposed to exhibit higher endoglucanase activity that observed in the present study.</p><p>After the fermentation process, a global increase of enzymatic activities was observed, from 22 to 145% for xylanase and 5&#x02013;128% for CMCase. The increase of activity was higher in the pellet with a maximum of 221% observed for xylanase activity in cockroach microbiome. At the opposite, the free enzyme activities, measured in the supernatant, globally decreased for chafer, beetle (xylanase) and cricket (CMCase).</p><p>Chafer microbiomes exhibit the lowest enzymatic activities both with and without wheat straw (94 and 12 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> for respectively pellet and supernatant activities and 17 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> for pellet CMCase activity, supernatant CMCase activity was too low to be detected).</p><p>In comparison with rumen microbiome systems, the xylanase activity measured after wheat straw degradation was higher than observed in the present study, with values reaching 800 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lazuka et al., 2015</xref>). At the opposite, the same authors reported a CMCase activity of 40 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>, similar to the value obtained here for chafer, but 2&#x02013;6 times lower than the CMCase activity observed for the other insects.</p><p>The xylanase and CMCase activities of beetle gut microbiomes measured in the present study were quite the same at both initial and final stage. One hypothesis could be that beetle larvae were harvested in dead pine trunks (wood eater). Therefore, the difference between initial and final activity is lower since at initial stage a high potential to degrade xylan and cellulose was already detected.</p><p>Enzymatic activity, which represents a global degradation rate, was standardized by the 16S rRNA copies present in the sample which correspond to the witness of microbial biomass quantity. In this case, locust microbiomes exhibited the highest specific enzyme activities at initial and final stage whereas chafer guts microbiota still had the lowest specific enzyme activities (data not shown). It is striking to note that the specific enzyme activity decreased considerably between the beginning and the end of the experiment. Indeed, even if the global activity was quite the same, the bacterial growth resulted in an increase of 16S copies. At the end of the experiment, the global activity was similar to that of the beginning, but when considering the growth of bacteria, the specific activity was considerably reduced. Here again, the drastic drop of pH observed above can explain the decrease of enzymatic activity at the end of the process. Sampling during the fermentation period could have shown an increase of enzymatic activity during the exponential step of degradation.</p><p>Regarding specific enzymatic activity results, locust microbiota is an interesting candidate since it exhibits high xylanase and CMCase specific activities. Enrichment of such population could be interesting for developing lignocellulose degradation bioprocesses.</p></sec><sec><title>Distribution and Bacterial Community Structures Across Samples Before and After Wheat Straw Fermentation in Batch Experiments</title><p>Microbiomes from the insect gut s introduced in the bioreactors were sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina technology.

Little information is available concerning implementation and taming of insect guts microbiomes as a whole in bioreactors. Some articles related to utilization of termite guts protein extracts (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rajarapu and Scharf, 2017</xref>) or microbiomes as a whole (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hamdi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Auer et al., 2017</xref>) but to our knowledge no information could be found concerning other type of insects implemented in bioreactors.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic Activities Measured for the Three Selected Microbiota</title><p>The enzyme activity was measured during the fermentation.

These results might be explained by the conditions used for the successive batch reactors (monitoring and control of pH at 8) which appeared as more appropriate for these microbiomes. This global higher enzymatic activity was also observed through the degradation yield of wheat straw. Comparing the activity between insect shows that cockroach and locust guts microbiomes present the same enzymatic activities whereas chafer displayed significantly lower levels (around 50 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>Concerning CMCase activity, it was quite low (under 100 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> for the three insects), the variations of activity between initial point and point 7 days are dissimilar for the three insects. Indeed the activity increased from around 40&#x02013;60 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup> for cockroach gut microbiomes. For chafer, it increased from quasi inexistant activity to around 10 U&#x022c5;L<sup>-1</sup>.

The community structures of WSR shifted from microbiomes dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. Among these phyla, Bacteroidia and Clostridia classes became preponderant except for the Chafer, where the Clostridia were always dominant. Proteobacteria phyla tended to be less abundant after fermentation of wheat straw (WSR-SBR reactors) and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria class decreased.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Relative abundance of bacteria phylum <bold>(A)</bold> and bacteria class <bold>(B)</bold> identified from the Illumina Miseq sequencing data, within insect gut microbiomes before (T0) and after cultures in successive batch reactors maintained at pH8: duplicate WS-SBR-1 and WS-SR-2 were fed with wheat straw and BR-SBR contained insect gut without wheat straw among two successive batch.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-09-02222-g008"/></fig><p>As shown by the PCoA analysis (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref></bold>), the structure of the community greatly shifted compared to the initial inoculum during the first batch and then, the compositions of the bacterial community tended to be stable after WSR-SBR-1.

This work showed for the first time a comparison of insects-guts microbiomes from different order as inocula for fermentation of lignocellulose. This comparison was done in term of enzymatic activity, microbial diversity, production of metabolites and degradation of wheat straw. This work also highlights the technical difficulty of these comparisons.</p><p>The possibility to use directly their whole microbiome in anaerobic batch reactors to ferment wheat straw was explored. Starting from neutral pH, cockroach and beetle microbiomes exhibited the highest global enzyme activity. The highest lignocellulose conversion was attributed to chaffer and locust with a maximum of 5% of lignocellulose converted into metabolites. The microbial diversity and enzymatic activities revealed to be very different depending the insect microbiome considered even if similar degradation potentials were obtained. By selecting environmental conditions closest to the insect gut, it was possible to improve the degradation of lignocellulose at a maximum of 20%. The control of pH allowed a good stability of fermentative bacterial community structure for reactors inoculated with chafer and cockroach microbiomes. Unfortunately, it was not possible to maintain a stable degradation of lignocellulose along the different batches. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> experiments strongly modify the structure of microbial communities. Works remain to maintain the biological function in reactors in relation to the bacterial community structure.</p><p>However, the high diversity of insect microbiome and the ability of these microbiomes to cumulate hydrogen and acetate <italic>ex vivo</italic> in bioreactors showed the high potential of this system for biotechnological application.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AG and LC are students in this project, did all bioreactors&#x02019; experiments, insects selection and dissection, data interpretation, and drafted the manuscript.
