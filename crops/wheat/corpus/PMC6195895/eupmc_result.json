    "Development of low glycemic-foods is important in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. In this context, we prepared four test foods (TFs) (two mixed mini-meals and two breakfast items) with low glycemic-components and assessed their glycemic index (GI) in young healthy non-diabetic volunteers with mean age of 29 yr, body mass index of 24 kg/m2, and fasting plasma glucose levels less than 4.62 mmol/L. Volunteers were given 50 g of glucose, as a reference food (RF) on the first day, and TFs, i.e. TF1 (mixed mini meal: roti made of wheat flour and chana dal+ curd), TF2 [mixed mini meal made of wheat, pearl barley, and Bengal gram flour (besan) mix with chana whole (unhusked chana+curd)], TF3 (pearl barley rawa upma), and TF4 (wheat rawa upma) were given 2-day intervals in the same order. Glucose levels at fasting conditions and after the consumption of RF and TFs at different time intervals (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min) were measured, and the incremental area under curve (IAUC) for glucose and GI of the TFs were calculated. The glucose IAUC values at different time points were highest for TF2 (GI=71.9Â±7.4), while all other TFs had comparable GI in the range of 53.7~54.9. Among the various TFs, TF1, TF3, and TF4 exerted low to moderate glycemic response, and thus can be classified as low glycemic-foods. Nevertheless, these foods need to be tested for their efficacy in controlling and/or managing hyperglycemia and glucose over-load in diabetic subjects."
