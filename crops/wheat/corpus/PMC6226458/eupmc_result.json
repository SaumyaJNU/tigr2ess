    "Though the physical structuring of insoluble dietary fiber sources may strongly impact their processing by microbiota in the colon, relatively little mechanistic information exists to explain how these aspects affect microbial fiber fermentation. Here, we hypothesized that wheat bran fractions varying in size would be fermented differently by gut microbiota, which would lead to size-dependent differences in metabolic fate (as short-chain fatty acids; SCFAs) and community structure. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro fermentation assay in which wheat bran particles from a single source were separated by sieving into five size fractions and inoculated with fecal microbiota from three healthy donors. SCFA production, measured by gas chromatography, uncovered size fraction-dependent relationships between total SCFAs produced as well as the molar ratios of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that these size-dependent metabolic outcomes were accompanied by the development of divergent microbial community structures. We further linked these distinct results to subtle, size-dependent differences in chemical composition. These results suggest that physical context can drive differences in microbiota composition and function, that fiber-microbiota interaction studies should consider size as a variable, and that manipulating the size of insoluble fiber-containing particles might be used to control gut microbiome composition and metabolic output."
