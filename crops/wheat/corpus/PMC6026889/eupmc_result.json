    "Many studies throughout the world have shown positive responses of various crops to silicon (Si) application in terms of plant health, nutrient uptake, yield, and quality. Although not considered an essential element for plant growth, Si has been recently recognized as a \"beneficial substance\" or \"quasi-essential\" due to its important role in plant nutrition, especially notable under stressed conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of Si on wheat plant height, grain yield (GY), and grain protein content (GP). The experiment was conducted during two consecutive growing seasons in Idaho. A split-plot experimental design was used with three Si fertilization rates (140, 280, and 560 kg Si ha-1) corresponding to 100, 50, and 25% of manufacturer-recommended rates and two application times-at planting and tillering (Feekes 5). MontanaGrowTM (0-0-5) by MontanaGrow Inc. (Bonner, MT, USA) used in this study is a Si product sourced from a high-energy amorphous (non-crystalized) volcanic tuff. There was no significant effect of Si rate and application time on plant height, nutrient uptake, GY, or GP of irrigated winter wheat grown in non-stressed conditions. These results could be directly related to the Si fertilizer source used in the study. We are planning to further evaluate Si's effect on growth and grain production of wheat grown in non-stressed vs. stressed conditions utilizing several different Si sources and application methods."
