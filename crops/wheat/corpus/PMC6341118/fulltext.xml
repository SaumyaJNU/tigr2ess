However, the current trend of vaccine refusal and hesitancy, in part due to perceived potential hazards of parenteral vaccines and the aversion to needles, calls for the development of more friendly and efficient vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Mucosal vaccines provide painless and safe administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While the oral route would be the most convenient mucosal vaccination approach, the nature of the digestive system causes degradation of the ingested antigen by the low gastric pH and digestive enzymes of the small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Consequently, for oral immunization to be effective, protein antigens must be protected from the harsh environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT).</p><p id="Par4">The early-branching eukaryote <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> is perhaps the only protozoan capable of colonizing the lumen of the upper small intestine of many vertebrates, including humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>Giardia</italic> has a simple life cycle consisting of the intestinal flagellated trophozoite and the environmentally resistant cyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. How <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites can survive in the hostile milieu of the small intestine is unclear, but the <italic>Giardia</italic> surface is completely covered with molecules belonging to a family of cysteine-rich proteins called variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To evade the host immune responses, <italic>Giardia</italic> undergoes antigenic variation by continuously switching its VSPs generated from a repertoire of ~200 homologous genes present in the parasite genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Previously, we reported that a mechanism similar to RNA-interference (RNAi) ensures that only one VSP is expressed on the surface of <italic>Giardia</italic> at any time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. By knocking down key enzymes of the RNAi pathway, we generated trophozoites expressing their entire repertoire of VSPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, adjuvant-free oral administration of native VSPs purified from these altered trophozoites afforded efficient vaccination against <italic>Giardia</italic> without causing any symptoms of giardiasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This result indicated that VSPs remain stable and immunogenic after passage through the GIT environment and that they are not toxic to cells or animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">VSPs are integral membrane proteins consisting of an extracellular variable region rich in cysteine (mainly as CXXC motifs), a single hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The molecular mass of <italic>Giardia</italic> VSPs varies from 20 to 200&#x02009;kDa and the number of CXXC motifs depends on the length of the VSP extracellular region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Surface proteins with the VSP signature (protein family database PF03302) are also present in other parasitic protozoa such as <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> and <italic>E. dispar</italic>, which colonize the large intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and in the free-living ciliates <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>Giardia</italic> VSPs, or molecules sharing similar characteristics, could be responsible for protecting cells under stress conditions.</p><p id="Par6">It is well known that the most successful vaccines are attenuated or inactivated pathogen-based formulations; i.e., naturally occurring particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The importance of the particulate form of antigens for efficient vaccination was highlighted by the success of recombinant vaccines based on non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Retrovirus-derived VLPs offer a very versatile and efficient platform for vaccine formulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We previously showed that many heterologous antigens can be addressed at the surface of these VLPs by fusing their extracellular region with the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that protecting VLPs with VSPs could enable their use for efficient oral vaccination. To test this idea, antigens of the influenza virus, which enter the body through mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, were used as model antigens. Influenza are enveloped viruses in which hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for virus binding to sialic acid-containing molecules, being the main target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that protect against infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. HA can be efficiently pseudotyped onto retrovirus-derived VLPs and its co-expression with neuraminidase (NA) allows efficient VLP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">We here show that different VSPs are resistant to proteolytic digestion, fluctuations in pH and temperature and that they have an intrinsic adjuvant activity. When influenza antigens are included in VSP-pseudotyped VLPs, they produce a remarkable immune response against the flu antigens. Oral vaccination with those VLPs protects mice from live influenza virus challenges and from the development of tumors expressing the vaccinal antigen. These results demonstrate that by taking advantage of the properties of surface molecules of protozoan microorganisms oral vaccines can generate protective humoral and cellular immunity locally and at distant sites of the body.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Surface proteins containing CXXC motifs are highly resistant</title><p id="Par9">Regions of different <italic>Giardia</italic> VSPs and VSP-like molecules from <italic>E. histolytica</italic>, <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, and <italic>P. tetraurelia</italic> are shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.

The presence of these proteins on the surface of microorganisms living in harsh environments, characterized by changes of pH, temperature and redox potential as well as the presence of proteolytic enzymes, suggests that surface proteins containing multiple CXXC motifs play a key role in protecting cells under hostile conditions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Resistance to degradation of protozoan CXXC-rich proteins. <bold>a</bold> High magnification representative images of trophozoites from <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, and <italic>Paramecium tetraurelia</italic>, and non-adherent mammalian cell (NS0) incubated for 90&#x02009;min with high trypsin concentration (20&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

The extracellular cysteine-rich region of VSPs was preserved and the C-terminal transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic residues were replaced by a His<sub>6</sub> purification tag (&#x00394;VSPs). We first assessed the in vitro behavior of &#x00394;VSP1267 against conditions present in the GIT and observed its high resistance to extreme pH and proteolytic digestion by trypsin, intestinal and stomach extracts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). &#x00394;VSP9B10 and &#x00394;VSPH7 showed a similar behavior (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This resistance to proteolysis was identical to that observed in native VSPs from <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In contrast, heterologous antigens such the influenza virus surface protein HA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and the <italic>Giardia</italic> intracellular molecule GRP78/BiP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) showed high susceptibility to degradation, suggesting that the resistance observed in VSPs may depend on the presence of multiple CXXC motifs. For that reason, &#x00394;VSP1267 was treated with either reducing agents or metal chelators and subsequently confronted to trypsin.

Microbial PAMPs are recognized by the innate immune system through PRRs. PRRs on the surface of DCs, M cells and epithelial cells of the intestine are known to be important in antigen transcytosis and presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In this work, we observed that <italic>Giardia</italic> VSPs were able to signal through TLR-4 both in DCs and in a reporter cell line.

Thus, proteins containing multiple copies of the CXXC motif can be considered a novel PAMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Therefore, VSPs could be used not only to protect antigens from degradation but also to provide a desirable mucosal adjuvant effect.</p><p id="Par28">We investigated the use of VSPs in vaccine design using VLPs as a platform. The most widely used vaccines are based on attenuated or inactivated bacteria or viruses, emphasizing the importance of a particulate structure for proper immunization. Recombinant vaccines are safer than traditional vaccines, but are often less immunogenic and usually require multiple doses and effective adjuvants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. VLPs used for homologous vaccination are a highly effective subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure of virus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation of the immunogenic proteins without containing infectious genetic material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. VLPs also make excellent carrier molecules for the delivery of heterologous antigens because their particulate structure is readily taken up by antigen-presenting cells, and is thus able to prime long-lasting cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses in addition to antibody responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In addition, VLPs based on enveloped viruses, such as retrovirus-based VLPs, have the unique property of being able to express the envelope protein of heterologous viruses under their proper tertiary and even quaternary structures, thus ideal for the triggering of NAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">The ease of designing antigen-presenting VLPs offers a promising approach for the industrial production of vaccines against many diseases. VLPs have been produced in a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses, combining unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity as exemplified by the current vaccines against the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. On the other hand, although several routes of administration have been used in different vaccination trials with VLPs, including nasal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, intravaginal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, rectal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and oral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> routes, VLP vaccines that are available on the market have only been delivered parenterally, showing the same disadvantages that any other vaccine given by injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that harnessing VLP vaccines with VSPs could allow their oral administration while providing adjuvant properties. For this purpose, we used retrovirus-based VLPs, which allow efficient generation of NAbs, as demonstrated for a variety of antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Retrovirus-based VLPs expressing heterologous antigens have already been produced for clinical trials, demonstrating the ability to be manufactured with yields and purity that are expected to be suitable for vaccine production at a commercial scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">As a proof of concept, we used antigens from influenza virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We designed and produced enveloped chimeric VLPs that co-express VSPs and the main influenza virus antigens on their membrane. Remarkably, VSP expression protected HA from the action of proteolytic enzymes and intestinal and stomach extracts. Previously, protection of membrane molecules in trans was observed only during <italic>Giardia</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Protection of HA on the surface of VSP-pseudotyped VLPs is the first demonstration that such effect can be generated artificially and translated to other membranes. How VSPs protect heterologous antigens is still an open question. However, we have shown that (a) the heterologous antigens must be present on the same particles that express the VSP-G, (b) NA and HA are exposed on the surface of VLPs since NA is accessible to its substrate and HA retains its hemagglutinating activity, (c) HA and VSP are exposed because they are detected on the surface of VLPs by immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy, and (d) VSPs do not act as protease inhibitors. All these results suggest that the heterologous antigens are not directly shielded by VSP-G molecules on the surface of the VLPs. Therefore, we hypothesize that intra- and intermolecular interactions among these proteins, likely involving metal and disulfide bridges, play crucial roles in antigen protection. Indeed, when VSPs are treated with metal chelators or reducing agents their protective properties are lost. Nevertheless, the completion of the high-resolution structures of &#x00394;VSP and &#x00394;VSP-antigen complexes, which has been elusive until now, will allow a better understanding of the mechanism by which VSPs interact and protect heterologous antigens from the action of proteolytic enzymes.</p><p id="Par31">VSPs not only protected HA from degradation but also enhanced the in vitro immunogenic properties of VLP-HA. Particle binding and uptake, up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules as well as secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 by DCs were improved in VSP-pseudotyped VLPs with respect to plain VLPs. Production of cytokines by DCs is crucial in modulating immune responses generated through microbial products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. TNF-&#x003b1; is an important pleiotropic cytokine involved in host defense and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

The adjuvant effects of VSP-pseudotyped VLPs were TLR-4 dependent since they were abolished when DCs from TLR-4 KO mice were used.

When mice were orally immunized with HA-expressing VLPs, without added adjuvants, a strong cellular and antibody response was generated with VLP-HA/VSP-G, but not with plain VLPs. These results indicate that VSP pseudotyping was necessary to protect and adjuvant VLPs to generate a humoral response that not only is present in serum but also prevails in mucosal fluids, which are the first barrier encountered by infectious agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">The gut is also a site for mucosal tolerance induction, as occurs with food antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.
