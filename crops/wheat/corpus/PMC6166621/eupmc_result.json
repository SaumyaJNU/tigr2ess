    "Improving photosynthetic capacity significantly affects the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in rainfed regions. In this study, the physiological characteristics of eight large-spike wheat lines were compared with a multiple-spike cultivar as a control (CK) in a field over two consecutive seasons: 2010-2012. The tillering peak was 7-21 d after returning green for line 2040, the average rate of decline of relative water content was slower, and the average duration time of photosynthetic rate was longer than CK in vitro. There was a strong linear and positive correlation between photosynthetic rate and root activity at jointing, flowering, and grain-filling stages. In addition, average yields were higher in large-spike lines than CK (multiple-spike cultivar). The results suggest that large-spike lines might have greater water retaining capacity during yield formation under rainfed conditions."
