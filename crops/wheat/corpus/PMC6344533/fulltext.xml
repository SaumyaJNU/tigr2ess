Diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer&#x02019;s, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after 3 months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, both taxonomic and functional profiles were established. Here we report that alpha diversity is not changed significantly during the diet, but differences in both taxonomic and functional composition are detected. Relative abundance of bifidobacteria as well as <italic>E. rectale</italic> and <italic>Dialister</italic> is significantly diminished during the intervention. An increase in relative abundance of <italic>E. coli</italic> is observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicates that bifidobacteria and <italic>Escherichia</italic> are important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As relative abundance of health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria becomes less abundant during KD, we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Gut&#x02013;brain axis: The ketogenic diet alters functional gut microbiota</title><p id="Par2">The ketogenic diet changes both the relative abundance of gut microbiota and their metabolic activities.

Dysbiosis, disturbances in the gut microbiome, has been linked to neurological disorders, such as autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> anxiety, and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> via the &#x0201c;microbiome&#x02013;gut&#x02013;brain axis.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> This axis is a bidirectional communication system between the intestinal microbiome and the central nervous system involving neural, endocrine, and immune pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> As evidence of this, germ-free mice display deficits in brain development and behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Diet influences the composition of the human gut microbiome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Based on the anti-seizure effect of fasting, the ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, adequate-protein, very low-carbohydrate diet, was developed in the early 1920s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> to mirror the key metabolic effects of fasting. A diet very high in fat and low in carbohydrates induces multiple changes in the intermediary metabolism and results in the use of ketones as the main energy substrate. In children, KD is used in the treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy and in neurometabolic disorders where glucose is not fully available as an energy substrate such as glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. A seizure reduction of &#x0003e;50% has been found in about half of the treated children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Today, the classic KD is calculated with a ratio between 2:1 and 4:1 of fat to protein and carbohydrates combined. The ratio 4:1 contains 4 parts of fat and 1 part of proteins and carbohydrates together (in g). With a 4:1 ratio, 70&#x02013;90% of energy intake is derived from fat. Despite a long history of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying the seizure-suppressive action are unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed including changes in neurotransmitter systems, inhibitory action of polyunsaturated fatty acids, or enhancement of mitochondrial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Different aspects of human metabolism may be implicated, but little is known about how KD influences our &#x0201c;second genome,&#x0201d; the microbiome.

KD intervention did not have any overall significant impact on the relative abundance of any of these pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5 a, b</xref> and Fig. Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2 a, b</xref>). Interestingly though, we found that genes from the most abundant butyrate-producing pathway in the healthy human gut microbiome, the acetyl-CoA pathway, were less abundant in our patients compared to controls already before starting KD. Here a very weak but inverse correlation was detected between age of the patients and relative gene abundance indicating that the lower relative abundance of genes of the acetyl-CoA pathway in our patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) compared to our controls before KD was not due to the age difference between both groups. Rather, increasing age in our patients might increase the difference to the controls. An opposite trend was shown for the 4-aminobutyrate pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). This pathway was shown to be less relative abundant in the healthy gut microbiome compared to the acetyl-CoA pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> In our cohort, genes of this pathway were more frequently identified in patients compared to controls before KD and a possible, yet not significant, further proportional increase was experienced during KD. Relative gene abundance seemed to slightly increase with age of the patients, indicating that this observation cannot be explained by age differences in the patient and control groups either. The lysine pathway did not show any significant differences in relative gene abundances within or between the groups at either time point (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). In the glutarate pathway, the relative abundance of one out of the six genes (<italic>hgCoAdA</italic>) was significantly decreased in the patients (Supplementary Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). However, the relative abundance of the concomitant enzymatic subunits <italic>hgCoAdB</italic> and <italic>hgCoAdC</italic> or other genes involved in this pathway was not decreased.

However, we are aware of some weaknesses of our study. Owing to the small size of this pilot cohort (12 patients and 11 controls), we are continuing to recruit patients for a larger study, in which we aim to stratify responders from the non-responders to identify differences in their gut microbiota. Another weakness is the heterogeneity of this epilepsy cohort in which different etiologies were included, and in one third of patients, despite thorough investigations including genetics, a specific etiology could not be obtained. Also the study lacks age-matched controls. Enrollment of healthy children proved difficult, but parents of our patients, sharing the same household, agreed to participate. Even though none of the parents started KD for themselves, they may have changed their dietary habits to some extent, i.e., eating less sugar and more fat. This might explain the decrease in Actinobacteria relative abundance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which, however, was not statistically significant. Apart from that, the microbiome of the parents was more stable comparing time point one and two and none of the taxa or pathways found significantly changed owing to KD in patients were found in parents. Importantly, as we aimed to study the effect of KD on the gut microbiota we compare communities and function before versus 3 months after starting KD within the patient group.</p><p id="Par31">Here we show that the fecal microbiome of children with epilepsy changes during KD. The compositional changes observed might not be favorable for gut or overall health based on the current understanding of the composition and role of a healthy gut microbiota. Taxa believed to be health promoting (bifidobacteria and <italic>E. rectale</italic>) decrease in relative abundance and with them their health-promoting metabolites. One hypothesis for the mechanism of action of KD is the restriction of glucose production from dietary carbohydrates and production of ketone bodies from fat as alternative energy sources. While simple dietary sugars highly abundant in a modern Western diet are readily absorbed in the small intestine and contribute to elevated blood glucose levels, complex, so-called non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) cannot be hydrolyzed by the human enzyme repertoire and reach the large intestine. Several studies have shown the important role of dietary fibers/NDCs as energy sources for gut microbes in order to maintain gut health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> Thus supplementing patients on KD with such fibers might seem advisable. The prebiotics inulin, lactulose, FOS, and galacto-oligosaccharides have been investigated in several human trials, and studies suggest that these carbohydrates preferentially increase bifidobacteria and decrease <italic>E. coli</italic> and enterococci.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> This might prevent undesired changes in the gut microbiota in our patients. However, we first need to understand the role that changes in the gut microbiota during KD play in its therapeutic effect. Olson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> elegantly showed that a gut microbiota was necessary for the anti-seizure effect of KD in mice.

Identifying which microbial taxa and functions may be correlated to a positive effect of the diet in patients could lead to the development of probiotic supplements for non-responders to increase their chance of response to the intervention. Ideally, KD could even be replaced by the right combination of prebiotic and probiotic supplements or FMTs in the future. A larger cohort is needed to further investigate this. Additionally, while our cohort suffered from therapy-resistant epilepsy, KD has also been shown to be effective in many other diseases, such as cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> multiple sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> Alzheimer&#x02019;s and Parkinson&#x02019;s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> depression, autism, and type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> Thus our results may have implications for a wide range of serious health concerns.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Patient cohort</title><p id="Par32">The present study was performed at the Neuropediatric Department, Astrid Lindgren Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Karolinska Hospital. The patients were enrolled consecutively as they attended the Neuropediatric Outpatient Clinic and a decision was made to start KD. The inclusion criteria were: age 2&#x02013;17 years; therapy-resistant inoperable epilepsy or a diagnosis of a neurometabolic disorder in which KD is recommended, no medical contraindications to a trial with KD, and consent for fecal sampling. Exclusion criteria were antibiotics taken within 3 months before starting KD.</p><p id="Par33">The cohort included 12 children starting KD. Eleven suffered from therapy-resistant epilepsy and one had a neurometabolic disorder, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. The latter patient also had epilepsy but seizures were infrequent. For demographics, see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Four were males and eight females. Their age at diet start were 7.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.5 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) years. The mean age at seizure start was 2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.1 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) years, (range 0.1&#x02013;5.8). The types of seizures were classified according to the revised terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy classifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> The majority of children had more than one seizure type. Etiology could be determined in eight cases. In four patients, genetic mutations had been verified. The cohort had previously been on treatment with a mean of 5.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), range 1&#x02013;9. At the time of KD start, the children were all on daily AED treatment. They were treated with mean 1.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8 (&#x000b1;SD), range 1&#x02013;3 AEDs at diet start. At 3 months on KD, when follow-up of efficacy and second sampling of fecal microbiota was made, all had the same AEDs and dosing as before diet start except for two patients. One had tapered lacosamid soon after diet start (a non-responder) and the other had a slight increase in clobazam dose (a non-responder). Eleven children had been investigated with neuropsychological formal testing methods concerning intellectual ability. Nine patients were diagnosed with intellectual disability (ID) ranging from mild to severe. One child was found to have learning disability and attention problems but no diagnosis was made, one child was late in development and not yet tested, and one child was clinically not found to have any deficits. Other comorbidities as autism spectrum disorder, attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cerebral palsy were also common. Nine patients were fed orally and three patients had a gastrostomy.</p><p id="Par34">Parents of the children included in the cohort acted as controls (one parent per child). The controls had a normal dietary intake with a western diet and no one had any specific diets. They did not make any substantial changes in their diet during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par35">Seizure frequency was determined from seizure calendars in which parents and other caregivers made daily notes of the number and type(s) of seizures. They made notes during the month before KD and during KD. Calculations of these notes were used to define seizure response. Mean seizure frequency the month before starting KD was compared with mean seizure frequency the month before follow-up. Children with &#x0003c;50% seizure reduction were classified as non-responders and those with &#x0003e;50% seizure reduction as responders. Evaluation of cognitive and motor function was based on observations made by the parents and caregivers. They answered a questionnaire before diet start and at 3-month follow-up concerning the level of their child&#x02019;s alertness, social interest and interaction, verbal responsiveness, ability to communicate, and motor function. Cognitive and motor function was considered improved if clear positive changes were experienced.</p><p id="Par36">We followed a standardized protocol for the classic KD, which is a slightly modified version of the protocol of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> A dietitian specially trained to carry out KD treatment calculated total calorie level per day and composition of meals and supplements for each individual. These calculations were based on a 2-day diary kept by the parents before admission in which they recorded all food consumed by the child as well as discussions with the parents on the child&#x02019;s food preferences. We did not use fasting or calorie restriction. A minimum of 1&#x02009;g/kg body weight per day of protein was used. The children were supplemented with multivitamins and minerals, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and carnitine. Potassium citrate was used to reduce the risk of kidney stones.</p><p id="Par37">KD was started on a ratio of 2:1. This ratio was increased weekly in half steps, i.e., after 1 week of 2:1, it was increased to 2.5:1. Usually an optimal ratio for the individual was reached in 3&#x02013;6 weeks. This ratio was kept unchanged until 3 months after start when KD was evaluated concerning efficacy and the second fecal sample was taken.</p><p id="Par38">To initiate the treatment, the child was hospitalized for 4 days. Before starting KD, a venous blood sample was obtained in the first morning before breakfast for analyses of glucose and the ketone &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyric acid. Fecal samples were obtained by a swab from the diaper or toilet paper. During the stay, KD was introduced and controlled by clinical examinations and daily blood levels of glucose, &#x003b2;-OHB, and acid&#x02013;base balance. Keto diet school to teach parents, relatives, and caregivers on various aspects of the diet was carried out.
