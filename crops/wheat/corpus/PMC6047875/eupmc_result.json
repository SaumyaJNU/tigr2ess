    "In this study, we investigated the changes in quality and antioxidant activity of sugar-snap cookies prepared with different blends of refined wheat (WHF) and oat flour (OAF). The crude protein contents of OAF and WHF were 12.24% and 7.17%, respectively, and the fiber contents of were 3.45% and 0.31%, respectively; both were increased by adding OAF. However, the total starch contents were decreased by adding OAF. The Î²-glucan content of the samples increased considerably upon the addition of OAF. The water-holding capacity was increased after adding OAF compared to WHF (79.21%). Water binding in wet gluten contents decreased on the addition of OAF. Final viscosity increased on the addition of OAF. Antioxidant activity and total phenolic acid were increased upon the addition of OAF. The thickness of cookies prepared with OAF, WHF, 20% of WHF with OAF (WOB20), and WOB40 were 11.28, 12.35, 9.74, and 9.81 mm, respectively. The hardness of cookies prepared with WHF and WOF20 did not differ significantly, and analysis of the appearance of cookies showed that the cookies were increasingly cracked as the OAF content increased. Therefore, substituting WHF with OAF improved the quality and nutrient value of the cookies."
