    "The dataset presented here profiles oxidative modification of mRNAs in wheat seeds in response to after-ripening, a treatment that releases seeds from the state of dormancy. The level of dormancy in wheat seeds is closely associated with preharvest sprouting, defined as the germination of seeds while they are on the mother plant, which negatively affects wheat yield and quality. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of seed dormancy is critical for improving the tolerance of wheat seeds to preharvest sprouting. The dataset were generated using oxidized mRNA samples derived from three independent biological replicates of dormant and after-ripened (non-dormant) wheat seeds and a microarray based experimental procedures that involved the use of Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array. The raw and normalized data are available in NCBI×³s Gene Expression Ominbus (GEO) database with accession number GSE41949, and a related research article has been published in Plant Biotechnology Journal (Gao et al., 2013)."
