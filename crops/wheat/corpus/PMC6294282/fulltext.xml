Neonicotinoid seed treatments and foliar application of insecticides are two common methods to control aphid infestations and reduce BYD. An analysis was carried out across 33 insecticide efficacy tests performed in west Tennessee during the last 11 yr to determine how insecticide seed treatments and/or a late-winter foliar insecticide application affected aphid populations, incidence of BYD, and yield. A significant decrease in springtime aphid populations and incidence of BYD was observed when using a seed treatment, a foliar insecticide application, or both. Average wheat yields were increased by 280&#x02013;381 kg/ha (5.3&#x02013;7.2%) if an insecticide seed treatment was used or when a foliar insecticide application was made. Compared with insecticide seed treatments, average springtime aphid populations and the incidence of BYD were lower when a foliar insecticide was applied. A foliar insecticide application made in addition to insecticide seed treatments increased yield by an average of 196 kg/ha (3.4%). The yield increases over the nontreated control suggest that wheat growers in west Tennessee can use insecticides to manage aphids and prevent transmission of BYD. Consideration of environmental conditions, whether or not insecticide seed treatments were used, and scouting can be used to help make decisions on when or if to apply foliar insecticides.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>soft red winter wheat</kwd><kwd><italic>Triticum aestivium</italic> L</kwd><kwd>aphid</kwd><kwd>barley yellow dwarf virus</kwd><kwd>insecticide control</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>World wheat (<italic>Triticum</italic> spp.) production is estimated at over 221 million ha, which makes it the most widely cultivated crop (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">USDA 2016</xref>). In Tennessee, wheat production varies considerably, but typically ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 ha of soft red winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivium</italic> L.), which is typically planted in the fall (September&#x02013;November) and harvested in June. The majority of Tennessee&#x02019;s wheat is grown in west and middle Tennessee. Producers in the midsouthern and southeastern United States typically grow wheat in a double-crop system where wheat harvest is followed with planting of soybeans (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.) or another summer crop. In 2017, the average wheat yield in Tennessee was 4,764 kg/ha (70 bu/acre; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">USDA-NASS 2016</xref>), and over the last 10 yr, average yield has ranged from 4,967 to 3,403 kg/ha (50&#x02013;73 bu/acre).</p><p>Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) are a threat to wheat production not only by feeding on the plant and causing yield loss, but also by transmitting barley yellow dwarf (BYD) virus (Family Luteoviridae). BYD virus within the host plant is phloem limited and cannot be transmitted without the assistance of aphids (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Gildow 1987</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and D&#x02019;Arcy 1995</xref>). Several aphid species may infest wheat and have been shown to transmit BYD, including the bird cherry-oat aphid, <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae); greenbug, <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> (Rondani) (Hemiptera: Aphididae); English grain aphid, <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic> (F.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae); and corn leaf aphid, <italic>Rhopalosiphum maidis</italic> (Fitch) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">McPherson and Brann 1983</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Hershman 1996</xref>).</p><p>BYD is the most common and widespread disease of wheat and cereal crops worldwide (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al. 2000</xref>). BYD is a worldwide economic problem not only for wheat but also for other cereal grains, causing loss in yield and grain quality by stunting shoot and root growth (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Plumb 1983</xref>). The magnitude of crop damage by aphids depends on the extent of infestation (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Kieckhefer et al. 1995</xref>), timing of infestation (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Kieckhefer and Gellner 1988</xref>), plant growth stage at time of infestation (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Pike and Schaffner 1985</xref>), and whether or not BYD is successfully transmitted to the host (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">McPherson et al. 1986</xref>). In North America, the most serious BYD outbreaks have primarily been associated with fall transmission by the bird cherry-oat aphid (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Halbert and Pike 1985</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al. 1986</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Araya et al. 1987</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Halbert et al. 1992</xref>). Observations in Tennessee suggest that overwintering aphids and their offspring also transmit BYD during the late winter months, which also results in yield loss (S.D.S., personal communication).</p><p>Symptomology of BYD infection includes orange, red, or purple leaf discoloration, especially at the leaf tips (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">McKirdy and Jones 1996</xref>). A consistent indicator of BYD in Tennessee is an observable pink to reddish discoloration of leaf tips, especially during the spring. Reported yield loss associated with BYD in wheat has been variable. <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kieckhefer and Kantack (1988)</xref> reported that high aphid populations can directly reduce yield up to 50%. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al. (1990)</xref> reported typical yield losses from BYD range from 2 to 10% in the United States. However, another study demonstrated that BYD could reduce wheat yield by 46%, and yield loss was 58% when infested with bird cherry-oat aphids (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Riedell et al. 1961</xref>). A different study demonstrated that wheat yield could be decreased by 34% when infected with BYD virus (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Herbert et al. 1999</xref>).</p><p>Aphids and BYD are managed most effectively by implementing an integrated pest management approach including region appropriate planting dates and use of tolerant varieties to BYD. Insecticides are commonly used to control aphid populations in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Hays et al. 1999</xref>). Neonicotinoid seed treatments such as Gaucho (imidacloprid, Bayer CropScience, Raleigh, NC), Cruiser (thiamethoxam, Syngenta Crop Protection, Greensboro, NC), Poncho (clothianidin, Bayer CropScience), and NipsIt Inside (clothianidin, Valent, Walnut Creek, CA) are a recommended control method for the management of aphids and BYD (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Stewart and McClure 2017</xref>). If insecticide seed treatments are not used, a foliar chemical application 30 d after planting and/or in late winter may reduce aphid populations and the incidence of BYD (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Buntin 2007</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Design</title><p>An analysis was performed across 33 experiments in west Tennessee from 2006 to 2017 to evaluate the impact of insecticide seed treatments and foliar insecticide applications on aphid infestations, incidence of BYD, and yield (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Not all experiments contained both treatment factors, and neither did they all have complete, balanced data of treatment effects on aphid populations, incidence of BYD, or yield. All experiments except one were performed at the West Tennessee Research and Education Center in Jackson. Tests were both small plot and large plot, and all were arranged in a randomized complete block design. Individual plots in small-plot tests were 1.5 m wide by 9 m long. Plots in large-plot tests were 7.7 m wide and ranged between 30.5 and 300 m long. Planting dates ranged from late September until late November, with the median planting date of approximately 17 October. All tests were planted at a target seeding rate of 2.5&#x02013;3.0 million seeds/ha and a row spacing of 19 cm. Average planting depth was 2.5&#x02013;3.8 cm. Although several varieties were used during the 11-yr period, P26R10 or P26R22 (Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., Johnston, IA) was used in the majority of these experiments. These varieties are commonly planted in the region and are midrange in their sensitivity to BYD based on evaluations made in Tennessee (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Wheat was fertilized and managed for weeds based on standard recommendations made by the University of Tennessee (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Main et al. 2008</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1"

In each test, a single variety was planted (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only seed treatments tested at rates labeled for aphid control were included in the analyses. If an experiment contained a foliar insecticide application, a single treatment was applied between 31 January and 25 February. Karate Z at a rate of 27.3 g ai/ha (lambda-cyhalothrin, Syngenta Crop Protection) was normally used, but Baythroid XL at a rate of 13.2 g ai/ha (beta-cyfluthrin, Bayer CropScience) was used in some tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Aphid counts were taken as numbers per 0.91&#x02013;1.52 m of row (3&#x02013;5 row ft). Counts were often taken at various times throughout the fall and spring, but assessments were consistently made in March approximately 30 d after any springtime foliar insecticide application and these data were used in these analyses. Ratings on the incidence of BYD were subsequently made between Feekes stage 8 (just before boot) to 10.5 (flowering) by counting the number of flag leaves showing distinct symptoms of BYD, primarily characterized by reddish or pink coloration on the leaf tips, in the entire plot (small plot) or in an area ranging from 9.3 to 13.9 m<sup>2</sup> (large plots; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Wise et al. 2011</xref>). Timing of this rating was based on the optimum occurrence of symptomology as judged by the researcher. For small-plot experiments, whole-plot yield data were collected using a research-grade plot combine. A yield monitor was used in large-plot tests, but only the center 4.6 m of each plot was harvested.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Matching aphid counts, BYD ratings, and yield were not collected on all tests (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we only made comparisons among tests that were balanced in respect to data on aphid numbers, incidence of BYD, or yield when evaluating treatment effects. Response variables reported include spring aphid densities (numbers/row m), frequency of leaves showing BYD symptomology (numbers/10 m<sup>2</sup>), and yield (kg/ha). We did not attempt to compare the efficacy of different insecticide seed treatments, in part because rates varied both within and between tests. Data were analyzed using Proc GLIMMIX (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using a protected LSMEANS for detection of main effects (&#x003b1; = 0.05). Similar to the approach of <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">North (2016)</xref>, treatment factors were fixed effects within the model with test, replicate, and replicates nested with test considered random effects, thus helping to make inferences across a wide range of environments (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Carmer et al. 1989</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Blouin et al. 2011</xref>). Log transformations were performed on aphid and BYD numbers prior to analyses to satisfy the assumptions for analysis of variance. We also present data on the frequency that significant (&#x003b1; = 0.05) treatment responses were observed in individual tests based on standard analysis of variance methods (Proc GLIMMIX, LSMEANS). The cost of neonicotinoid seed treatments varies between $24.70 and $37.10/ha assuming a seedling rate of 134 kg/ha (2 bu/acre), whereas the costs of a foliar insecticide application varies from $11.10 to $18.60/ha with the range depending mostly on application costs (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2017</xref> and personal communication with local retailers).

Because aphid counts were taken in the spring, relatively soon after the foliar insecticide application, it is not surprising that aphid counts were relatively low compared with insecticide seed treatments. However, there was opportunity for aphid transmission of BYD before the foliar insecticide application. Thus, aphid densities may not fully reflect the benefits of insecticide seed treatments in protecting wheat yields. Counts of aphids were only occasionally made during the fall because infestations are generally low, averaging about 4.2 aphids/m in plots not treated with insecticides across tests, thus making it difficult to separate treatment differences. However, the use of an insecticide seed treatment reduced aphid densities in the spring by an average of 86%, similar to the 78% reduction of aphid numbers observed in the more limited number of fall samples. This suggests that colonization of aphids during the fall and/or early winter months is parental source of springtime aphid infestations in Tennessee, as it is unlikely that insecticide seed treatments provide residual control past the winter months.</p><p>This summary of experiments in Tennessee demonstrates that the management of aphid infestations in wheat increased yields by about 5&#x02013;10% depending on the insecticide treatment regime. On average, where direct comparisons were made, a late-winter foliar application reduced aphid numbers and the incidence of BYD more than insecticide seed treatments alone. The average yields of wheat treated with a foliar insecticide were 170 kg/ha higher than where only a seed treatment was used. Applying a late-winter foliar insecticide application in addition to insecticide seed treatments provided a similar yield increase (averaging 196 kg/ha) compared with only using a foliar application alone, and there were several individual tests where this increase was statistically significant.</p><p>Presumably yields were protected because insecticides reduced the incidence of BYD rather than the direct benefits of aphid control or other pests that may have been present. Aphid populations generally did not reach economically damaging levels apart from BYD infection in these tests. It is possible that seed treatments and foliar insecticides were controlling other pests and therefore affecting yield results. Neonicotinoid seed treatments are labeled for control of Hessian fly, <italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic> (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), although at rates higher than those typically used in our tests, and foliar pyrethroid insecticide may also affect this pest (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Flanders et al. 2013</xref>). The most common variety used in our tests, P26R10, has shown good resistance to Hessian fly. However, another variety we commonly used, P26R22, has low resistance to Hessian flies (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Noland et al. 2017</xref>). Application of insecticides could also potentially affect other pests such as cereal leaf beetles, <italic>Oulema melanopus</italic> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), or armyworm, <italic>Mythimna unipuncta</italic> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Cereal leaf beetles and armyworms are rarely observed in Tennessee wheat fields until March or later, but the impact of our treatments on these pests was not assessed. However, economically damaging infestations of these other pests were not apparent.</p><p>Climate ultimately influences the occurrence of aphids, and thus BYD, in wheat. <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Perry et al. (2000)</xref> reported that environmental factors and the strain of BYD influence yield reductions of small grains. <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bockus et al. (2015)</xref> found the greatest economic losses occurred when plants are infested with viruliferous cereal aphids at early leaf development stages. Our data indicates that some aphids survive the winter in Tennessee, serving as the parents of springtime aphid populations. Unlike more northern geographies, aphid survival during the winter probably increases the risk of BYD transmission during warm winter days when wheat is essentially dormant. Thus, results in Tennessee are almost certainly not applicable to all geographies and are only directly relevant to those growing winter wheat.</p><p>The range of planting dates in our experiments reflects local production practices. If growers plant before the recommended planting window (October 15, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Stewart and McClure 2017</xref>), they would probably increase the risk of infection with BYD, and early planted wheat may benefit more from the use of an insecticide seed treatment. The University of Tennessee&#x02019;s current recommendations for the management of aphids and BYD state that if a seed treatment is not used, a foliar insecticide application during the fall (approximately 30 d after planting) and/or late winter (prior to March) may also reduce BYD (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Stewart and McClure 2017</xref>). These recommendations also suggest that insecticide applications should be made before aphid populations exceed 6&#x02013;8/row ft; otherwise, any BYD transmission may have already occurred.</p><p>Our data would generally support these recommendations. In practice, pest managers are coached to scout for aphid infestations in the fall and treat if aphids are found in sufficient numbers (&#x0003e;3/row ft, S.D.S., personal communication). If aphid infestation remains low, as often occurs during years with cool falls or when wheat is late planted, growers are encouraged to delay any applications until late winter, typically January or February. Other areas in the South also promote fall and/or late-winter applications of insecticide to control aphids and BYD. For example, The University of Kentucky recommends a foliar insecticide application 30 d post-emergence when numbers exceed 9.8 aphids per row meter (3/row ft) and from 30 to 60 d post-emergence when counts exceed 19.7 aphid per row meter (6/row ft; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Townsend 1999</xref>). Similarly, the University of Georgia&#x02019;s recommendations discuss the potential benefits of both seed treatments and foliar insecticide application to prevent BYD, and they suggest different timings of a foliar application based on geographic location within the state (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Noland et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, these recommendations suggest managing BYD may be more valuable in the northern parts of Georgia. Implicit in these recommendations is that managing aphid infestations and BYD may be less beneficial in warmer climates where aphid colonization may continue over a longer period of time.</p><p>Assuming the most expensive treatment option of insecticide seed treatments ($37/ha) and an approximate yield response to this treatment of 300 kg/ha, expected economic returns would be $6.50/ha at a relatively modest commodity price of $147 per metric ton ($4/bu). The economic returns for a foliar application would be nearly three times higher considering insecticide and application costs ($11.10&#x02013;18.60/ha) are approximately one-half that of insecticide seed treatments. Based on our average results, a positive return of investment would be made by making a foliar insecticide application even when insecticide seed treatments were used because yields were increased by an average of 196 kg/ha when this application was made. It should be considered that a foliar application in the fall, or a fall and late-winter application, may offer similar or better economic returns than insecticide seed treatments. This is particularly true if these foliar applications can be coapplied with herbicides or foliar fertilizer applications, thus reducing application costs. Resistance or tolerance to aphids and BYD varies among wheat varieties (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Irwin and Thresh 1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Wolf et al. 2017</xref>), and the economic benefits of managing aphids with insecticides may vary depending on the variety grown. The two varieties most commonly used in our tests were moderately susceptible to BYD based on ratings of symptomology in variety trials performed in Tennessee (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thus, our results are probably representative of a &#x02018;typical&#x02019; variety, but more research is needed to fully define how variety selection affects the value of aphid and BYD management in wheat.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Bayer CropScience and Syngenta for providing insecticides used in these evaluations.
