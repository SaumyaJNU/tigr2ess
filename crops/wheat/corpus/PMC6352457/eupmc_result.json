    "Background:Understanding genetic diversity of wild plant germplasm and the relationships between ecogeographic and genetic characteristics may provide insights for better utilizing and conserving genetic resources. Elymus tangutorum (Nevski) Hand.-Mazz, a cool-season hexaploid perennial, is an important pasture bunchgrass species used for forages and grassland restoration in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and northwest China. In this study, 27 E. tangutorum accessions from diverse origins of western China were evaluated using AFLP markers in an effort to delve into the genetic relationships among them. The effects of eco-environmental factors and geographical isolation on the genetic diversity and population structure were also elucidated. Results:On account of 554 polymorphic fragments amplified with 14 primer combinations, the mean values of some marker parameters including polymorphic information content, resolving power and marker index were 0.2504, 14.10 and 23.07, respectively, validating the high efficiency and reliability of the markers selected. Genetic dissimilarity index values among accessions ranged from 0.1024 to 0.7137 with a mean of 0.2773. STRUCTURE, UPGMA clustering and PCoA analyses showed that all accessions could be divided into the three main clusters; however, this results do not exactly coincide with geographic groups. We found medium differentiation (F ST  = 0.162) between Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and Xinjiang (XJC), and high differentiation (F ST  = 0.188) among three Bayesian subgroups. A significant correlation (r = 0.312) between genetic and geographical distance was observed by Mantel test in the species level, while the weak correlation was detected between genetic and environmental distance for all accessions and most of geographical groups. In addition, a significant ecological influence of average annual precipitation on genetic distance was revealed in XJC group and the Bayesian subgroup A. Conclusion:This study indicates that AFLP technique are a useful tool to measure genetic diversity in E. tangutorum, showing that geographical and environmental factors (especially precipitation) together, play a crucial role in genetic differentiation patterns. These findings underline the importance of local adaptation in shaping patterns of genetic variability and population structure in E. tangutorum germplasm collected in Western China."
