However, the effects of reducing gluten-rich food items including wheat, barley and rye cereals in healthy adults are unclear. Here, we undertook a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial involving 60 middle-aged Danish adults without known disorders with two 8-week interventions comparing a low-gluten diet (2&#x02009;g gluten per day) and a high-gluten diet (18&#x02009;g gluten per day), separated by a washout period of at least six weeks with habitual diet (12&#x02009;g gluten per day). We find that, in comparison with a high-gluten diet, a low-gluten diet induces moderate changes in the intestinal microbiome, reduces fasting and postprandial hydrogen exhalation, and leads to improvements in self-reported bloating. These observations suggest that most of the effects of a low-gluten diet in non-coeliac adults may be driven by qualitative changes in dietary fibres.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Gluten-free diets are increasingly common in the general population.

Although not the sole component changed in a low-gluten diet, most discussion has centred on the dietary component gluten. Gluten is a major dietary component in wheat, rye and barley, and consists of proteins that are partially resistant to proteolytic digestion due to a high content of proline and glutamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Large gluten peptides including gliadin escape gastric digestion and accumulate in the small intestine, where they may interact with the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, affect the intestinal permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and modify the gut microbial activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, beyond the reduction in gluten, a low-gluten dietary regime also entails a replacement of dietary fibres of gluten-rich cereals such as wheat, rye and barley with dietary fibres from other sources. Two short-term studies enroling 10 and 21 subjects based upon 16S rRNA gene profiling, respectively, have suggested that a gluten-free diet (GFD) changes the gut microbiome and immune function in healthy adults, however, with discrepant results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, it remains unsettled if a low-gluten diet affects the taxonomic and functional microbiome and host physiology of healthy individuals.

Importantly, there was no difference between the two diet regimens in intake of total dietary fibre content.

We identified 88 KOs and 37 modules that changed following the low-gluten diet period compared with the high-gluten diet intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>; FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, linear mixed model). In particular, the abundance of modules associated with carbohydrate metabolism (i.e. arabinose degradation, pentose phosphate pathway, phosphate acetyltransferase-acetate kinase pathway and fructose-6-phosphate shunt) and uptake of carbohydrates (L-arabinose/lactose transport system, phosphotransferase systems (PTS) and other sugar transport systems) was diminished following the low-gluten dieting compared with the high-gluten dieting. This suggests a change in bacterial carbohydrate degradation as a response to the dietary intervention. Furthermore, abundance of modules associated with bacterial transport of glutamate, zinc/manganese and sulphate was diminished, whereas abundance of modules associated with transport of cysteine and iron was increased following the low-gluten diet compared with the high-gluten diet period. A majority of the modules showed subtle changes in the functional potential (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>), high prevalence in the species (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and the significantly different species comprised a minor percentage of the total functional potential&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). However, leaving out the significantly different species showed that they contributed considerably to the observed significant changes in functional potential for multiple of the modules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

In addition, participants reported improved postprandial well-being after the standardised meal following the low-gluten diet compared to the high-gluten diet (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Whereas the change in breath hydrogen was primarily driven by the low-gluten diet, the change in postprandial well-being was unexpectedly primarily driven by the high-gluten diet. However, the reduction in breath hydrogen was convergent with participants reporting less bloating following the 8-week low-gluten intervention compared with the 8-week high-gluten intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Together these observations suggest an altered intestinal fermentation in accordance with the changes in bacterial modules associated with carbohydrate metabolism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Indeed, several differences in carbohydrate composition were found between diets including higher levels of galactose, rhamnose, mannose, and galacturonic acid and lower levels of arabinose and xylose in the low-gluten diet compared with the high-gluten diet (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). These nutritional changes were in agreement with a reduced bacterial arabinose/lactose transport potential following the low-gluten dieting (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There was no differences in the total amount of dietary fermentable, oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>) or in intake of resistant starch (Supplementary Table 2) between the two diets. Yet, qualitative differences were observed, such as lower levels of fructooligosaccharides and mannitol/sorbitol and higher levels of lactose in the low-gluten diet. In support of a changed intestinal fermentation, breath hydrogen concentrations were negatively associated with gut metabolic modules related to methanogenesis (Supplementary Table 8). The latter comprises reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> using H<sub>2</sub> or formate as electron donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> occurring alongside proteolytic degradation following prolonged intestinal transit times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

We also demonstrated an increase in postprandial plasma concentrations of peptide YY (PYY) in response to the standardised meal after the low-gluten intervention compared with the high-gluten intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>; <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>AUC</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012, linear mixed model).

However, we did not observe any differences in total energy intake during the two interventions (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). There were no changes in levels of the proximal incretin hormone gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), and no changes in the distal gut hormone glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a regulator of gut mucosal adaptation and growth; GLP-2 is known to be secreted in comparable amounts in parallel to the appetite regulating hormone GLP-1, and it may therefore be assumed that also GLP-1 secretion was unchanged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that a different mechanism is responsible for the weight loss. Colonic short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), synthesized by the gut microbiota during fibre fermentation, are known to increase plasma PYY levels, fat oxidation and energy expenditure in overweight men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe any associations between changes in fasting or postprandial plasma PYY concentrations and changes in bacterial modules associated with SCFA biosynthesis potentials (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>) or in faecal and serum concentrations of SCFA (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Fasting plasma PYY concentrations have been negatively associated with various markers of adiposity and resting metabolic rate in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and long-term elevated PYY concentrations are associated with enhanced thermogenesis in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Among the differing urine metabolites, &#x003b2;-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) was increased following the low-gluten diet compared with the high-gluten diet period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>; FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, linear mixed model). BAIBA induces browning of white adipose tissue and increases hepatic fat oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Changes in urine BAIBA concentrations were, however, not associated with the bacterial pyrimidine degradation module (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), which contains bacterial genes involved in degradation of thymine into BAIBA, suggesting that the observed changes in urine BAIBA were not related to changes in the intestinal microbiome. Rather they might be directly related to other effects of the low-gluten diet on host metabolism. Together, the increased urine concentrations of BAIBA and the elevated postprandial plasma levels of PYY suggest that intake of the low-gluten diet modulated energy homoeostasis by changing thermogenesis or fat oxidation. To explore these hypotheses, we performed targeted metabolomics quantifying fatty acids, acyl-carnitines (transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown), and BAIBA in serum. Besides a significant increase in serum linoleyl-carnitine following the low-gluten diet compared with the high-gluten diet, these metabolites were not changed (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), suggesting unaltered fat oxidation.

Analyses of these metabolites did reveal a significant increase in faecal kynurenine concentrations following the low-gluten diet intervention compared with the high-gluten diet intervention (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005, linear mixed model). Compared with healthy controls, coeliac disease patients adhering to a GFD have been reported to have lower serum concentrations of aromatic amino acids including tryptophan, the substrate for kynurenine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we quantified serum and faeces concentrations of the aromatic amino acids and their derivatives. Since concentrations of tryptophan and microbial tryptophan catabolites were unaltered (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>), the observed increase in kynurenine faeces concentration following the low-gluten diet suggested altered microbiota tryptophan degradation pathways rather than being a mere consequence of substrate availability. Indeed, targeted metagenomic module analyses revealed a proportional decrease in the potential of the tryptophan to serotonin synthesis pathway (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) following the low-gluten diet. Moreover, we found the ratios of the proportional abundances of their respective production pathways and faecal concentrations to correlate (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>; Spearman rho&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>), suggesting a balance between both tryptophan conversion routes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref><bold>)</bold>.

These interventions generally reduce intake of wheat or exclude wheat, suggesting a close relationship between wheat intake and the abundance of bifidobacteria in adults.

Indeed, the fibre composition analysis of the two intervention diets showed lower concentration of arabinose in the low-gluten products compared to the high-gluten products. This was in agreement with changes in the functional potential of the microbiome upon the low-gluten dieting. A module representing a L-arabinose/lactose transport system and a custom module representing arabinose degradation, which converts L-arabinose to L-ribulose-5-phosphate, were significantly reduced during a low-gluten diet. Further, L-ribulose-5-phosphate is utilized by the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, which was also significantly reduced during the low-gluten period compared to the high-gluten period. This suggests that the replacement of grain-derived fibres of wheat, barley and rye with dietary fibres of other sources during the low-gluten diet intervention caused the observed changes in the intestinal microbiome. Importantly, in accordance with the diets being matched for dietary fibres, we did not during our 8-week intervention observe any changes in faecal and serum SCFA. Furthermore, we did not find any health implications associated with the reduction in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and butyrate-producing species following the low-gluten diet, although the long-term health consequences remain unknown.</p><p id="Par16">Despite the unchanged concentrations of SCFA concentration in serum and faeces, we observed a reduction in both fasting and postprandial hydrogen exhalation following the low-gluten diet intervention and multiple changes in urine metabolites reflecting a changed intestinal fermentation. In line with this, a previous study reported that fasting breath hydrogen concentrations were significantly lower in coeliac disease patients on a GFD compared with untreated coeliac disease patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

To which extent the concurrent improvements in well-being and bloating following the low-gluten diet intervention as compared with the high-gluten diet period, were prompted by changes in the intestinal microbiome and fermentation, or were due to psychological (placebo) effects remain unresolved.</p><p id="Par17">No effects on glucose and lipid metabolism were found. However, despite unaltered self-reported energy intake by study participants, the low-gluten diet was temporarily linked with a significant weight loss. This is in line with two studies in mice fed a gliadin-enriched, high-fat diet showing an increase in body weight and adiposity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.

Based on the observed increase of plasma PYY and urinary BAIBA concentrations following the low-gluten diet, we hypothesized that the reduced body weight induced by low-gluten intervention might in part be mediated by an increased thermogenesis. Recent studies in mice have indicated that increased intake of gluten may increase hepatic lipid accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, reduce the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and the size of adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Here we found that faecal concentrations of kynurenine were increased following the low-gluten diet and associated with urine BAIBA, raising the intriguing possibility that kynurenine, via the downstream product of kynurenic acid, enhance thermogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> through activation of Gpr35 in the gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Obviously, further interventions in humans are warranted to specifically delineate whether intake of a low-gluten diet modulates energy homoeostasis.</p><p id="Par18">Our analyses showed that the low-gluten diet had no effect on circulating white blood cell counts or markers of systemic inflammation in unstimulated blood or on measures of intestinal inflammation.

Similarly, a previous study reported that production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with faecal water was reduced after a GFD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.
