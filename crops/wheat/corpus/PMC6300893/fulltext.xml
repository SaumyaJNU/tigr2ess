The annual sugarcane production was around 1900 million tones worldwide in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Brazil, China, India, and Thailand are the main sugarcane producers, all together representing 70% of the total worldwide sugarcane production, with Brazil alone having a 40% share. One ton of harvested sugarcane generates approximately 275&#x000a0;kg of bagasse with 50% moisture content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most of the bagasse is burned for electricity production to supply the energy needed in the mills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but combustion to electricity is often inefficient. Alternatively, sugarcane bagasse, which represents an enormous amount of waste material, can be used for second-generation (2G) bioethanol production.</p><p id="Par11">Having one of the most advanced biofuel programs significantly based on sugarcane ethanol, Brazil has a great interest in the integration of novel and more efficient technologies for the upgrading of the lignocellulosic biomass obtained in the well-establish first-generation (1G) process. The development of 2G bioethanol processes, especially in combination with existing 1G bioethanol industries, is one attractive option, as it can utilize existing energy supply systems and equipment, such as bioreactors for fermentation and distillation columns. Besides, it is advantageous that sugarcane bagasse is already available on-site, thus decreasing logistics costs. Moreover, since only about one-third to half of the available bagasse is required to produce the energy needed for the 1G bioethanol process, the integration of the 2G process is estimated to increase the total ethanol production by 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The advantages of the integrated 1G/2G bioethanol production were already emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furlan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] compared the economic feasibility of 1G, 1G plus electric energy, and integrated 1G/2G bioethanol biorefinery plants in Brazil and concluded that the dedicated 1G/2G bioethanol biorefinery was most advantageous. Furthermore, different levels of integration between 1G and 2G ethanol production showed better economic results compared to stand-alone plants, especially when advanced hydrolysis techniques and pentose fermentation were included (5). The usage of the whole sugarcane lignocellulosic biomass (bagasse, straw and tops) can significantly increase 2G ethanol production when compared to the use of the bagasse alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It should be noted that 1G bioethanol plants typically run their processes for only 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;months per year, since sugarcane could not be harvested in the rainy season. Therefore, technologies allowing long-term storage of the bagasse are an attractive option for integration of 1G/2G bioethanol biorefineries. The utilization of other crops during the off-season period is an alternative, but it requires further logistics and process adaptations as in the case of corn-starch bioethanol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Pretreatment is one of the most important and expensive steps in lignocellulosic ethanol biorefineries. For the utilization of sugarcane bagasse, the costs of alkaline pretreatment and the long process time of biological pretreatment have been found to be the limiting factors for large-scale 2G bioethanol applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hydrothermal processing has been considered a cost-effective and environmentally friendly pretreatment method as it (i) does not require the addition and recovery of chemicals; (ii) has limited equipment corrosion problems; (iii) has simple and economical operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Sugarcane bagasse has a dry matter content of approximately 50% which is almost the optimal value for hydrothermal pretreatment. Therefore, dry biomass storage would not be necessary and advantageous, as drying would not only increase costs but would also potentially increase the recalcitrance of the biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, due to its natural moisture content, sugarcane bagasse during storage can be easily subjected to spontaneous deterioration by different microorganisms and significant reduction of available saccharides.</p><p id="Par14">Ensiling provides a controlled solution for wet storage and long-term preservation of the material, as fermentation with lactic acid bacteria prevents extensive biomass degradation by other microbes. Due to acidification by organic acids during ensiling, the decreased pH prevents the growth and proliferation of degrading microorganisms (e.g., fungi and competing bacteria able to degrade polysaccharides), and preserves the biomass. During storage, the low pH can initiate a pretreatment effect on the biomass by partly degrading the biomass structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This preservation method allows for a biomass pretreatment combined with storage practice, which does not require large capital investments or energy inputs.</p><p id="Par15">Ensiling has been previously combined with hydrothermal pretreatment (HTT) on wheat straw and grass, with stream explosion on hemp, and in combination with fungal delignification on wheat straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Combination of two biological pretreatments (ensiling and fungal pretreatment) can be advantageous in developing countries, where smaller bioenergy production units are favorable due to limited biomass logistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Combination of ensiling with steam pretreatment did not show significant effect for the conversion of hemp to ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, ensiling of wheat straw prior to HTT has shown significant improvement of pretreatment and overall 2G bioethanol process, being proposed to reduce pretreatment costs on large-scale operations by reducing the HTT temperature or by increasing overall conversion yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similar experiments on grass have shown that the improvements are significantly lower than on wheat straw, which emphasizes that the effect of ensiling in HTT is biomass dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of ensiling prior to HTT as an effective combinatorial pretreatment to process sugarcane bagasse for 2G bioethanol production. The organic acids production at low dry matter content during ensiling can catalyze hydrothermal pretreatment, reducing the pretreatment temperature and thus overall energy consumption. The hypothesis is that the conversion of sugarcane bagasse to ethanol similarly to wheat straw will decrease the necessary temperature of HTT if ensiling is used prior. The pretreatment effectiveness was measured by glucose recovery after enzymatic hydrolysis and by subsequent bioethanol production by fermentation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ensiling of sugarcane bagasse</title><p id="Par17">After 4 weeks ensiling of SCB minimal weight loss (0.1% w/w) was observed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) indicating that the biomass was well preserved.

</p><p id="Par18">The produced lactic and acetic acids, 4.5 and 3.5% (w/w), respectively, caused a pH drop from the initial 7.0 to 4.1. From the 7% (w/w) xylose supplemented for the ensiling process, approximately half (3.6% w/w) was recovered in the water extract from ESCB. Using the same approach for ensiling of wheat straw, Ambye-Jensen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] recovered only 1.3% (w/w) xylose at the end of the process. Considering the stoichiometry of xylose fermentation to lactic and acetic acids, the 3.4% (w/w) xylose consumed would yield at maximum 2.0 and 1.4% (w/w) lactic and acetic acids, respectively. The high concentration of organic acids obtained in the ensiling process suggests that the supplemented xylose is not the only carbon source used in the anaerobic fermentation process. Dewar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that the production of organic acids in biomass silage led to partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose fraction. However, in the case of wheat straw ensiling, the released xylose from hemicellulose counted for a negligible fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study, the maintenance of the hemicellulose content in the ESCB (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) implies that the contribution from hemicellulose for the acid products obtained during ensiling can mainly result from deacetylation of this fraction. The lower amount of glucan and water extractives in ESCB when compared to SCB (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) indicates that some carbohydrates have been utilized by the bacteria during ensiling. Taking into account that SCB contains residual non-structural carbohydrates from sugarcane processing (e.g., sucrose), the use of xylose supplementation to boost ensiling may be avoided.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Solid fiber yields after HTT and chemical composition of the solid fibers from raw sugarcane bagasse (SCB), hydrothermal pretreated sugarcane bagasse (HTT SCB), ensiled sugarcane bagasse (ESCB), and hydrothermal pretreated ensiled sugarcane bagasse (HTT ESCB)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Cellulose<break/>(w/w% of DM)</th><th align="left">Hemicellulose<break/>(w/w% of DM)</th><th align="left">Lignin<break/>(w/w% of DM)</th><th align="left">Extractives<sup>a</sup><break/>(w/w% of DM)</th><th align="left">Solid fiber yield (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">SCB</td><td align="left">36.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.2</td><td align="left">22.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.1</td><td align="left">16.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6</td><td align="left">18.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.0</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT SCB 160&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">41.8</td><td align="left">23.8</td><td align="left">21.8</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">85.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT SCB 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">43.3</td><td align="left">22.0</td><td align="left">22.2</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">78.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT SCB 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">47.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7</td><td align="left">19.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6</td><td align="left">23.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">80.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT SCB 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">49.4</td><td align="left">13.6</td><td align="left">24.9</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">68.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ESCB</td><td align="left">32.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3</td><td align="left">22.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2</td><td align="left">18.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1</td><td align="left">13.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9</td><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT ESCB 160&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">40.9</td><td align="left">23.9</td><td align="left">21.2</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">75.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT ESCB 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">44.3</td><td align="left">19.8</td><td align="left">22.8</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">71.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT ESCB 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">45.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.4</td><td align="left">17.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1</td><td align="left">23.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">72.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;HTT ESCB 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C</td><td align="left">48.6</td><td align="left">11.9</td><td align="left">25.4</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">63.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Extractives are the result of water extraction</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effect of ensiling and hydrothermal pretreatment in the composition of solid fibers</title><p id="Par19">Hydrothermal pretreatment was carried out on both SCB and ESCB. The slurry after pretreatment was separated into solid and liquid fractions. The composition of the solid fibers from untreated SCB (SCB) and hydrothermally pretreated SCB (HTT SCB) was compared to those from ensiled SCB (ESCB) and hydrothermally pretreated ESCB (HTT ESCB) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The comparison of the glucan content of SCB with that of ESCB shows that ensiling preserves most of the cellulose (90%). Still, this result contrasts with that of wheat straw ensiling, where almost all the cellulose (99%) was preserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During HTT at high temperatures (160&#x02013;190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), water acts as a weak acid and initiates the mechanism of autohydrolysis and acetyl groups are released from hemicellulose, further enabling the solubilization of this fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This feature can be observed from the results in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> comparing untreated and pretreated samples. Since hemicellulose was partially solubilized with HTT, cellulose and lignin were up-concentrated in the solid fibers of pretreated biomass, a phenomenon that is intensified at higher temperatures. However, no significant impact of ensiling was observed in the cellulose and lignin content of the solid fibers. Cellulose obtained from HTT SCB and HTT ESCB between 160 and 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C ranged between 41.8 and 49.4% in HTT SCB, and between 40.9 and 48.6% in HTT ESCB, representing a glucan recovery of more than 90% in relation to the SCB and ESCB content in all the HTT conditions tested (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, see next section). The increase of temperature in HTT also up-concentrated lignin in the solid fibers, both on SCB and ESCB, ranging from 21 to 22% at 160&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to around 25% at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. During hydrothermal pretreatment, lignin is melted, diffused out of the cell wall matrix, and redistributed on the fibers surface, thus HTT rearranges the lignin fraction of the biomass rather than removing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">The combination of ensiling with HTT impacted differently in the composition of the solid fibers, mainly in the hemicellulose content. At 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, ensiling extended the overall effect of the pretreatment reducing hemicellulose content from 22.0% (HTT SCB 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to 19.8% (HTT ESCB 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). In fact, the solubilization of hemicellulose at 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C after ensiling (HTT ESCB 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) is similar to the one obtained at 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C without prior ensiling (HTT SCB 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C)&#x02014;hemicellulose content of solid fibers of 19.8 and 19.1%, respectively. A more extended hemicellulose solubilization was obtained with HTT at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, where the hemicellulose in the solid fibers was nearly halved for both SCB (from 22.3 to 13.6%) and ESCB (from 22.3 to 11.9%). The impact of ensiling on hemicellulose solubilization after HTT can be observed comparing HTT ESCB and HTT SCB at 170, 180, and 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

</p><p id="Par27">The cellulose conversion increased with the HTT temperature, as denoted by the higher glucose recovery yields, which reaches more than 85% in the HTT ESCB 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The highest glucose recovery without ensiling was 75.5%, at the highest HTT temperature (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Lower HTT temperatures resulted in significantly lower cellulose conversion: for example, at 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis was only 61% of that at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The low cellulose digestibility (&#x0003c;&#x02009;50%) at 160 and 170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C showed that the severity at these temperatures was not sufficient enough to disrupt the lignocellulose structure both with and without means of ensiling. The best results obtained for enzymatic hydrolysis of HTT SCB were similar or higher than the previously reported. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported 68.3% enzymatic hydrolysis yield of SCB with liquid hot water pretreatment at 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x000a0;min when a fed-batch process was applied. In turn, Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Rocha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] achieved only 56.9% hydrolysis yield at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min, compared to our results which reached the 70.1% under similar severity conditions. This can be most likely due to the (i) difference in biomass composition as in our study, the sugarcane bagasse had significantly lower lignin content or (ii) the applied higher solid loading (10%) at Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Rocha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. On untreated SCB, those authors achieved a hydrolysis yield of only 6.0%, while in this work, cellulose conversion yield of SCB achieved 18.4%. Those authors were able to increase significantly the glucose recovery yield when delignification was applied after HTT. When HTT at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min was followed by delignification (with NaOH 1.0% (w/v), 100&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 1&#x000a0;h), the enzymatic hydrolysis yield increased to 89.2% which is similar to that achieved in this work when HTT was combined with ensiling (86.9%).</p><p id="Par28">The data also showed that even though ensiling improved the cellulose digestibility when combined with HTT, ensiling as a stand-alone pretreatment was not effective, as only 23.0% (0.09&#x000a0;g/g) of the available glucose in the raw material could be obtained. In fact, the glucose recovery yields after enzymatic hydrolysis were improved when ensiling was combined with HTT. At all temperatures, the combination of ensiling and HTT led to an increase in cellulose conversion of 10&#x02013;15% in relation to stand-alone HTT. The highest overall glucose recovery yield (0.30&#x000a0;g/g) was achieved with HTT ESCB at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, which represents approx. 75% of glucose equivalents in the raw material, 5% more than with HTT SCB at the same temperature. The positive effect of ensiling combined with HTT can be both due to the long impregnation time with organic acids during ensiling, and due to the contribution of lower pH at the beginning of HTT, which increases HTT severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Similar experiments were performed on wheat straw (WS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The cellulose digestibility of the HTT WS increased with the HTT temperature similarly to SCB, especially from 180 to 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, where the glucose recovery yield raised from 45.9 to 71.5%. The prior ensiling before HTT of WS resulted in an increase of the glucose recovery yield up to 78.7% and 73.5%, respectively, for 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The benefits of wheat straw ensiling combined with HTT pretreatment on higher cellulose conversion were observed only at lower (170&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) HTT temperatures. The findings potentially enable a considerable decrease in the necessary process temperature in HTT of WS, thereby having a positive effect on large-scale pretreatment costs. On SCB, an increased glucose recovery was observed at all temperatures when ensiling was applied prior to HTT. In this case, the recommendation is, thus, not to decrease HTT temperature as with WS. The benefits, found in this study, of ensiling SCB prior to HTT rely in the higher overall glucose recovery yield when compared with that obtained without ensiling at high HTT temperature. Moreover, the ensiling process will prevent fast deterioration of SCB in a combined 1G/2G ethanol plant.</p><p id="Par30">Both with WS and SCB, ensiling was found to provide significant advantages when combined with HTT, but these benefits largely depend on the type of biomass. While ensiling of WS in combination with HTT facilitated a reduction in HTT temperature up to 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, ensiling of SCB consistently increased HTT efficiency in terms of cellulose digestibility in 10&#x02013;15%. The impact of structural differences of biomass has been further confirmed when similar experiments were performed on grass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Even though the ensiling of grass prior HTT caused also increased solubilization and higher concentration of cellulose in the solid fibers compared to non-ensiled grass, the improvement was significantly lower than that found on WS and now on SCB.</p><p id="Par31">On WS, it was concluded that substantial more released sugar was gained than the 7% xylose was used to facilitate the ensiling process. In contrast, with grass, the loss of water-soluble carbohydrates during ensiling had a large drawback on the overall sugar recovered. The positive effect of ensiling SCB prior HTT can be quantified by comparing the overall sugar recovery yields at the same temperatures. Comparing the released glucose at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C from SCB and ESCB, it can be concluded that more released sugar was achieved than was added to facilitate ensiling. Furthermore, the results of excess xylose in the water extract of ESCB suggest that supplementation of sugars is not needed to boost ensiling in the case of SCB.</p><p id="Par32">Hemp silage was ensiled without any additives and the results indicated that the silage was well preserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, steam explosion pretreatment in combination with ensiling could not increase the overall glucose recovery yield.</p><p id="Par33">In other studies, pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse by steam explosion without addition of SO<sub>2</sub> after one month storage with lactic acid led to 79% glucose recovery yield after enzymatic hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which was similar to the pretreatment when SO<sub>2</sub> was only used as the impregnating agent. The results, however, also showed in that study that longer storage time with lactic acid had slightly negative impact. In our study, ensiling was performed for 1&#x000a0;month but the isolated effect of the storage duration was not assessed and should be assessed in future studies.</p><p id="Par34">The digestibility of hemicellulose in the solid fibers is higher at higher HTT temperatures, the same trend observed for cellulose digestibility. The xylose recovery yields after enzymatic hydrolysis were 15&#x02013;30% higher for the ensiled samples when processed by HTT at lower temperatures (160&#x02013;180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), whereas at HTT 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the percentage of xylose recovery from the solid fibers was 95% for both ensiled and not ensiled SCB. The overall xylose recovery yield does not increase after 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as the overall glucose does. This may be explained by the significant degradation of the released xylose at the highest HTT temperature tested (190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), in line with the lower hemicellulose conversion observed (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">These results showed that the highest overall sugar recovery is when ensiling is combined with the highest HTT temperature (190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). Here, the digestibility of cellulose is the highest and the overall xylose recovery is similar to that of 180&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, since hemicellulose digestibility is counterbalanced with xylose degradation in the liquid fraction at 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Effect of combining ensiling and hydrothermal treatment on ethanol production by SSF</title><p id="Par36">Enzymatic hydrolysis is a good tool for the evaluation of pretreatment efficiency.

Therefore, further studies need to address the fermentation of the whole slurry in order to study the effect of both organic compounds produced during ensiling, which can be concentrated in the liquid fraction as well as compounds produced during pretreatment with regard to potential inhibition for ethanol fermentation by the yeasts. These inhibitors could especially influence the fermentation of xylose. Sipos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] performed steam pretreatment on hemp and on ensiled hemp.

The lower ethanol yield was explained by the presence of acetic acid at a concentration of 6.8&#x000a0;g/l. It is important to emphasize that the authors applied steam explosion at high temperature (210&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), so probably other compounds (e.g., sugar degradation products) also contributed to the inhibition. Acetic acid and sugar- and lignin-degradation products are among the inhibitory compounds generated from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The individual effect of acetic acid at concentrations up to 6&#x000a0;g/l does not significantly impact in ethanol fermentation with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and at a certain concentration, it can help yeast cells overcoming HMF stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Higher concentrations than 6&#x000a0;g/l have been reported to result in a decrease in the ethanol yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Ensiling of SCB resulted in an acetic acid production of 52.5&#x000a0;mg/g DM ESCB. Performing HTT pretreatment at high solid loading (25&#x02013;35%) on ESCB therefore could potentially result in the concentration of acetic acid at a range of 13&#x02013;18&#x000a0;g/l. Maize silage has been previously tested for ethanol fermentation at similar conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and 78% of the theoretical ethanol yield was achieved, similarly to our results on ensiled SCB. During that study, the liquid fraction obtained after each pretreatment (185&#x02013;195&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) was tested for toxicity against yeast. Inhibition effect was not observed and it even resulted in slightly higher ethanol yield due to the presence of acetic acid at low (&#x0003c;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;g/l) concentrations. In our case, assuming high solid loading at pretreatment, the acetic acid concentration is higher which might affect ethanol fermentation negatively. However, studies showed that the inhibitory effect of acetic acid can be overcome by (i) different detoxification methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], (ii) adaptation of the applied yeast to inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], (iii) performing the fermentation in membrane bioreactor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">The combination of ensiling with HTT was evaluated for the conversion of SCB to ethanol. Ensiling prior to HTT catalyzes hydrothermal pretreatment causing increased hemicellulose solubilization and higher concentration of cellulose in the solid fibers compared to non-ensiled SCB. The effect of the pretreatment was determined by enzymatic hydrolysis and SSF of the solid fibers. Ensiling of sugarcane bagasse improved both the enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation.</p><p id="Par43">The effect of ensiling in combination with HTT as pretreatment is, however, highly case- and biomass-specific. While when applied to wheat straw this pretreatment process had previously enabled the decreasing of process temperature for HTT in 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, when applied to SCB, ensiling consistently increases HTT efficiency in terms of cellulose digestibility at temperatures between 170 and 190&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. For the sugarcane bagasse, the ensiling can provide two beneficial effects: (i) preservation of the material for longer storage periods without drying, (ii) increase sugar recovery and final ethanol yield up to 10%, depending on the HTT temperature used. This process can be optimized and tested at pilot scale to be implemented in integrated 1G/2G sugarcane ethanol plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Raw material</title><p id="Par44">Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) (<italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> L.) originated from Louisiana, USA.

Each batch of ensiling contained 1.3&#x000a0;kg DM SCB.

The commercially available inoculum LACTISIL CCM (Chr.
