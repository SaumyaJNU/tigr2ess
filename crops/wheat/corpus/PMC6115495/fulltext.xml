Pulse crops play an important role in the development of sustainable cropping systems, and producers in the Canadian prairies often increase the frequency of pulses in their cropping systems. In this study, we determined the shifts in the fungal community of pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L.) rhizosphere, as influenced by the frequency of pulses in rotation, using high throughput sequencing. Six cropping systems containing pea (P), lentil (<italic>Lens culinaris</italic> Medik., L), hybrid canola (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L., C), wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L., W), and oat (<italic>Avena sativa</italic> L., O) in different intensities were tested. The fungal communities were assessed at the flowering stage in the fourth and fifth year of the 4-year rotations. Cropping system had a significant impact on the composition of the rhizosphere fungal community, and the effect of crop rotation sequence was greater and explained more of the variation than the effect of previous crops. The rotation with consecutive pulses (WPLP) decreased fungal evenness and increased the proportion of pathotrophs. <italic>Fusarium</italic> was a dominant and ubiquitous pathotrophic genus. <italic>Olpidium virulentus, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium solani, F. graminearum</italic>, and <italic>Alternaria eichhorniae</italic> were generally more abundant in pulse intensive rotations (WPLP, WLOP, and WPOP), the exception being <italic>F. solani</italic> which was not promoted by lentil. Reads of <italic>O. virulentus</italic> and <italic>B. cinerea</italic> were most abundant in pea preceded by lentil followed by the reads of <italic>Mortierella elongata</italic> in pea preceded by wheat. Pea consistently had higher grain yield when grown in diversified rotations including wheat, canola/lentil, and oat than rotations with two repeated crops (canola or pea). Cropping system affected the soil physicochemical properties, and soil pH was the main driver of fungal community shift. No evidence of beneficial microorganisms involvement in plant productivity was observed, but the high abundance of pathotrophs in pulse intensified rotations suggests the possibility of pathogen buildup in the soil with increasing pulse frequency. Diversifying rotation sequences minimized disease risk and increased pea production, in this study. Careful selection of plant species appears as a strategy for the management of rhizosphere fungal communities and the maintenance of crop production system&#x02019;s health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cropping system</kwd><kwd>field pea</kwd><kwd>high throughput sequencing</kwd><kwd>pathotrophs</kwd><kwd>rhizosphere fungal diversity</kwd><kwd>soil physicochemical properties</kwd><kwd><italic>Olpidium virulentus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="75"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Agroecosystem productivity is often restricted by water availability, and the challenge is serious in many arid and semiarid regions of the world (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Borontov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Rasouli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). Summer fallow has historically been an important farming practice to mitigate the impact of moisture deficit in dry areas, including the Canadian prairies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2002</xref>). However, summer fallowing practices have serious environmental consequences. The introduction of pulse crops, such as field pea, lentil, and chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L.) into the traditional cereal-fallow-based agricultural systems has increased agricultural productivity while decreasing environmental impacts (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">MacWilliam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). Pulse crops have also changed soil biology and biological processes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Lupwayi and Kennedy, 2007</xref>). In particular, cereal crops producing good grain yield are highly N use efficient when they follow N<sub>2</sub>-fixing legumes in rotation largely because lesser amounts of fertilizer are required (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Luis et al., 2014</xref>). The introduction of pulses in rotation influences N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria, and may well influence the overall microbial environment of crops. On the northern Great Plains of North America, there is a trend of increasing the frequency of pulses in cropping systems. However, information on how the frequency of pulse crops in cropping systems impacts the soil microbial community is lacking.</p><p>Soil microbial communities are the most abundant reservoir of known biological diversity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>). Plants live in close association with the soil microbes and are able to shape microbial communities. The root microbiome of plants grown in the same soil differ between plant species (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Garbeva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Berg and Smalla, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>), and some plant species can forge similar microbial communities in different soils (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Miethling et al., 2000</xref>). Plants exert such influence on the composition of rhizosphere microbiome by secreting compounds that selectively stimulate or repress members of the community (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Doornbos et al., 2012</xref>). Soil fungi are an important component of the soil microbiome and contribute to key processes in soil (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Joergensen and Wichern, 2008</xref>). Fungal communities can increase plant resilience to abiotic stress, cause diseases as well as reduce the incidence of diseases, and provide the ecological services of nutrient cycling (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bridge and Spooner, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Lupwayi and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Penton et al., 2014</xref>). The composition of the fungal community of crop rhizosphere is an important determinant of crop success (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Appuhn and Joergensen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>). Variations in the composition of rhizosphere fungal communities are partly attributable to plant host effects (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bonito et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pea is one of the pulse crops most widely used in the northern Great Plains. Inclusion of pea in cropping systems enhances soil water conservation, increases soil N level, and system productivity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). The improved performance of crops is partly due to the stimulation of beneficial soil microorganisms, including plant growth-promoting microorganisms and biocontrol agents (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Lupwayi and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Vujanovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). However, frequent pea crops in cropping systems had negative effects, including decreased net income (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Vigil, 2017</xref>), reduced soil fungal diversity, increased proportion of fungal pathotrophs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bainard et al., 2017</xref>), depressed soil organic carbon level, and dehydrogenase, phosphatase, and urease activity (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Nayyar et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, we focus on the relationship between the composition of the fungal community of the pea rhizosphere and the frequency of pea and pea preceded crops in pulse and cereal based cropping systems.</p><p>Producers in the Canadian prairies consider pulses as economically beneficial crops and often increase the frequency of pulses in their cropping systems. However, how increased pulse frequency in cropping systems may affect soil biological quality is largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the impact of cereal, oilseed and pulse-base cropping systems on the fungal community of the pea rhizosphere. The specific objectives of this research were to (1) determine the effect of cropping system on the composition and diversity of the fungal community of pea rhizosphere, (2) relate the changes in soil properties induced by cropping systems to the variation in fungal community composition, and (3) determine the impact of cropping systems or fungal communities on the agronomic performance of pea. We hypothesize that the pea rhizosphere fungal community is significantly affected by pea crop frequency and sequence under different cropping systems, and in turn affects pea growth and productivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Site Description and Experimental Design</title><p>The field experiment was conducted from 2012 to 2016 at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Farm in Indian Head (50&#x000b0;32&#x02032;N, 103&#x000b0;40&#x02032;W), Saskatchewan. The soil was a Redo Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll) with saturated paste pH of 7.1 in the 0&#x02013;15 cm depth, and a heavy clay texture, as it contains 15.0% sand, 32.5% silt, and 52.5% clay.</p><p>The experiment had six cropping systems each with four phases. All rotation phases were present every year. Treatments were laid in a randomized complete block design with four repetitions, in 96 plots. Plot sizes were 4 m &#x000d7; 12 m. In the 4-year rotation cycle, pea (P), lentil (L), hybrid canola (C), spring wheat (W), and oat (O) were seeded in different intensities to constitute six cropping systems: CWCP, WCLP, WCOP, WPCP, WPLP, and WPOP (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SMT1">S1</xref></bold>). The first rotation cycle started in spring 2012 and was completed in fall 2015, and second cycle commenced in 2016.</p><p>Crops were seeded in early May each year and managed according to recommended agronomic practices. Wheat and pulse seeds were treated with Vitaflo 280 (containing carbathiin 15.59% and thiram 13.25%) and Apron Maxx (containing fludioxonil 0.73% and metalaxyl-M and S-isomer 1.10%), respectively, at a rate of 3.3 ml kg<sup>-1</sup> of seed. Pulse seeds were inoculated with commercial granular <italic>Rhizobium</italic> inoculants following manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation before seeding. The field target N rate (soil residue N plus fertilizer N) was 110 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for wheat, 120 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for canola, and 80 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for oat in the top 0&#x02013;60 cm soil layer (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SMT2">S2</xref></bold>). No N-fertilizer was applied to the pulse crops (pea and lentil). The P, K, and S fertilizers were applied to the crops based on soil test recommendation made on samples taken in fall.

For the rhizosphere soil samples, three points (4&#x02013;5 plants per point) were randomly selected in a plot and plant roots were excavated. Shoots were detached with scissors and roots with adhering soil were placed in labeled Ziploc bags, and immediately stored in a cooler. In the laboratory, rhizosphere soil was brushed off the root surface and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove rocks and roots, then immediately stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Bulked soil samples from the crop row were also collected at the same time as the rhizosphere soil and the soil physicochemical properties of the bulk soil were determined. In each plot, six soil cores (2 cm diameter and 15 cm deep) were collected from three selected points, homogenized, and combined to form a composite sample. After soil sample was passed through 2 mm sieve, a subsample was used for soil moisture measurement, and the remainder was air dried to determine soil pH, electrical conductivity, and soil nutrient analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Analyses</title><p>Total DNA was extracted from approximately 0.25 g of rhizosphere soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, United States) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

Pea preceded crop was analyzed to determine the pulse crop sequence effect. The effect of previous crops (wheat, canola, lentil, and oat) on the fungal community of pea rhizosphere and pea grain yield, was analyzed independently among the rotations WPCP, WPLP, and WPOP, which included two pea crops.

Our results showed that climatic factors (e.g., precipitation, temperature) and cropping system had significant effects on the composition of rhizosphere fungal communities, and these effects explained more of the variation than previous crops in the fungal communities. Climatic factors had a strong effect on fungal richness, while cropping systems and previous crops in rotation had strong effects on fungal evenness. Rotations with continuous pulses (i.e., WPLP) or pea preceded by lentil decreased rhizosphere fungal evenness but increased the proportion of fungal pathotrophs, based on partial ITS1 sequences. Among various soil properties we evaluated, soil pH and some physicochemical properties such as moisture, and Mg and Mn concentrations appeared as the best predictors of fungal communities. Rotations with more crop diversity (i.e., WCOP and WLOP) had the highest pea grain yields among the six cropping systems evaluated in the study.</p><p>In this study, soil pH varied significantly among the cropping systems, and significant relationship of soil pH with other soil nutrients was observed. With few exceptions, concentration of most of the micronutrients decreased with increasing soil pH (<bold>Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SMT6">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SMT7">S7</xref></bold>), a trend also reflected in cropping system. The rotations WCOP, WLOP, and WPLP had the lowest pH value and higher concentration of nutrients (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, and PO<sub>4</sub>-P) compared to the other rotations. Pea is a leguminous crop and significant proportion of its nitrogen demand is met by biological N<sub>2</sub>-fixation. During N<sub>2</sub>-fixation, pea plants take up more cations (such as K, Na, Ca, and Mg) than anions to balance the organic anions produced in the process of photosynthesis, and release H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions into the rhizosphere through roots, leading to acidification of the rhizosphere soil (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Haynes, 1983</xref>). On the other hand, high organic matter accumulation and decomposition of organic matter can change soil pH in agricultural ecosystem (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Haynes, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, six rotation systems that included four crop species with different rotation sequences and intensities might influence the composition of particulate soil organic matter and organic matter cycling efficiency, therefore the soil properties. This is probably the reason of pH variation among different rotation sequences in this study.</p><p>Soil pH strongly influenced pea rhizosphere fungal community in the current study and similar results were reported in several previous studies (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Fujimura and Egger, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bainard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Degrune et al., 2017</xref>). Fungi generally have a limited pH tolerance range and change in pH directly influence fungal community. In this study, for example, the abundance of OTU10 and OTU2 changed significantly with soil pH change (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SMT8">S8</xref></bold>). The soil microbiome has a strong relationship with soil physicochemical properties, including nutrient availability, ion exchange capacity, and organic carbon and micronutrient contents (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Berg and Smalla, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).

Peas are shallow-rooted crops with approximately 77&#x02013;85% of their roots located in the top 0 to 40 cm soil layer (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). This morphological feature may change the living environment (such as water content, pH, nutrients, soil aggregate stability etc.) relative to deep-rooted crops with fibrous root systems such as wheat, and impact the activity and composition of the fungal communities (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Hinsinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bainard et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Generally, rhizosphere microbial communities are selectively affected by plant root exudates, which largely determine the composition and activity of the microbial community, including fungi (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>).

In both years of our study, <italic>Fusarium</italic> was the most abundant fungal genera in pea rhizosphere. It was mainly composed of five species identified as <italic>F. redolens, F. solani, F. avenaceum, F. graminearum</italic>, and <italic>F. oxysporum.</italic> The finding suggests that <italic>Fusarium</italic> is a common root rot pathogen in the study area, which is in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Gossen et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that rotations including lentil critically reduced the relative abundance of <italic>F. solani</italic> reads in 2015, while the abundance of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in pea preceded by oats was fivefold higher than in other rotations in 2016 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref></bold>). This indicated the importance of crop species selection on the prevalence of pathotrophs in cropping systems. We did not investigate the pathogenicity of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> species in this study. However, it was previously shown that <italic>Fusarium</italic> root rot severity increased with continuous-pea (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Nayyar et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>Olpidium</italic> spp. is zoosporic fungi belonging to the division Chytridiomycota and obligates intracellular parasites of roots (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Rochon, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>O. virulentus</italic> is one of several major vectors of plant virus transmission (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Fry, 1966</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Sim, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Maccarone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Maccarone, 2013</xref>) and is currently the only known fungal species that transmit plant viruses (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Rochon, 2009</xref>). OTU11 sequence was identified as <italic>Olpidium brassicae</italic> using the UNITE fungal ITS database, and we manually BLAST it in NCBI and identified as <italic>O. virulentus</italic> (GenBank: KY905661.1). <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Lay et al. (2018)</xref> recently clarify that <italic>O. brassicae</italic> infects only the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic>, which includes canola, whereas <italic>O. virulentus</italic> infects a wide variety of hosts. <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Maccarone et al. (2010)</xref> compared <italic>O. virulentus</italic> and <italic>O. brassicae</italic> isolates from Brassicaceae plants, lettuce, melons, cucumbers, and other species through the amplification of the ITS regions and showed that members of the <italic>O. virulentus</italic> subgroup can be found in different crops and are not restricted by geographical barriers. We found a high abundance of <italic>O. virulentus</italic> in the rotation of intensified pulses rotated with wheat (WPLP) in both years (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>). It is possible that rotation with pea and lentil creates a more favorable environment for <italic>O. virulentus</italic> reproduction than the other rotations in this study. However, we did not observe any disease symptom linked to <italic>Olpidium</italic> spp. or the associated virus, probably because of the complexity of the interactions of <italic>Olpidium</italic> vector with viruses and plant hosts (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Maccarone, 2013</xref>). The high abundance of <italic>O. virulentus</italic> in both years suggests that this soil borne fungal species or associated viruses are prevalent in local farmlands. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>O. virulentus</italic> in pea rhizosphere in western Canadian prairies.</p><p><italic>Botrytis</italic> is another group of pathogens able to cause seedling diseases in pulses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alberta Pulse Growers et al., 2016</xref>). The relative abundance of OTU58, identified as <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (NCBI: MF926241.1), was highest in 2016. <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is an ubiquitous fungal pathogen causing gray rot on a large number of economically important agricultural and horticultural crops, including pea (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Kulakiotu et al., 2004</xref>). The high abundance of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> in the rotation WPLP underscores the risk of new disease development in intensified pulse based rotation systems.</p><p>The rotational benefits of field pea include enhanced soil water conservation, improved soil N availability, and increased system productivity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). The possibility of stimulation of beneficial microorganisms by pea was also proposed previously (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Lupwayi and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). We found only a few weak relationships between fungal OTU and plant productivity, despite the presence of potentially beneficial soil fungi. <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. is one of the most common fungi present in a diverse range of habitats. <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. plays important roles as decomposers of organic materials (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Visagie et al., 2014</xref>). Many <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. showed wide range of tolerance to temperature, pH, and salinity (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2008</xref>). Some <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. can release fixed phosphorus in the soil and make it available to plants (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Saber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Sahoo and Gupta, 2014</xref>) or serve both as disease control agent and biofertilizer (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Ownley and Benson, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). For example, dry mycelium of <italic>P. chrysogenum</italic> was successfully used for the control of Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt as well as nutrient source in cotton production (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> was reported to improve P availability to coffee plants (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Posada et al., 2013</xref>). The proportion of reads of <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> (NCBI: HQ607930.1) was the highest among the <italic>Penicillium</italic> species in our study, and it was especially abundant in the pulse dominant rotations WPLP and WLOP. The positive relationship between the abundance of <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> and P availability that we observed, suggests that <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> may benefit pea growth by enhancing inorganic phosphate availability in the root zone. Further study in this area may unfold the beneficial effect of <italic>P. janthinellum</italic> on pea or crop production system as a whole.</p><p>The fungus <italic>C. rosea</italic> f. <italic>catenulate</italic> is a mycoparasite antagonizing a range of fungal plant pathogens, including <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, and <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Appuhn and Joergensen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Chatterton and Punja, 2009</xref>). The abundance of this fungus in CWCP suggests that the inclusion of canola in cropping systems might improve soil biological quality. Members of the genus <italic>Mortierella</italic> within the family <italic>Mortierellaceae</italic> are filamentous fungi commonly found in soil. One of the species, <italic>M. elongata</italic> (OTU2), was specifically abundant in the rhizosphere of intensive pea rotation preceded by wheat in our experiment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>). Previous study suggested that the species of <italic>Mortierella</italic> may benefit wheat yield (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Borrell et al., 2017</xref>). The abundance pattern of beneficial or pathogenic fungi revealed that each fungus has its own preferred growth environment, which varies with cropping system.</p><p>Diversifying cropping systems with pulses become an important farming practice that enhances system productivity, in the Canadian prairies (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2015</xref>). This study demonstrates the influence of the plants included in pea-intensified cropping systems on the properties of the soil and on the proportion fungal pathotrophs in pea rhizosphere. Cropping systems change soil physicochemical properties, which in turn influences rhizosphere fungal communities. This relationship was confirmed in 2015 by <italic>mantel</italic> test, which revealed that soil fungal community was significantly correlated with soil properties. However, the effect of rotation sequence on soil physiochemical properties was insignificant in 2016, and the influence of rotation on the composition of the pea rhizosphere community was weaker than in 2015. This phenomenon suggests that other factors, such as the soil environmental conditions (e.g., amount of precipitation and its seasonal distribution, temperature), had a greater effect on the composition and abundance of pea rhizosphere fungal community.</p><p>This study revealed the influence of 4-year cropping systems on the rhizosphere fungal community. The selection of crops and their sequence in rotation explained more of the variation in the fungal communities of pea rhizosphere in rotation phase-4 than the previous crop, at least partly due to modified soil physicochemical properties. Among soil properties, pH was the main driver of fungal community shift. Increasing the frequency of pea or pulses in the cropping system decreased fungal evenness and led to an apparent build-up of pathogens in the soil compared to diversified rotations. Frequent canola also increased the abundance of fungal pathotrophs. The build-up of fungal pathogens in the rhizosphere or in soil is a risk of disease development and yield losses, and farmers should avoid growing pulses or canola in consecutive years. Pea grown in diversified cropping systems including wheat, canola, lentil, and oat had consistently higher grain yields than cropping system including two repeated crops of canola or pea. Results from this study confirm the value of the current practice of crop diversification for improved soil properties and increased system productivity. This study also highlighted the importance of crop selection in cropping systems to maintain a healthy soil biology and ensure the productivity and profitability of crop production systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YG and WM conceived the idea, designed the project, and secured funds for the implementation of the project.
