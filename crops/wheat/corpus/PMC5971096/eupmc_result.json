    "Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn. (Pgt), is a major disease that has been effectively controlled using resistance genes. The appearance and spread of Pgt races such as Ug99, TKTTF, and TTTTF, which are virulent to most stem rust-resistant genes currently deployed in wheat breeding programs, renewed the interest in breeding cultivars resistant to wheat stem rust. It is therefore important to investigate the levels of resistance or vulnerability of wheat cultivars to Pgt races. Resistance to Pgt races 21C3CTHQM, 34MKGQM, and 34C3RTGQM was evaluated in 136 Chinese wheat cultivars at the seedling stage. A total of 124 cultivars (91.2%) were resistant to the three races. Resistance genes Sr2, Sr24, Sr25, Sr26, Sr31, and Sr38 were analyzed using molecular markers closely linked to them, and 63 of the 136 wheat cultivars carried at least one of these genes: 21, 25, and 28 wheat cultivars likely carried Sr2, Sr31, and Sr38, respectively. Cultivars \"Kehan 3\" and \"Jimai 22\" likely carried Sr25. None of the cultivars carried Sr24 or Sr26. These cultivars with known stem rust resistance genes provide valuable genetic material for breeding resistant wheat cultivars."
