    "Background:Increased platelet response is seen in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Previous reports have shown that arginine supplementation and aerobic exercise training enhance vascular nitric oxide (NO) activity and inhibit platelet hyperaggregability; however, the effects of their association remain unknown. Aim:To investigate whether arginine supplementation and aerobic exercise association may exert beneficial effects, reducing platelet hyperaggregability in rats under high risk to develop metabolic syndrome. Methods:Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (C) and fructose (F - water with 10% of fructose). After two weeks, the F group was subdivided into four groups: F, the same as before; fructose + arginine (FA - 880 mg/kg/day of L-arginine by gavage); fructose + training (FT); and fructose + arginine + training (FTA). Treatment lasted for eight weeks. Results:The fructose administration was able to increase the collagen-induced platelet aggregation (27.4 ± 2.7%) when compared to the C group (8.0 ± 3.4%). Although the arginine supplementation (32.2 ± 6.3%) or aerobic training (23.8 ± 6.5%) did not promote any change in platelet collagen-induced hyperaggregability, the association of arginine supplementation and aerobic exercise promoted an inhibition of the platelet hyperaggregability induced by fructose administration (13.9 ± 4.4%) (P < 0.05). These effects were not observed when ADP was employed as an agonist. In addition, arginine supplementation associated with aerobic exercise promoted a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) serum levels when compared to the fructose group, demonstrating an anti-inflammatory effect. Conclusions:Our data indicate an important role of arginine supplementation associated with aerobic exercise, reducing platelet hyperaggregability and inflammatory biomarker levels in rats under high risk to develop metabolic syndrome."
