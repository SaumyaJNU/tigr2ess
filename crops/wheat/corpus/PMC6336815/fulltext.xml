In a single reaction set, each pair of primers was labeled with a specific fluorophore. Through emulsion PCR, a target DNA was amplified in droplets that functioned as micro-reactors. After product purification, different fluorescent-labeled DNA products were qualitatively analyzed by the fluorescent intensity determination. The sensitivity and specificity of the system was examined using four kinds of genetically modified (GM) maize. The qualitative results revealed high specificity and sensitivity of 0.5% (w/w). In addition, the quantitative results revealed that the absolute limit of detection was 10<sup>3</sup> copies, showing good repeatability. Moreover, the reproducibility assays were further performed using four foodborne pathogenic bacteria to further evaluate the applicability of the system. Consequently, the same qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput results were confirmed with the four GM maize. To sum up, the new EPFS system is the first analytical technology of this kind that enables simultaneous qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput analysis of multiple genes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The increases in the number of biomolecular samples that need to be analyzed generate a great demand for a high-throughput detection method. Traditional nucleic acid based technologies can usually detect only one target gene in one reaction. When dealing with complex nucleic acid samples, multiple reactions need to be performed separately, which is costly and time consuming. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an economical and more effective technique that would enable simultaneous qualitative and quantitative detection of these samples. Indeed, several multiplex detection methods of target genes have been developed and employed in the fields of food/feed identifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, medical diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and large scale sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Although conventional multiplex PCRs have always been used for amplification of nucleic acid samples, problems such as preferential amplification of shorter DNA templates, interference of multiple primer pairs and limited substrates limit their wide use in quantitative and high-throughput research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Real-time quantitative PCRs have been widely used to quantify target genes with high sensitivity, specificity and a wide dynamic range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, their throughput is low because of the limited number of channels in the real-time system. DNA microarray is a high-throughput approach used for analyzing complex nucleic samples that have limited feasible availability due to the complicated procedure and expensive consumption. Poor linearity is another weakness of DNA microarray that limits its use in quantitative analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing a novel qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput method for detecting multiple biological genes is of great importance.</p><p id="Par4">The multiplex emulsion PCR has been developed for high-throughput simultaneous amplification of several DNA targets, either used alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or combined with other methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In emulsion PCR, the different DNA targets are compartmentalized in millions of micro-reservoirs and parallelly amplified in a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Emulsion PCR, alleviates nonspecific amplification in conventional multiplex PCR, increases the throughput and reduces the regent and sample consumption.</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, we constructed and validated a novel high-throughput detection method based on combining emulsion PCR and fluorescence spectrophotometry (EPFS) for qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput detection of multiple biological genes. The new method uses the primer pairs labeled with different fluorophores, so that the multitarget DNAs in one mixed sample could be amplified in a single reaction set; and then qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed on Infinite M1000 PRO. Four genetically modified (GM) maize lines and four foodborne pathogenic bacteria were qualitatively and quantitatively tested obtaining satisfactory results. The EPFS method we developed provides a new approach for qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput analysis of multitarget DNAs for a broad range of biological samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par6">GM maize flour i.e. Bt176, GA21, NK603 and TC1507, were supplied by Monsanto Company (St. Louis, MO). Non-transgenic seeds (maize, soybean, rapeseed, wheat) were purchased from a local market in Shanghai, China. The genomic DNAs of four common foodborne pathogenic bacteria i.e. Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and the corresponding plasmids used for reproducibility assay were obtained from our laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample Preparation</title><p id="Par7">The genomic DNAs of all plant materials were extracted and purified using a mini-plant genomic DNA extraction kit (Shanghai Bio-ful Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The DNA concentration and quality were estimated using a NanoDrop 1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, LLC, Wilmington, DE). To test the 4-plex sensitivity, a series of DNA solution were obtained by mixing the GM maize flour with non-GM maize flour. The final relative content was 10%, 5%, 1% and 0.5% (w/w) for each of the four GM maizes, respectively. Event-specific genes of the four GM maize were used for the construction of standard plasmids as calibrators; plasmids were serially diluted from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> and amplified for quantitative detection. Easy dilution (TaKaRa biotechnology Co., Ltd, Dalian, China) was used to dilute the standard plasmids to avoid DNA loss due to adsorption to the tube walls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Set-up of EPFS Reaction</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>The Selection Principle of Fluorophores and Primer Labeling</title><p id="Par8">According to the experimental data and rigorous calculation supplied by ThermoFisher Scientific (ThermoFisher Scientific Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), when the stoke shift of a fluorophore was higher than the sum of excitation and emission bandwidth of the microplate reader, the optimal excitation and emission wavelength were set to get stronger signal and to prevent overlap. Based on the parameter characteristics of the multi-mode microplate reader Varioskan Flash reader (Thermo Scientific), the excitation bandwidth was 5&#x02009;nm and the emission bandwidth was 12&#x02009;nm. Consequently, the fluorophores with stokes shift that was &#x0003e;17&#x02009;nm, were more easy to detect. Furthermore, the excitation spectrum and the emission spectrum of two adjacent fluorophores should not overlap.</p><p id="Par9">Based on the above listed principles, twelve fluorophores were selected among 300 fluorophores. Almost 20 fluorophores can be tested simultaneously without affecting the fluorescence strength and sensitivity when the excitation and emission wavelength are properly adjusted. In this study, four fluorophores were elaborately selected. In addition, four pairs of GM maize primers and foodborne pathogenic bacteria primers were labeled with the selected fluorophores and synthesized (ThermoFisher Scientific Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) to amplify the targeted DNA. A pair of primers of internal reference gene (IVR) of maize were also labeled with another fluorophore for detection of the simulated samples.

A series of standard samples (serially diluted plasmids) were detected to construct the standard curve for quantitative analysis of the unknown samples. A gradient of standard samples and concentration was set and the linear regression analysis, the correlation coefficient and blank reduction were adopted to provide a net RFU increase which were supposed to be proportional to DNA copies in the resulting products.

The sensitivity and specificity of the system were examined using four kinds of GM maize. By labeling different gene-specific primer pairs with different fluorophores that did not interfere with each other, multiple target DNAs could be co-amplified in a single PCR reaction, and amplicons could be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with high throughput. The EPFS method showed high sensitivity (0.5% (w/w)) which was below the standard levels proposed by EU criteria. In addition, excellent linearity relationship between the logarithm of RFU values and gene copy numbers were detected, and the absolute LOD of EPFS was 10<sup>3</sup> copies. The 4-plex method increased the throughput via emulsion PCR reaction but without compromising the quality of resulting data. The slight deviation between the calculated GM contents and simulated GM contents confirmed the precision and accuracy of this EPFS method. Furthermore, the qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput detection results obtained from four foodborne pathogenic bacteria further confirmed the applicability of EPFS method to other biological samples.</p><p id="Par35">The excellence of EPFS method can be attributed to the combination of emulsion PCR and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Emulsion PCR can improve the throughput, thus avoiding constraints of multiple PCRs by partitioning the reaction mixture into discrete droplets while maintaining the specificity and sensitivity. Emulsion PCR was first systematically described by Williams <italic>et al</italic>. who have amplified complex DNA mixtures by compartmentalization of genes in water-in oil (w/o) emulsion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Emulsion PCR method consists of emulsion PCR and analysis of the products. Williams and his team have used agarose gel electrophoresis to analyze the PCR products; nonetheless, their method could only be used for qualitative analysis but not for quantitative determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the contamination derived from the agarose gel electrophoresis appeared to be defective. Later on, Guo <italic>et al</italic>. have used microdreoplet PCR implemented capillary gel electrophoresis to amplify and analyze multiple DNA targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; however, their two-step PCR method containing preamplification PCR and emulsion PCR has shown to be relatively complicated and not suitable for quantitative determination. Droplet digital PCR enables absolute quantitation of low copy number nucleic acid samples with an automated droplet generator; though, the low throughput and high cost hamper its widespread use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the present study, we combined the emulsion PCR with fluorescence spectrophotometry to amplify and analyze multiple targeted DNA qualitatively and quantitatively with high throughput at reasonable cost. The emulsion PCR products were directly measured by Infinite M1000 PRO to avoid the contamination derived from the agarose gel electrophoresis. Conventional PCR could only be used for qualitative detection, but not for quantitative detection, and the throughput was limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. While real-time quantitative PCR enables quantitative detection with low LOD and high accuracy, its throughput is incomplete due to limited detecting channels in real-time systerm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The EPFS method used Infinite M1000 PRO to measure the RFU of the fluorophore, which can detect the emission wavelength from 200&#x02009;nm to 1000&#x02009;nm (Thermo VarioSkan Flash), i.e. 12 fluorophores can be analyzed in a well. With appropriate adjustment, almost 20 fluoropores could be tested simultaneously in a well, which means more than 6000 genes could be detected in a 384-well plate at a time. Therefore, our EPFS method could detect abundant target genes simultaneously.</p><p id="Par36">DNA microarray is suitable for high-throughput and qualitative analysis, but not for quantitative assay due to the poor linearity. In addition, preparation of high-density array is time consuming and the confocal laser scanner is very expensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the process of amplification using microarray, it was easy to contaminate the target samples thus affecting signal-to-noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. By contrast, EPFS method only requires conventional thermocycle instrument and a fluoro-microplate reader (or fluorospectrophotometer) to qualitatively and quantitatively detect multiple target DNAs with high throughput, clearly indicating its simplicity, speediness, concision and low cost.</p><p id="Par37">Many emulsion PCR techniques have currently adopted a known instrumentation and technologies for DNA analysis, such as agarose gel electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, microarray<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, capillary electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and micro-fluidic chip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, the new EPFS system is the first analytical technology of this kind that enables simultaneous qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput analysis of multiple genes. The excellent performance of the EPFS method enables its application in the field of animal husbandry, including the detection of veterinary pathogenic microorganisms, human pathogenic microorganisms, aquatic pathogenic microorganisms, environmental and plant pathogenic microbes. The EPFS method could also be used for detection of varieties of human disease-related genes and genetic counseling. The excellent performance of EPFS system described in this study is still dimmed by the manual purification of emulsion products. This, however, can be improved with the use of automatic purification system, by which time the repeatability and accuracy should be greatly improved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
