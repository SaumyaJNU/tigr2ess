However, only limited resources are available on the phylogenesis and functions of this gene family in wheat. Here, a total of 46 NOX family genes were identified in the wheat genome, and these NOXs could be classified into three subgroups: typical TaNOXs, TaNOX-likes, and ferric reduction oxidases (TaFROs). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the typical TaNOXs might originate from TaFROs during evolution, and the TaFROs located on Chr 2 might be the most ancient forms of TaNOXs. TaNOXs are highly expressed in wheat with distinct tissue or organ-specificity and stress-inducible diversity. A large-scale expression and/or coexpression analysis demonstrated that TaNOXs can be divided into four functional groups with different expression patterns under a broad range of environmental stresses. Different TaNOXs are coexpressed with different sets of other genes, which widely participate in several important intracellular processes such as cell wall biosynthesis, defence response, and signal transduction, suggesting their vital but diversity of roles in plant growth regulation and stress responses of wheat.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>)</kwd><kwd>NADPH oxidases</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>abiotic/biotic stress response</kwd><kwd>coexpression analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">160</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="78"/><page-count count="20"/><word-count count="11760"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have dual roles in plant growth regulation and environmental stress response. They not only lead to programmed cell death by damaging the cellular components as deleterious factors of oxidative metabolism but are also necessary for plant tolerance to different biotic and abiotic stresses acting as signal molecules (Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dietz et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although there are various ROS-generating pathways in plants, the plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (NOXs), also named after respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), were considered to be the key enzymes for apoplastic ROS production under both normal and stress conditions and play crucial roles in various biological processes in plants.</p><p>NOX homologs are universally present in a broad range of organisms including animals, higher plants, and fungi (Bedard et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Until recently, various types of NOXs including the ancestral NOXs, namely ferric reductases (FREs) or ferric reduction oxidases (FROs), were reported in life kingdom with four types. These types were NOXA, NOXB, NOXC, and FRE in fungi (Aguirre et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). There were also seven types including NOX1&#x02013;5, DUOX1, and DUOX2 in animals (Bedard et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and one type in plants known as NOX5-Like (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Although the first NOX gene <italic>OsRbohA</italic> (<italic>OsNOX2</italic>) was characterized as a gp91<sup>phox</sup> homolog of mammalian NOX in rice, multiple NOX members were identified in plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), rice (Wang et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), maize (Potock&#x000fd; et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), tobacco (Yoshioka et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), potato (Yoshioka et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), tomato (Amicucci et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (Marino et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> (Nestler et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and more than 50 FRO and 77 NOX gene homologs were identified (Chang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). All the plant NOX members are NOX5-like homologs except the ancestral NOXs (FROs), which were considered as the isoforms of yeast FREs (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bedard et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In addition to having their special NADPH_Ox domain and several calcium-binding EF-hand motifs in its N terminus, the NOX5-like homologs in plants also contain membrane-spanning domains, two hemes, NADPH-binding motifs, and FAD-binding motifs just like all the other NOX/DUOX enzymes in animals (Geiszt, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Many plants have multiple NOX members, and each member has its own special function during the growth and development regulation and stress response. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are 10 typical NOX members reported as AtRbohA&#x02013;J (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Among these NOXs, AtRbohD was found to participate in various important processes including abscisic acid-mediated ROS production and stomatal closure (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), lignin assembly (Denness et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), endosperm development (Penfield et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) as well as in systemic signal transduction, (Miller et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and survival of seedlings under anoxic conditions (Yamauchi et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, it was reported that AtRbohB mainly participates in seed after ripening (Muller et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), AtRbohC regulates root hair formation and root-hair-cell growth (Takeda et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), whereas both AtRbohD and AtRbohF not only regulate the immune response (Chaouch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and salt stress tolerance (Xie et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) but also function in jasmonic acid (JA)-induced gene expression (Maruta et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, AtRbohE was found to regulate tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen development (Xie et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), whereas AtRbohH and AtRbohJ function in pollen tube development (Kaya et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In rice, at least nine typical NOX members were identified to be of OsRbohA&#x02013;I or OsNOX1&#x02013;9 (Wong et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It was found that OsRbohA (OsNOX2), OsRbohB (OsNOX1), and OsRbohE (OsNOX3) are involved in immune response (Yoshie et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Nagano et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and OsRbohA (OsNOX2) also plays a crucial role in drought-stress tolerance (Wang et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most recently, OsRbohH (OsNOX9) was found to regulate the aerenchyma formation in roots of rice (Yamauchi et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In maize, both ZmRbohH (ZmNOX13) and ROOTHAIRLESS5 (ZmNOX7) were found to function in root development (Rajhi et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Nestler et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, increasing evidence shows that NOXs in plants may serve as molecular &#x0201c;hubs&#x0201d; during ROS-mediated signal transduction pathways (Marino et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), including receptor-activated C-kinases (RACKs) (Nakashima et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) (Dubiella et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Asai et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), phospholipase D&#x003b1;1 and phosphatidic acid (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Wudick and Feijo, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), phosphatidylinositol (Kaye et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), NO (Delledonne et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), cGMP (Li et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and extracellular ATP-mediated signaling pathways (Song et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and hormonal signaling networks (Mittler et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Furthermore, AtRbohD was found to participate in the clathrin- and membrane microdomain-dependent endocytic pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Hao et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although previous studies have highlighted the biochemical properties and physiological functions of NOXs to a certain degree, considering the multiple members in different plant species in which only a few of NOXs were studied in detail, the functions of NOX family proteins are still under investigation.</p><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is a worldwide staple crop, necessitating a clear deciphering of its developmental characteristics and stress tolerance mechanisms. However, as of today, only two NOXs in wheat have been reported to participate in brown rust infection response (Dmochowska-Boguta et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and the functions of wheat NOX family genes and their regulatory mechanisms in both plant growth regulation and environmental stress response are still largely unknown. In the present study, a comprehensive analysis based on bioinformatics approaches and experimental methods was performed to identify the wheat NOX family genes and their functions during the plant development and stress response. The results obtained here will largely broaden our understanding of the roles of NOXs and their regulation in plants, especially in wheat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sequence retrieval and identification of the NOX gene family in wheat</title><p>We retrieved the potential sequences of NOX family members in wheat from IWGSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wheatgenome.org/">http://www.wheatgenome.org/</ext-link>, last accessed May 25, 2017), NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>, last accessed May 25, 2017), and Ensembl Plants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index">http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index</ext-link>, last accessed May 25, 2017) websites, with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice NOX sequences as queries.

These NOX and FRO candidates can be divided into three types: TaNOXs, TaNOX-likes, and TaFROs based on their chromosome localization and domain composition (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The homologous genes from different subgenomes (A, B, and D) were assigned the same number in gene denomination due to their similarity in gene structure and protein size. The typical NOXs (TaNOXs) have all four conserved domains, namely NADPH_Ox (Pfam accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="PF08414">PF08414</ext-link>), Ferric_reduct (<ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="PF01794">PF01794</ext-link>), FAD_binding_8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="PF08022">PF08022</ext-link>), and NAD_binding_6 domain (<ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="PF08022">PF08022</ext-link>). The TaNOX-likes have NADPH_Ox domain but lack one or two other domains, whereas the TaFROs lack NADPH_Ox domain but have the other three domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Intriguingly, the NOX and FRO family genes in wheat genome are non randomly distributed across the chromosomes. It seems that FRO candidates are mainly distributed on Chr 2 and less on Chr 1; however, all the predicted NOX candidates are mainly distributed on Chr 1, followed by Chr 5, 3, 4, and 6, and none of the NOX members on Chr 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Moreover, the characteristics of gene structure and protein size are quite different between the NOX and FRO members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).

On the whole, the gene constructions became more and more complicated from <italic>TaFROs</italic> to <italic>TaNOXs</italic> for increasing exons and introns. As a special type of NOX, <italic>TaNOX-likes</italic> are much simple with less exons and introns. According to the phylogenetic tree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), we found that all the homologous genes assigned as the same number in gene denomination were generally clustered into one group earlier than the others, and all the NOX family members could be classified into three big branches: FRO I (including TaFRO3 and 4) on the Chr 2, FRO II (including TaFRO1 and 2) on the Chr 1, and NOX (including TaNOXs and TaNOX-likes) on the Chr 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, almost all the typical NOXs contain one or two transmembrane regions, one to four calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, and four conserved constructions, namely one or two typical NADPH_Ox domain, one Ferric_reduction domain, one FAD_binding_8 domain, and one NAD_binding_6 domain. Only TaNOX14 does not have an EF-hand motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). All TaFROs possess the conserved domains that the typical TaNOXs have but lack the NADPH_Ox domain and the EF-hand motif. In contrast, the TaNOX-likes have only one or two of the three conserved domains similar to TaFROs possession, besides the typical NADPH_Ox and EF-hand motifs. Furthermore, the four functional domains exhibited to be all considerably conserved in construction, and the distribution of amino acid residues in every domain is quite similar but not identical among the NOX members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Four conservative amino acid residues Y, G, G, and P presented with Y &#x000d7; &#x000d7; G &#x000d7; G &#x000d7; &#x000d7; P motif in the 5&#x02032;end sequence of NAD_binding_6 domain from TaFROs were the same as those from the TaNOXs and TaNOX-likes. There were also other quite conserved residues, for example, the P in FAD_binding_8 domain and the G in Ferric_reduct domain, as indicated in capital letters in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>. However, the conservatism of amino acid residues in NADPH _Ox domain was lower than the other three conserved domains. Taken together, all the results mentioned above imply a closer evolutionary relationship between TaFROs and TaNOXs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of the wheat NOX family proteins</title><p>As shown in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, all the NOXs including TaNOXs, TaNOX-likes, and TaFROs are located in the plasma membrane of cells as predicted by the Plant-mPLoc.

The elements responsive to environmental stresses and hormones were considered for further analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). As can be seen, almost all the stress or hormone responsive elements are distributed randomly on the promoter sequences of the <italic>TaNOX</italic> genes.

Interestingly, the numbers and distribution patterns of the cis-elements are also greatly varied among the promoters of homologous genes with the same number in gene denomination although their encoding proteins have an extreme similarity in amino acids sequence and domain construction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

The activities of almost all the promoters of seven TaNOX genes could be greatly stimulated by heat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), whereas no marked changes in the activities were observed under cold stress compared with the controls.

Here, only a more than two-fold difference in transcript levels was considered to be a true difference for the genes under treatments. Under cold (4&#x000b0;C) stress, most TaNOX genes were downregulated in both shoots and roots at 12 and 24 h time points of the treatment, whereas <italic>TaNOX7</italic> was upregulated in roots at 12 h time point. Similarly, most of the genes were downregulated by salt stress (200 mM NaCl) in both shoots and roots at 12 h and/or 24 h time point, whereas <italic>TaNOX5</italic> was upregulated in roots at 12 h time point. However, heat stress (40&#x000b0;C) markedly upregulated the transcript levels of <italic>TaNOX3, 8, 11</italic>, and <italic>15</italic> genes but downregulated <italic>TaNOX2, 5, 7, 10</italic>, and <italic>12</italic> genes in shoots. In contrast, except for <italic>TaNOX12</italic> and <italic>13</italic>, almost all the other genes examined were downregulated by heat in roots (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3B</xref>).

Furthermore, except <italic>TaNOX7</italic>, which showed no changes, and <italic>TaNOX12</italic>, which was upregulated, all the other genes were downregulated by ABA treatment (100 &#x003bc;M) in shoots, whereas except <italic>TaNOX5</italic>, which was greatly upregulated, and <italic>TaNOX12</italic> and <italic>13</italic>, which were downregulated, all the others showed no obvious changes in roots.

Although not all the NOX family genes were examined, the results obtained here suggested that each NOX member in wheat has its unique inducible expression profiles and thus has its own functional specificity in the plant stress responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Coexpression relationships between the genes of <italic>TaNOXs</italic> and others</title><p>To further explore the biological functions of TaNOX genes, we generated the coexpression patterns of <italic>TaNOXs</italic> with others using the wheat microarray data in the database of Ta_mRNASeq_WHEAT_GL-0 from Genevestigator v3 (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>). Eight genes were selected for the analysis according to their inducible expression profiles. Interestingly, several genes showed obvious coexpression relationships with certain NOX genes either at 10 different developmental stages (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>) or in 22 different tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). These coexpressed genes are mainly involved in the substance transport, cell wall synthesis, redox reaction, phosphorylation, and/or gene expression regulation (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). For instance, <italic>TaNOX2</italic> and <italic>3</italic> showed positive correlation with the genes encoding two S-locus lectin protein kinase family proteins; <italic>TaNOX3, 7</italic>, and <italic>TaFRO3</italic> are coexpressed with the genes encoding four leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family proteins. The eight NOX genes also exhibited distinct coexpression with other genes under a lot of biotic and abiotic stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>). These coexpression genes are widely involved in stress response, signal transduction, cell wall formation, protein degradation, substance transport, and transcriptional regulation (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). For example, <italic>TaNOX2</italic> is highly coexpressed with a gene encoding <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine-dependent methyltransferase and a gene encoding ubiquitin-specific protease family C19-related protein, whereas <italic>TaNOX3</italic> is highly coexpressed with the genes encoding two brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1 precursor kinases and a gene encoding glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase tau 7.</p><p>To better understand the coexpression relationships of the <italic>TaNOXs</italic> with other genes under abiotic stresses, we chose some genes as targets for qRT-PCR. According to the results of tissue and inducible expression profiles, five TaNOX genes and six stress conditions were selected for the experiment. Here, more than two fold difference in transcript levels was considered to be a true difference for the genes as well. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, most of the genes selected exhibited significant coexpression patterns with the <italic>TaNOXs</italic> under a certain stress condition. Only a few genes had an opposite response with the <italic>TaNOX</italic> gene under some special stress. As can be seen, <italic>TaNOX2</italic> exhibited an opposite response with its predicted coexpression genes only under salt stress. For <italic>TaNOX3</italic>, except under drought and MeJA treatments, it seems that only one predicted gene was not obviously coexpressed with it under four other stress conditions. The distinct coexpression relationships between <italic>TaNOX7</italic> and the predicted genes could be observed under heat, natural drying, and ABA treatments. By contrast, <italic>TaNOX8</italic> exhibited positive coexpression with the predicted genes under all the six stress treatments. Except drought and salt stresses, <italic>TaNOX12</italic> also showed obvious coexpression with its predicted genes examined under other four treatments.

In this study, a total of 46 NOX family genes, which encode 15 TaNOXs, 4 TaNOX-likes, and 4 TaFROs, were identified according to the sequence analysis and domain composition (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the homologous genes from different subgenomes for a certain NOX protein always clustered together first, as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, not every protein has three homologous genes distributed on the subchromosomes A, B, and D. For example, TaNOX3 includes two homologous genes (<italic>TaNOX3-1BL</italic> and <italic>-1DL</italic>) but <italic>TaNOX4</italic> has only one (<italic>TaNOX4-1DL</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This means that their homologs on a certain subchromosome might be lost during the long-term evolution and natural selection. In fact, many previous studies have shown that in an allopolyploid species, the phenomenon of genovariation including gene rearrangement, structural variation, DNA sequence loss or amplification, and transposon activation occurred frequently during the polyploidization of genome (Jackson and Chen, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>As suggested earlier, gene duplication, fusion, and/or exon shuffling are commonly occurred in eukaryotes for the biological diversity and functional divergence of certain gene family during evolution in plants (Morgante et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Van de Peer et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kaessmann, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Magadum et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This is also involved in the expansion of NOX gene family in plants (Chang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The typical NOXs of wheat exhibited high similarity in the sequences of the conserved domains but obvious diversity in gene structure and protein size (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). TaFROs also showed very high similarity in sequences of the conserved domains compared with those of TaNOXs although there are still some differences in same conserved amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), implying an evolutionary relationship between TaFROs and TaNOXs. In fact, it was suggested that FRO proteins are the ancestral forms of NOXs in both animals and plants (Chang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly, although the structures of TaNOXs and TaFROs are conserved, they have undergone a diverse structural evolution. It can be seen that the numbers and positions of intron and exon of the genes became more and more complicated from TaFROs to TaNOXs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), exhibiting a structural diversity of NOX family genes in wheat, and the evolutionary mechanisms such as gene duplication, gene fusion, and exon shuffling might be also involved in the evolution of wheat NOX gene family. Moreover, although TaFROs are the ancient forms of TaNOXs, the <italic>TaFROs</italic> genes located on Chr 1 and Chr 2 seem to be somewhat different in evolution and function. The <italic>TaFROs</italic> located on Chr 1 (<italic>TaFRO1</italic> and <italic>TaFRO2</italic>) and Chr 2 (<italic>TaFRO3</italic> and <italic>TaFRO4</italic>) could not be clustered into the same subgroup within the phylogenetic tree. The <italic>TaFROs</italic> located on Chr 1 were clustered into the small subgroup and were closer to the <italic>TaNOXs</italic> and <italic>TaNOX-likes</italic> than the <italic>TaFROs</italic> located on Chr 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), indicating their differential but complicated evolution of the two types of TaFROs. The TaFROs encoded by the genes located on Chr 2 exhibited different numbers and arrangement of transmembrane regions and different sizes of the three conserved domains compared with those located on Chr 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), showing their diversity in protein structure and probably also in function. Moreover, it seems that the arrangement and similarity of Ferric_reduct domains and transmembrane regions of the TaFROs encoded by the genes located on Chr 1 are more similar to those of the typical TaNOXs, further suggesting that the TaFROs encoded by the genes located on Chr 1 perhaps are closer to TaNOXs in genetics than those on Chr 2 and the TaFROs on Chr 2 might be the more ancient forms of TaNOXs in wheat.</p><p>As reported earlier, typical NOXs only exist in terrestrial plants evolved from the ancient FROs by gaining a NADPH_Ox domain (Chang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The NADPH_Ox domain endowed NOX with a new function of producing ROS as a defence mechanism. Although the FROs in lower organisms are responsible for both ROS production and iron uptake (Aguirre et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), a number of increasing literatures have shown that in higher plants, NOX-mediated ROS production is mainly responsible for the stress tolerance and development regulation (Kaya et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gupta et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Yamauchi et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), whereas FROs are mainly responsible for iron uptake and iron homeostasis (Sperotto et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, TaNOXs perhaps will become more complicated in construction; for example, TaNOX3 possessing two NADPH_Ox domains, and this is different from the others that just possesses one NADPH_Ox domain in animo acid sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Further study is needed to check whether it has some biological significance.</p><p>The four TaNOX-likes are very special because they have the NADPH_Ox domain but lack one or two other conserved domains that the typical TaNOXs have (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and although no typical transmembrane helixes were identified in these proteins, they are also located in the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The analysis for phylogenetic relationships showed that TaNOX-like1 and 3 are much closer to TaNOX4, whereas TaNOX-like2 is much closer to TaNOX3 and TaNOX-like4 is much closer to TaNOX15 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), indicating that they might derive from these three typical TaNOXs, respectively, probably by DNA sequence loss during evolution. As no NOX-like proteins were identified in other plant species and no experiments have been done on them, their biological functions are unclear. All this information suggest that wheat NOXs underwent a complicated evolutionary history during the gene expansion and functional divergence.</p></sec><sec><title>Wheat NOXs exhibit a great specificity in expression and play vital roles in both the plant growth regulation and stress response</title><p>Specific expression is a common characteristic of the genes of a certain protein family in plants, which often reflects the cross-talk and/or difference in functions of the family members. Many studies have shown that different NOXs have different functions both in animals and in plants (Bedard and Krause, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kaye et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 10 NOXs were found, and these NOXs participate in different biological processes and/or stress responses with obvious tissue specificity in the gene expression (Maruta et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Chaouch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kaya et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Xie et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, in wheat, although it was reported that NOXs could ameliorate the nickel-induced oxidative stress (Hao et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), to date, only two genes have been reported functioning in brown rust infection (Dmochowska-Boguta et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the present study, both the results obtained from database research and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that TaNOXs widely function in the plant growth regulation and stress response (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, <italic>TaNOX2</italic> is expressed in a whole plant with dominantly existing in stem elongation and inflorescence emergence stages, and its transcripts were greatly affected by a set of biotic and abiotic stresses, implying its vital roles in plant growth regulation and also stress responses. TaNOX2 is more similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtRbohD and AtRbohF and rice OsNOX2 (OsRbohA) in phylogenetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). AtRbohD and AtRbohF are all expressed throughout the plant (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and are essential not only for the hypersensitive response but also for the ABA-, JA-, and ethylene-induced signaling pathways (Suhita et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Desikan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Maruta et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), disease resistance (Chaouch et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), salt stress tolerance (Xie et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and endosperm development (Penfield et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). <italic>OsNOX2</italic> was also found to be expressed in the whole plant and plays crucial roles in both growth regulation and drought stress tolerance (Wang et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). TaNOX8 and TaNOX12 are also much close to AtRbohD, AtRbohF, and OsNOX2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and as expected, the two wheat genes exhibit very similar expression profiles with <italic>TaNOX2</italic>, although they are somewhat different under a certain stress condition, implying their functional identity or coordination. In contrast, <italic>TaNOX3</italic> showed marked tissue and/or development specific expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with a great response for many different treatments (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, <bold>8</bold>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), suggesting somewhat specificity in functions. TaNOX3 is much closer to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtRbohB, which was found to be specifically expressed in root and elongation zone and to be involved in seed after ripening (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Muller et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Similar to TaNOX3, the TaNOXs including TaNOX4, 9, 10, and 11 are also much closer to AtRbohB in phylogenetics, but these TaNOXs exhibit varied tissue and/or development expression profiles as well as the inducible expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), implying somewhat divergence in functions among these NOX proteins. <italic>TaNOX15</italic> also shows notable tissue- and development-specific expression with more transcripts in stems at booting stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), but the transcripts were less induced by different treatments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). TaNOX15 has high identity in amino acid sequence with Arabdopsis AtRbohC, which was reported participating in root-hair-tip growth and specifically expressed in roots (Sagi and Fluhr, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Takeda et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), which means that it has different functions in wheat as AtRbohC has in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Expression specificity and functional diversity of TaNOXs in wheat.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>TaNOXs</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Tissue specificty</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Expression level</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Functions and sensibility</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TaNOX1</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Booting;

It was reported that OsNOX1 (OsRbohB) involves in immune response (Nagano et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), whereas OsNOX9 (OsRbohH) regulates the ethylene-induced aerenchyma formation in roots (Yamauchi et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Furthermore, TaNOX1 and TaNOX5 are much closer to OsNOX3, which was also found to play crucial roles in plant immune response (Yoshie et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Nagano et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). TaNOX1 and TaNOX5 having similar functions require further study. Interestingly, due to the inducible expression profiles under a set of biotic and abiotic stresses, all the TaNOXs could be divided into four subgroups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), implying their functional divergence between the groups but coordination within the same group. However, as discussed above, different TaNOXs exhibit strong spatio-temporal and tissue-specific expressions, demonstrating an obvious cross-talk and/or divergence in both biological roles and evolutionary relationship of the NOX family genes in wheat.</p></sec><sec><title>Coexpression analysis reveals the wide functions but complicated regulatory mechanisms of the TaNOXs in wheat</title><p>Acting as the key producer of ROS, NOXs play vital roles in plant growth and development including root and root hair elongation (Foreman et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), endosperm development (Penfield et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), cellular vesicle cycle (Hao et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), seed after ripening (Muller et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), pollen tube growth, lipid microdomain polarization (Potock&#x000fd; et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hao et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Nagano et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), plant-rhizobial symbiosis (Marino et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and also stress responses as reviewed previously (Chang et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The functional diversity was also observed in the wheat NOX gene family as discussed above. The results from our thorough coexpression analysis showed that different TaNOXs have different sets of coexpression genes against development stages, tissues, or stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), implying the specific but complicated functions of NOX proteins in wheat development regulation and/or stress responses.</p><p>Corresponding to the developmental stages and tissue specificity, the coexpression genes with <italic>TaNOXs</italic> are mainly related to enzymatic glycosyl transfer, energy metabolism, substrate transport, cell wall synthesis, redox reaction, phosphorylation, and/or gene expression regulation (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), suggesting their diverse and vital function in wheat development. For example, <italic>TaNOX2</italic> is highly coexpressed with a kinase (casein kinase 1.5) and two cellulose synthases (CESA3 and CESA5) in all the tissues examined, implying that its function may be tightly related to the cell wall synthesis and protein phosphorylation. Casein kinase 1 (CK1) plays a crucial role in regulating growth and development via phosphorylating various substrates throughout the eukaryote kingdom. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, two CK1s were found to regulate blue light signaling by phosphorylating cryptochrome 2 (Tan et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). CESA3 and CESA5 are two important proteins functioning in plant cell wall formation (Griffiths et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and also in fiber cellulose production (Li et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Several RLK family genes and a phytosulfokin receptor 1 gene were found to have significant coexpression with <italic>TaNOX3</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), demonstrating that TaNOX3 might participate in a series of cellular signaling pathways. As reported earlier, RLKs play crucial roles in plant growth, development, and defence response by perceiving and transmitting extracellular or intracellular signals (Wu and Zhou, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As the receptor of phytosulfokine (PSK), the phytosulfokin receptor 1 functions in cell growth, pollen tube guidance, and cell differentiation (Sauter, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Several heavy metal transport-related proteins and DHHC-type zinc finger family proteins are highly coexpressed with TaNOX7 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), implying its functions in substrate transport and protein anchoring to the membrane. DHHC-type zinc finger family proteins were found to play crucial roles in protein palmitoylation for cell membrane anchoring (Mitchell et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Besides being coexpressed with two CESA1-cellulose synthases, TaNOX8 also has high coexpression with a SCAMP family protein and two kinesin motor family proteins, indicating that it might not only participate in cell wall biosynthesis but also function in intracellular substance transport. SCAMP family proteins acting as carriers are responsible for the protein transport functioning to the cell surface in post-Golgi recycling pathways (Fernandez-Chacon et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), and kinesin family proteins unidirectionally transport various cargos including membranous organelles, protein complexes, and mRNA (Li et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). TaNOX12, however, is highly coexpressed with several glycosyl transfer-related proteins, demonstrating their roles in enzymatic glycosyl transfer. Moreover, two riboflavin synthase-like superfamily proteins have high coexpression with TaNOX12. Riboflavin synthases are responsible for the biosynthesis of vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, which is vital for the cellular redox balance (Fischer and Bacher, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). TaNOX13 is coexpressed with three CESA proteins and one CK1 protein, suggesting its functions in the cell wall formation and protein phosphorylation. It should be noticed that TaNOX12 has obvious coexpression with TaNOX2 and TaNOX8 at different development stages and in different tissues (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>), showing somewhat cross-talk between the function of different TaNOXs. All these results indicate the distinct but crossing functions of the TaNOXs in wheat growth and development.</p><p>The coexpression patterns of TaNOXs with other genes are greatly affected by different stresses, and different sets of genes were found to be highly coexpressed with the TaNOXs under stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), showing the vital roles of TaNOXs with complicated regulatory mechanisms during their functioning in stress tolerance. The genes that are highly coexpressed with TaNOXs under stress conditions are widely involved in stress signal transduction, cell wall formation, protein degradation, transcriptional regulations, and so on. Among the eight TaNOXs examined here, four genes including <italic>TaNOX2, 3, 8</italic>, and <italic>13</italic> have distinct coexpression with the genes encoding several protein degradation-related proteins including one ubiquitin-specific protease family C19-related protein, two ARM repeat superfamily proteins, one RING/U-box superfamily protein, and five COP1-interacting protein-related proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). All these coexpressed proteins function as E3 ubiquitin ligase or involve in ubiquitination of proteins (Zeng et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Acosta et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), implying these TaNOXs might participate in protein degradation in wheat under stress conditions. Furthermore, a set of signal transduction-related genes were found to be highly coexpressed with TaNOXs, especially under stress conditions. At first, it was found that the genes encoding five protein kinase superfamily proteins are highly coexpressed with the TaNOXs, including TaNOX2, 7, and 13 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). These protein kinases, including an LRR family protein and two CC-NBS-LRR proteins, belong to receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) family, often functioning in signal transduction in plant cells, especially in the pathogen detection and defense response (Wu and Zhou, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that TaNOX3 is highly coexpressed with the genes encoding two BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) precursor kinases, and TaNOX7 is coexpressed with three PLC-like phosphodiesterases superfamily proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). BRI1 is a key component in brassinosteroid (BR) perception and signal transduction and has a broad impact on plant growth and development (Oh et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Phospholipase C (PLC) is a class of membrane-associated enzymes playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways (Singh et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Our results obtained here have given much cues for the functions of TaNOXs and the possible working mechanism in stress tolerance but needs further investigation.</p><p>The coexpression of TaNOXs with several CESA proteins is another interesting event, especially under stress conditions. A total of nine CESA cellulose synthases were found to be highly coexpressed with the TaNOXs including TaNOX2, 8, and 13 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>), indicating that these TaNOXs have important roles in cell wall formation both under normal and stress conditions. CESA cellulose synthases are the key enzymes for cellulose synthesis during the cell wall formation (Endler and Persson, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It was also proposed that ROS, such as superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide, function in cell wall loosing and stiffing, and in these processes, the NOX-mediated ROS production plays an important role (Karkonen and Kuchitsu, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the ROS production also plays a key role in the process of cell wall remodeling under abiotic stresses (Tenhaken, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). All of these results suggest that some complicated regulatory mechanisms might be involved in the developmental regulation and stress response of TaNOXs in wheat.</p><p>Several other stress response-related genes were also found to be highly coexpressed with certain TaNOXs, further demonstrating the wide functions but complicated regulatory mechanisms of the TaNOXs during the plant development and stress responses. For instance, TaNOX3 is coexpressed with glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase tau 7, and TaNOX13 has coexpression with NAD kinase 1 (NADK1). Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) is a multifunctional ROS scavenging enzyme that is involved in a variety of cellular processes. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a homolog of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase tau 7 was found to be related to detoxification, secondary metabolism, and stress responses to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (Fode et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). NADKs are the enzymes found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, generating pyridine nucleotide NADP(H) from substrates ATP and NAD(H). NADP(H) can be used as the electron donor to NOXs for generating ROS in plants (Turner et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, NADK1 was found to be induced by environmental stresses and participated in plant pathogen interaction (Berrin et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>TaNOXs</italic> including <italic>TaNOX7, 12</italic>, and <italic>13</italic> also exhibit high coexpression with the genes encoding two <italic>O</italic>-fucosyltransferase family proteins, one starch synthase 2, and two melibiase family proteins, respectively, which all play important roles in glycometabolism. All these results suggest that the TaNOXs themselves or with their coexpression genes, synergistically or antagonistically, display pleiotropic functions in a wide range of processes of substance and energy metabolism, detoxification, substance transport, development regulation, and defence response, again implying the specific but complicated functions of the NOX genes in the wheat development and/or stress responses.</p><p>Taken together, wheat has multiple members of NOXs with diverse but vital functions in plant growth and development regulation and stress responses. Every member of TaNOXs has its specific expression pattern and function. Meanwhile, the functions of each wheat NOX and its regulatory mechanism in development regulation and defence response are still unclear. The interactions among TaNOXs and other genes are still barely reported in detail. The results obtained have provided a valuable foundation for further exploring the functions of NOX genes in wheat and in other plants as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>K-MC proposed concept.
