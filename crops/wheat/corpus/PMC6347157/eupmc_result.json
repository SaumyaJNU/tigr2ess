    "Perception of inclination in the gravity field and perception of light direction are two important environmental signals implicated in the control of plant shape and habit. However, their quantitative study in light-grown plants remains a challenge. We present a novel method here to determine the sensitivities to gravitropism and phototropism. The method combines: (i) an original experimental device of isotropic light to disentangle gravitropic and phototropic plant responses; and (ii) model-assisted phenotyping using recent models of tropism perception-the AC model for gravitropism alone and the ArC model for gravitropism combined with phototropism. We first assessed the validity of the AC and ArC models on poplar, the classical species model for woody plants. We then tested the method on three woody species contrasted by their habit and tolerance to shade: poplar (Populus tremula*alba), oak (Quercus petraea) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). The method was found to be effective to quantitatively discriminate the tested species by their ratio of tropistic sensitivities. The method thus appears as an interesting tool to quantitatively determine tropistic sensitivities, a prerequisite for assessing the role of tropisms in the control of the variability of the habit and/or tolerance to shade of woody species in the future."
