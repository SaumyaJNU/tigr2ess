However, their quantitative study in light-grown plants remains a challenge. We present a novel method here to determine the sensitivities to gravitropism and phototropism. The method combines: (i) an original experimental device of isotropic light to disentangle gravitropic and phototropic plant responses; and (ii) model-assisted phenotyping using recent models of tropism perception&#x02014;the <italic>AC</italic> model for gravitropism alone and the <italic>ArC</italic> model for gravitropism combined with phototropism. We first assessed the validity of the <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic> models on poplar, the classical species model for woody plants. We then tested the method on three woody species contrasted by their habit and tolerance to shade: poplar (<italic>Populus</italic> tremula*alba), oak (<italic>Quercus petraea</italic>) and beech (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>). The method was found to be effective to quantitatively discriminate the tested species by their ratio of tropistic sensitivities. The method thus appears as an interesting tool to quantitatively determine tropistic sensitivities, a prerequisite for assessing the role of tropisms in the control of the variability of the habit and/or tolerance to shade of woody species in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-BSV7-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5612-9263</contrib-id><name><surname>Coutand</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR-11-BSV7-0012 TROPIC.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="28"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gravitropism and phototropism, the orientation of growth as a function of gravity and light, respectively, are two major processes implicated in the regulation of plant shape [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Their combination allows aerial organs to forage for light without losing mechanical stability [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This requirement is important for erect plants and obviously becomes crucial for trees in which the shoot system is perennial and eventually very large. Moreover, differences in tree shape and the reaction to canopy opening [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are often interpreted as resulting from different sensitivities to photo- and gravitropism. However, even if several molecular cross-talks between the gravitropic and phototropic pathways have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], very few quantitative studies have been conducted on the interaction between photo- and gravitropism and none provides numerical values of sensitivities to gravi- and phototropism for trees. This lack of data does not make it possible to compare the contribution of gravi- and phototropism between different tree species and thus prevents further advances in quantifying the contribution of gravi- and phototropism in the control of tree shape (habit) variability.</p><p>When plants are subjected to gravitropism, they tend to reach the Gravitropic Set-Point Angle (GSA) [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the GSA can be modulated by several cues, e.g., light direction [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Galland extended the concept of GSA to the cases where both gravi- and phototropism are active: plants tend to reach a photogravitropic equilibrium angle (PEA) determined both by gravity field and light direction [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Further revisiting of Galland&#x02019;s experiments by Moulia et al. using the formalized <italic>ArC</italic> model [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] led to the definition of the Photo-Gravitropic Set-Point Angle (PGSA) and its quantitative dependency on photo- and gravitropic sensitivities (but not on the initial tilting angle vs. gravity A<sub>0</sub>, in opposition to initial claims by Galland [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). However, the estimation of the PGSA and, finally, of the photo- and gravitropic sensitivities, have only been conducted so far in one set of experiments using <italic>Avena</italic> coleoptile under continuous light [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The lack of knowledge about photo*gravi tropic interplay is even worse for trees. To our knowledge, only two studies have investigated the phototropic movements of trees [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and demonstrated that phototropism exists in their radially growing zones (woody stems). The gravitropic movement of tree axes (trunk or branch) has received more interest. Nevertheless, emphasis has been placed on the production of reaction wood, a specialized wood that acts as a motor for the tropistic movement of the woody stems and that has consequences on the quality of wood in the lumber industry [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, no quantitative method is available to quantify tropistic tree sensitivities, which is a prerequisite for assessing the contribution and interaction of photo- and gravitropism in tree shape variability.</p><p>A quantitative study of the photo*gravi tropistic interactions in the driving of a tropistic movement faces two challenges:</p><p>The first challenge is experimental. Indeed, gravitropism and phototropism are not easy to disentangle, at least on Earth ground at 1g. Indeed, as soon as a tree is tilted, one side of the stem is more shaded than the other, which can induce phototropism. Symmetrically, as soon as a vertical tree is lit unilaterally, it bends towards the light, which can trigger gravitropism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209973.g001">Fig 1</xref>). An obvious way to address this dilemma is through spatial experiments in microgravity conditions [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or on 3D clinostats. However, this is not really feasible with trees large enough to undergo significant secondary growth, and devices that would make it possible to fully avoid this dilemma on Earth are lacking.</p><fig id="pone.0209973.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0209973.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Diagram explaining the interactions between gravitropism and phototropism in classical experiments dedicated to the study of gravitropism and phototropism.</title><p>A: In classical experiments, a plant is tilted from the vertical in order to study gravitropism. In this case, since the light is coming from the top, one side of the stem is shaded, which can induce a phototropic reaction. B: In classical experiments, a plant is lit unilaterally in order to study phototropism. Since the plant bends towards the unilateral light, the stem is curved and thus tilted, which can induce a possible counteractive movement due to gravitropism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0209973.g001"/></fig><p>The second challenge is that formalized modeling is required to analyze the interplay between growth, bending under self-weight and tropisms throughout the tropistic movement [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Starting with the pioneering model of Fournier et al. (1994) [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], down to the most recent ones by Coutand et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], several models of tree tropisms have been designed [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All of them have combined: (i) a mechano-biological module of the perception-based driving of the differentiation of reaction wood; and (ii) a biomechanical module of the motor process to compute successive shapes of an axis though the mechanical actions of the differentiation of reaction wood and of the changes in the axis geometry and mass due to growth in girth [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This distinction between perception-based driving and motor processes is crucial: indeed, differences in gravitropic sensitivity should not be confused with differences in motor efficiencies (like the one that can be achieved with changes in trunk diameter of wood stiffness [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). However, most of the research effort has focused on the motor module, taking into account: (i) spatial effects, i.e., asymmetric sections [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the heterogeneity of normal and tension wood; and (ii) time effects such as the effects of viscoelasticity and the maturation process [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, in all these models, the perception-based driving module is very simple: local inclination from the vertical is perceived all along the trunk and reaction wood is produced in a given cross-section as long as the tree has not reached the vertical position (horizontal cross-section). Models including such a basic perception-based driving module all failed to predict the anticipated decurving of the axis observed on <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and on <italic>Populus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as in the coleoptile of wheat <italic>Triticum aestivum L</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Bastien et al. concentrated on the perception-based driving processes during gravitropism and gravitropism combined with phototropism, and provided two novel models of tropistic driving (<italic>AC</italic> model [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) and <italic>ArC</italic> model, [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). They then assessed their models with experiments in which the motor process actuating the movements could be assumed to be non-limiting, mostly in herbs. The <italic>AC</italic> model has been validated on 11 species, constituting a sample of the phylogeny of land angiosperms. This made it possible to simulate the anticipated decurving process observed in pine [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], poplar [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], wheat and other species [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, this validation was generally achieved on the steady-state shape of the plants and mostly for herbaceous species. The only woody plants that were assessed in [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were two-year-old poplars (data from Coutand et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]), but the assessment of <italic>AC</italic> on poplar was less complete since the achievement of a steady state was not fully assessed. The <italic>ArC</italic> model has only been assessed in one herbaceous species, <italic>Avena sativa</italic> L (and only on the coleoptile of its seedling).</p><p>In this work, we propose an original method to compute gravitropic and phototropic sensitivities of trees. Two dedicated experimental devices were designed and built expressly for the development of this method. One, fully original, was dedicated to disentangling gravitropism from phototropism: it makes it possible to tilt young trees in an isotropic light environment, thus triggering the gravitropic response alone. The other is more classical and combines plant tilting and unilateral lightening to study the interaction between gravi- and phototropism. In both set-ups, kinematics of tropistic movements were recorded and fully quantified.</p><p>Using these experimental set-ups, we first assessed the validity of the <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic> models for young trees. We then used model-assisted phenotyping with <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic> models to determine gravitropic and phototropic sensitivities of tree seedlings. In this exploratory work, the method was tested on three hardwood species that exhibited different behavior to light and type of growth: poplar (pioneer species, fast growth), oak (hemi-tolerance to shade, rhythmic growth) [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and beech (high tolerance to shade, slow growth) [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in order to illustrate the ability of the method to discriminate the three species on the basis of their tropistic sensitivities.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plants</title><p>Very young trees at a stage in which the shoot is about 30- to 50-cm-long were chosen because at this stage, the motor process is likely to be non-limiting and gravi- and photogravitropic equilibrium can be reached within a few weeks [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Poplar: Young poplars (<italic>Populus tremula &#x000d7; alba</italic> cv 717 1B4) were obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> micropropagation and planted in individual 5-L pots filled with loam after progressive acclimation.

Two months after micropropagation, the poplars were ready to be used in experiments; stems were at least 35-cm high at this stage.</p><p>Beech and oak: One-year-old beech and oak seedlings were purchased in a commercial nursery and planted in individual pots filled with 1/3 black peat and 2/3 local &#x0201c;Limagne&#x0201d; soil in autumn 2013 and 2014 and grown in a greenhouse. Watering was ensured on immersion tables. Beech seedlings were protected from direct sun by 55% shade cloth (Puteaux SA, Les Clayes sous Bois, France).</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Experimental devices to study tropistic responses</title><p>We designed and constructed novel experimental devices called &#x0201c;isotropic light spheres&#x0201d; to disentangle gravitropism and phototropism. These spherical growth cabinets allowed young trees to be grown and tilted in an isotropic light environment in such a way that photosynthesis and growth are ensured by light, gravitropism is triggered by tilting the tree, but no phototropic signal is triggered because the lighting is the same from any direction around the tree (isotropy). This device thus made it possible to study the gravitropic response alone during long-term experiments under light conditions.</p><p>Two spherical growth cabinets with isotropic light were constructed: each device makes it possible to tilt a young tree in an isotropic light environment.

A fourth light power of 15W was obtained by setting a neutral filter (216 LEE FILTERS White Diffusion 15FT) in front of 22W neon tubes. The light source came from the lower side of the trees in order to better qualify the tree movements either upward towards the vertical (gravitropism) or downward towards the light source (phototropism). Depending on the size of the plant studied, the three neon tubes could be turned on independently to ensure that the light came only from the lower side of the tilted tree. In our experiments, two neon tubes were switched on for beech and oak. For poplar, since they greatly elongated during their tropistic movements until equilibrium, two, and then very rapidly (two weeks after the beginning of the experiment) three neon tubes were switched on, so that the entire plant remained laterally lit throughout the experiment.</p><p>To obtain an exact measurement of light fluence rates reaching the plant stem on the anisotropic light devices, measurements were performed with a ceptometer (AccuPAR LP-80, Decagon Devices) set parallel to the board where light sources were fixed. Measurements were made when the board containing the light sources was tilted at different angles: 0&#x000b0;, 5&#x000b0;, 15&#x000b0;, 25&#x000b0; and 35&#x000b0; from the vertical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209973.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The ceptometer made it possible to measure the photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR). Additional measurements with a spectrophotometer (FieldSpec Pro, Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) allowed us to obtain the spectrum of each type of neon tube (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209973.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), in particular, blue radiation, the main active one for phototropism. A very similar level of PAR and blue radiation was exhibited by 40W and 50W neon tubes. Spectra values of fluence rates in the PAR and in the blue radiation were computed by integration for every tilting angle and type of neon tube. On the basis of these computations of PAR and blue fluence rates, fluence rates of blue radiation included in the PAR measured by the ceptometer were computed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209973.s006">S1 Table</xref>).

The walls of the growth chambers were covered with black curtains to avoid reflection of light on the walls. Four anisotropic light devices could be installed in a growth chamber at the same time and two similar growth chambers were available at the same time, making it possible to experiment on eight plants simultaneously.</p><p>We monitored growth and tropistic movements. Stem diameters were measured weekly using a caliper. Secondary growth was expressed as the average daily diameter growth rate measured at 10 cm from the stem base. Tropistic movements were recorded every 2&#x02013;3 days by photographs until equilibrium was reached (no detectable movement for two weeks). In each treatment, a picture of the main stem was taken with a digital camera (CASIO, Exilim EX-F1). In order to obtain the scale within each picture, a gradual test card was fixed on each tilting device in the plane of the plant and set at the vertical. For each picture, particular care was taken to align the vertical bars of the grid of the camera screen with the vertical position using the gradual test card. The shape of the main stem on each picture was recorded by digitizing with ImageJ software (NIH) in order to obtain the coordinates (x,y) of each point along the stem. Sets of digitized points give the shape of each seedling stem. Two successive digitized points were approximately 0.5 cm apart.</p><p>A preliminary work was performed to assess experiment length: one young tree was tilted 35&#x000b0; on the isotropic light device and a very similar one was tilted on the anisotropic light device. Stem movements were then recorded until a steady-state shape was reached (no movement detected for two weeks).</p><p>In poplar seedlings, the fast growing species, the time of the experiment necessary to reach the steady state was approximately four weeks.

Because this study focused on methodological feasibility assessment and the experiments were long, all 16 treatments were conducted in only one replicate. Nevertheless, the four tilting angles under the 40W neon lighting were replicated for poplar and oak, but not for beech due to experimental hazards.

First, the values of M determined from final shapes are always higher than the values of M determined from kinematics data. To find some possible explanations for this discrepancy, we examined the relationship by clustering the data by light fluence rates in the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209973.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Doing so, the correlation coefficients were much higher than the ones obtained using the whole dataset with no clustering. As a general trend, the data obtained for a given lighting for small tilting treatments were the closest to the line 1:1. This result stems from the fact that when designing the <italic>ArC</italic> model, the sine law for both the angular response vs. gravity and vs. the light sources has been simplified to the first (linear) term of the sine Taylor series (see, for example, Equations. 4 and 11 in [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). This simplification is obviously only accurate for small angles. It is therefore almost not biased concerning the shape prediction by the model in the steady-state form (in general, the angles are moderate) or at the end of the tropistic kinematics, but the bias is greater at the beginning of the kinematics when the angles vs. gravity and/or the light source are high.</p><p>As a conclusion for these results on poplar, the determination of B by the <italic>AC</italic> model parameter method or by the final shape method provided good results, indicating that the <italic>AC</italic> model is validated when considering data concerning the pure gravitropic response of the trees. The determination of B by the <italic>ArC</italic> model parameters led to an underestimation of B, very probably due to our tilting device in anisotropic light (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec027">Discussion</xref> section).</p><p>The determination of M by the <italic>ArC</italic> model parameters obtained by the model parameter method and by the final shape method led to a four-fold discrepancy. This discrepancy can be easily attributed to problems of correlation of explicative variables due to our tilting device in anisotropic light, on the one hand, and to the possible lack of accuracy on the measurement of Ar on final stem shape, on the other. We thus concluded that the <italic>ArC</italic> model, already validated with data on herbaceous plants, could not be invalidated by our data on woody plants. We thus performed a model-assisted phenotyping of stem shape at equilibrium for oak and beech to determine their ratio of gravitropism/proprioception and gravitropism/phototropism sensitivities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Model-assisted phenotyping of stem shapes at GSA or PGSA steady state: For poplar, oak and beech</title><p>The average values of B and M determined from final shapes are given for each of the three species tested in <xref rid="pone.0209973.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, and the Ar and Ap values for M computations are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209973.s010">S5 Table</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0209973.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0209973.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of mean values and standard deviation of values of B and M parameters computed from stem shapes at gravitropic and photogravitropic equilibrium, respectively, for three species:</bold> Oak, beech and poplar.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0209973.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0209973.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">M</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Oak</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.89 (&#x000b1; 0.37)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.27 (&#x000b1; 3.30)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Beech</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.726 (&#x000b1; 0.29)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.69 (&#x000b1; 0.77)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Poplar</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.23 (&#x000b1; 0.035)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.51 (&#x000b1; 8.29)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t003fn001"><p>For M values, means were computed including data at different light fluence rates.

In particular, thanks to the isotropic light device, the gravitropic response alone under light conditions could be analyzed.</p><p>The three species displayed clear gravi- and phototropistic movements. Poplar displayed a classical tropistic movement consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, oak and beech displayed more complex behavior. In oak, the phototropic movement seems to be linked to the rhythmicity of growth, i.e., alternating phases of activity and phases of apparent inactivity of the terminal bud.</p><p>Concerning beech, in this study we focused on cases where tropistic movement could be observed. Nevertheless, the cases where no movement could be detected are also interesting. They suggest the existence of a gravitropic threshold in terms of inclination perception for gravitropism, which has, to our knowledge, never been demonstrated so far. Recent works on statoliths and gravisensing [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that &#x0201c;packed grains resting at the bottom of a container full of liquid will not move when the container is inclined unless the inclination becomes higher than a critical angle, typically around 25&#x000b0; for spherical grains&#x0201d;. In herbaceous plants, statoliths have been found not to behave like passive grains: they are subjected to constant active agitation that helps the grains to rearrange when a plant is titled, even at small angles, and to trigger a gravitropic response of the plant [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the case of beech, it might be hypothesized that through evolution, this tree species has lost its function of statolith agitation. This could explain why young beech trees tilted less than 20&#x000b0; do not exhibit any gravitropic response. This hypothesis should now be assessed through microscopic experiments on beech statoliths.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Validity of the models and accuracy of B and M values</title><p>All regressions processed on kinetics data were highly significant, so that the two models (<italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic>) explained a significant part of the processes. The determination coefficient was approximately 0.35 on average, which can appear to be not very high. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that the curvature is obtained by double spatial derivation of the shape so that the curvature variable is very sensitive to small local variations of the stem shape and to any digitizing noise. In addition, following this double spatial derivation, the curvature rate is obtained by temporal derivation of the curvature values, which also amplify the effect of small variations. It was thus expected that the variables would be noisy.</p><p>Overall, the two models seemed to provide interesting insights and could be used to phenotype the plants through the Balance number B and the Motion-pointing number M. As a general trend, it can be observed that B values computed from the <italic>AC</italic> model (using data obtained in isotropic light experiments) by the &#x0201c;model parameter method&#x0201d; or by the &#x0201c;final shape method&#x0201d; are close (around 2).</p><p>The discrepancy with the B values obtained by the fitting of the <italic>ArC</italic> models on the kinetics confirmed the recommendation of Bastien et al.: B values should be determined preferentially with data from experimental data of the sole gravitropic movement. This adds to the usefulness of the isotropic light device for any plant that, contrary to coleoptiles, requires light for growth.</p><p>The values of M computed by the <italic>ArC</italic> model parameter method are larger than those obtained by the final shape method. We attributed these differences to the correlation of predictive variables due to the design of the bending system in an anisotropic light environment, as explained earlier in the Results section.</p><p>It should be noted that the computation of M from Ar and from Ap is far more rapid than from values of sensitivity parameters obtained by linear regression of kinetics data of the tropistic movements. Nevertheless, it should also be observed that the determination of M on final stem shape is fast but quite error-sensitive because a small variation of Ar measurement leads to a rather large vibration of the M value: an error of 2&#x000b0; on Ar measurement leads to an error on the M value of about 15&#x02013;20%.</p><p>Further insight can be gathered here by comparing the 55W and 40W treatment. As explained in the M&#x00026;M section, they lead to very similar PAR and blue radiation. Moreover, it is better to focus only on the response to small angles of 15&#x000b0; and 5&#x000b0; (small angles are considered to avoid problems with large angles, as explained earlier). The variability on M values (measured as the standard error (SE)) computed at angles of 15&#x000b0; and 5&#x000b0; was 6.8 and 5.2 for poplar and 0.24 and 0.21 for oak, respectively. These values indicate that individual variability is smaller than variability due to the combined effects of individuals and light effects (SE = 8.29 for poplar and SE = 3.3 for oak; see <xref rid="pone.0209973.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, phenotyping M using measurements on shapes at photogravitropic equilibrium is a fast and reliable way to determine the ratio of gravitropic to phototropic sensitivities at small and moderate tilting angles.</p><p>Taken all together, it can therefore be concluded that the &#x0201c;final shape method&#x0201d; under isotropic and anisotropic light for the estimation of the value of the Balance number B and the Motion-pointing number M, respectively, is far more rapid and requires less data acquisition and analysis than the &#x0201c;model parameter method&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Independence of the photogravitropic equilibrium angle Ar from the tilting angle and dependence of Ar and M values on light intensity</title><p>Our results are in accordance with the results of Bastien et al., and contrary to the claim by Galland et al.

In our conditions, both isotropic light and anisotropic light devices provided enough PAR to ensure growth. The anisotropic light has the disadvantage of combining the anisotropic blue light-induced phototropic signal and anisotropic PAR. To circumvent this limit, a possibility could be to add LEDs that generate blue radiation within the isotropic light device. The isotropic device would then ensure photosynthesis and growth under isotropic PAR, and the additional LEDs would provide a good directional light source to trigger the phototropic reaction. This system would make it possible to manipulate the level of blue radiation for a given level of PAR and to efficiently control the direction of blue light and to thus disentangle tropistic and photosynthetic effects of blue light in the regulation of tropistic movements. Most importantly, it would also make it possible to better disentangle the effects of the tilting angle from that of the incipience angle of the blue light tropistic signal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The experimental setting combining an isotropic light device and an anisotropic light device used in this study is an original and powerful means to disentangle the gravitropic and phototropic responses of tree seedlings using experiments on Earth ground. The <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic> models have been partially experimentally validated for seedlings and young stems of woody species. Indeed, in these plants, the main stem is sufficiently slender for the motor aspects not to be a limiting factor of tropistic movements, and gravi- and photogravitropic equilibrium can be reached in a few weeks. Then, by combining isotropic and anisotropic light devices and model-assisted phenotyping of the tropistic drivers of the plants, we were able to develop a unique method to compute the Balance number B and the Motion-pointing number M (ratios of sensitivities of gravitropism/proprioception and gravitropism/phototropism, respectively), two intensive quantitative traits that summarized most of the control of the gravitropic and photogravitropic behavior.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of study on tropisms has been conducted on woody species. The phenotyping of the Balance and Motion-pointing numbers B and M on the stem shapes at gravi- or photogravitropic equilibrium (steady state) was found to be the most convenient approach since it requires less data, and both data measurement and analysis are rapid. This offers the possibility of phenotyping a larger number of stems, which is a requirement for comparing a large number of species or individuals.</p><p>Using this method, we were able to quantitatively discriminate three hardwood species contrasted by their mode of growth, habit and light requirements: poplar, oak and beech, through their B and M values (although more replicates are needed for a full assessment of these differences). It can also be suggested that the driving of tropism in the primary growth zone (motorized by differential primary elongation) and in the secondary growth zone (motorized by reaction wood formation) may be the same.</p><p>Our method was tested on very young stems. The extension of this work to larger trees (eventually to adult trees) is not straightforward. In addition to the obvious problem of size and duration of experiments, the equilibrium might not be reached in one growing season because of movement limitations due to the combination of the (large) bending resistance of the trunk and the (small) growth in girth [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is thus likely that the coupling of the <italic>AC</italic> and <italic>ArC</italic> driving models with process-based models of the tropistic motor [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] will be necessary. Nevertheless, it is likely that the control by the photo- and gravitropic sensitivities is genetically encoded and constant throughout the life of a tree, so that phenotyping of juvenile trees can also be relevant for their later stages [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Bastien et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported values of B between 2.5 and 3.5 for two-year-old poplars (<italic>deltoides*nigra</italic>). In this outdoor experiment [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the gravitropic stimuli was combined and collinear with the phototropic stimulus. It is then logical that the B values calculated using the <italic>AC</italic> model (without a proper account of phototropism) were higher than the ones found for pure gravitropism in this experiment (B = 2.3). However, the possible effect of phototropic stimulus in this experiment was minimized through a northwise leaning of the trees, and the use of a genotype considered by poplar practitioners as not very light-sensitive. Additionally, in the present study, poplar was found to be much more sensitive to gravitropism than to phototropism (M = 12), so that this overestimation should be small. In fact, the two values for poplar seedlings and two-year-old saplings are in the same range and very different from what was found for oak (B = 0.7), giving some experimental credit to the hypothesis that the values of B do not depend on the stage of the plant but primarily on its genotype.</p><p>Aside from a direct B-M phenotyping of adult trees, an alternative way could be to assess the relationship between the B-M values of very young individuals and the general habit of the mature tree. For example, since B (ratio of gravitropism and proprioception sensitivities) controls the degree of curving of an axis, it would be interesting to measure B on seedlings of a large number of genotypes (contrasted by their the more or less curved shape of their axes in adult trees), and to then check if B variability would explain the variability of axis shape (from straight to curved). Indeed, such juvenile*adult correlation on regulatory traits usually display increased genetic heritability and, consequently, are powerful tools for early selection [<xref rid="pone.0209973.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As another example, our results indicated that poplar may exhibit the highest gravitropism/phototropism ratio and oak the smallest. Moreover, mature poplar exhibits a more erect habit than oak. It may thus be hypothesized that the ratio of gravitropism/phototropism is a significant determinant of natural tree habit.</p><p>It is too early to draw statistically-substantiated definitive conclusions on these last topics from these first experiments. Nevertheless, our work provides illustrations of the insights that our approach can provide and raises hypotheses linking tropistic sensitivities and tree habit. These hypotheses should now be assessed on a large number of individuals, as well as on more species and genotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209973.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Spectra provided by 15W, 22W, 40W and 55W neon tubes.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209973.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209973.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Scheme presenting the computation of the angle of the stem from the vertical at the photogravitropic equilibrium (Ar) angle, angle of light direction from the vertical (Ap) and angle between the apex and the light direction (App).</title><p>A: For poplar and oak, Ar was measured at the tip of the stem.
