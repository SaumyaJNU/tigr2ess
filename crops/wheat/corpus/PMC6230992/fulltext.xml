Preliminary evidence indicates that monocots store high levels of free nucleotides and nucleosides but their potential as a source of internal organic nitrogen for use and remobilization is uncharted. Early tillering wheat plants were therefore starved of N over a 5-day time-course with examination of nucleic acid yields in whole shoots, young and old leaves and roots. Nucleic acids constituted &#x0223c;4% of the total N pool of N starved wheat plants, which was comparable with the N available from nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and greater than that available from the sum of 20 proteinogenic amino acids. Methods were optimized to detect nucleotide (purine and pyrimidine) metabolites, and wheat orthologs of RNA degradation (<italic>TaRNS</italic>), nucleoside transport (<italic>TaENT1, TaENT3</italic>) and salvage (<italic>TaADK</italic>) were identified. It was found that N starved wheat roots actively catabolised RNA and specific purines but accumulated pyrimidines. Reduced levels of RNA corresponded with induction of <italic>TaRNS2, TaENT1, TaENT3</italic>, and <italic>TaADK</italic> in the roots. Reduced levels of GMP, guanine, xanthine, allantoin, allantoate and glyoxylate in N starved roots correlated with accumulation of allantoate and glyoxylate in the oldest leaf, suggesting translocation of allantoin. Furthermore, N starved wheat plants exogenously supplied with N in the form of purine catabolites grew and photosynthesized as well as those plants re-supplied with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. These results support the hypothesis that the nitrogen and carbon recovered from purine metabolism can support wheat growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitrogen recycling</kwd><kwd>nitrate</kwd><kwd>purines</kwd><kwd>nucleosides</kwd><kwd><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic></kwd><kwd>equilibrative nucleoside transporter</kwd><kwd>ribonuclease</kwd><kwd>adenosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="20"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant growth and development is reliant on an adequate supply of micro- and macro-nutrients. Nucleotides (purine and pyrimidines), which are composed of the macro-nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C), are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The majority of cellular RNA can be found in complexes with proteins such as ribosomes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>), where they play an important role in protein synthesis. Ribosomal subunits are targets of degradation under nutrient limitation in a process first identified in yeast termed &#x02018;ribophagy&#x02019; (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>). This pathway is distinct from the ribosome quality control pathways responsible for eliminating defective ribosomes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Bassham, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bassham and MacIntosh, 2017</xref>). A ribophagy-like pathway was proposed to be conserved in plants involving the autophagy genes <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG9</italic> and a type II ribonuclease (RNS2) that resides in the vacuole and the ER (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">MacIntosh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Floyd et al., 2015</xref>). RNS2 defective mutants have longer lived rRNA, with most of the RNA accumulating in vacuoles, providing evidence of its function in the decay of rRNA (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hillwig et al., 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that this pathway is not only important in plants for nutrient recycling but also to maintain homeostasis under normal growth conditions as evidenced by induction of constitutive autophagy when this pathway is disrupted (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hillwig et al., 2011</xref>). Although <italic>RNS2</italic> is expressed at a high level in all tissues, expression is enhanced further under senescence and during inorganic phosphate starvation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Vacuolar RNA degradation by RNS2 produces 2&#x02032;nucleoside monophosphates (i.e., 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cAMP, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) which can be dephosphorylated by vacuolar phosphatases or phosphorylases. In Arabidopsis, these nucleosides can then be transported to the cytoplasm by the tonoplast localized equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Salvaged nucleosides can then undergo one of three fates; cell-to-cell or long-distance transport, nucleotide synthesis or catabolism (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;hlmann et al., 2010</xref>). All Arabidopsis ENT proteins identified (ENT1, 3, 4, 6, and 7) can transport the purine nucleosides adenosine and guanosine and the pyrimidine nucleosides cytidine and uridine (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000f6;hlmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wormit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Traub et al., 2007</xref>). AtENT3 was shown to be required for uptake of nucleosides by seedlings as an AtENT3 defective mutant was resistant to the toxic uridine analog fluorouridine (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Traub et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, both expression of <italic>ENT1</italic> and <italic>ENT3</italic> and nucleoside import was increased in Arabidopsis upon N stress (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cornelius et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Diagram of the purine pathway characterized in Arabidopsis adapted from <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al.

Cellular localization of these proteins is not known in wheat.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01539-g001"/></fig><p>Nucleotides synthesized from the salvage pathway come at a significantly reduced energetic cost than through <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zrenner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2009</xref>). Nucleosides and nucleobases remobilized from senescing tissue or excess from sources of reserve tissue (i.e., seeds) serve as precursors for the salvage pathway. It has been proposed that the salvage pathway predominately operates in early stages of germination, flowering, pollen tube growth and seed set (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zrenner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Girke et al., 2014</xref>). Nucleotides are salvaged from nucleoside monophosphates by the activity of phosphoribosyl transferases or nucleoside kinases. Adenosine kinase (ADK), for example, catalyzes the synthesis of adenine monophosphate from adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Moffatt et al., 2002</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The third fate for nucleosides is catabolism where nucleosidases (NSH) remove the ribose sugar from nucleosides to form nucleobases (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Zrenner et al., 2006</xref>), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Indeed, the activity of an Arabidopsis nucleoside hydrolase (AtNSH1) was shown to be essential to maintain a balance of the nitrogen pools within nucleotides and amino acids (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nucleosides and nucleobases can be catabolised via the purine and pyrimidine catabolic pathways liberating four and one molecule of ammonia, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) presumably for assimilation by the glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) cycle thereby recycling salvaged nitrogen (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Girke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that monocots store high levels of free nucleotides and nucleosides (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sawert et al., 1988</xref>). The total nucleotide content of wheat flag leaves was reported to be 2,660 nmol per gram dry weight compared to 400 nmol per gram dry weight in young tobacco leaves (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wagner and Backer, 1992</xref>). This is likely to be an underestimate of the actual nucleotide pool given the use of acid hydrolysis steps and less sensitive instruments for metabolite detection. Bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is hexaploid with a predicted genome size of 16 Gb (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Appels et al., 2018</xref>). Since there are two and five nitrogen elements per pyrimidine and purine nucleotide respectively, each copy of this large genome and the RNA species required for transcription, stores significant amounts of N. It is therefore probable that that under conditions of N stress, wheat can utilize nucleic acids and derivatives as an N (and P) source. This could be for immediate catabolism, allowing release of ammonia for reassimilation, or in the salvage pathway to replenish nucleotide pools that support numerous critical metabolic processes.</p><p>In this study, the potential role of nucleic acids as a source of N was examined in two bread wheat genotypes differing in nitrogen use efficiency (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mahjourimajd et al., 2016</xref>). Early tillering wheat plants were exposed to mild (24 h), mid (3 days) and severe (5 days) N starvation; the severity of the stress was demonstrated by changes in plant growth and plant N nutritional status. Catabolism of nucleic acids was compared with the induction of key genes involved in RNA degradation and nucleoside transport. A Liquid Chromatography triple quad Mass Spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS) method was optimized to quantify and authenticate purine and pyrimidine metabolites demonstrating a dynamic interaction of these metabolites and showing preferential degradation of purines in wheat under N stress. The role of this pathway in supporting plant growth was further explored by exogenous supply of purines to N starved wheat plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Growth</title><p>South Australian bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) lines differing in yields under varying N levels were selected for this experiment. The breeding line RAC875 (RAC655/3/Sr21/4<sup>&#x02217;</sup>LANCE//4<sup>&#x02217;</sup>BAYONET) is used in Australian breeding programs for its superior drought tolerance (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Izanloo et al., 2008</xref>). The high yielding commercial cultivar Mace (Wyalkatchem/Stylet) was shown to yield well across different Australian environments (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">National Variety Trial, 2014</xref>). Mace also consistently showed high NUE across four sites where there was a significant genotype by nitrogen interaction (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mahjourimajd et al., 2016</xref>). Preliminary evidence suggests greater nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of Mace (112.6 kg GY kg<sup>-1</sup> N) as compared to RAC875 (108.1 kg GY kg<sup>-1</sup> N) in a single site in South Australia, although both genotypes ranked amongst the top 8 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mahjourimajd et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Seeds were germinated on filter paper moistened with reverse osmosis water for 48 h at 22&#x000b0;C in the dark. Evenly sized imbibed seeds with 1 cm radicles were transferred to separate 120 L ebb and flow hydroponic systems which had a 13-min fill/drain cycle. Plants were grown on mesh collars within tubes (300 mm L &#x000d7; 50 mm W), which kept the roots of adjacent plants separate, but allowed free access to solution. The nutrient solution was a modified Johnson&#x02019;s solution (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1957</xref>) as detailed in <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Melino et al.

The hydroponic system was situated in a controlled environment room with a day: night cycle of 12 h: 12 h, 18&#x000b0;C: 15&#x000b0;C, at a flux density at canopy level of 640 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup>s-<sup>1</sup> (Experiment 2) and 300 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup>s-<sup>1</sup> (Experiments 1 and 3).

The response of each metabolite extracted from individual tissues (YFEL, Oldest leaf and Root) in Mace and RAC875 is presented with blue indicating significant down-regulation and red indicating significant up-regulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). As presented previously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), RNA yields were reduced in both the YFEL and the roots of Mace and RAC875 in response to the N starvation but levels were unchanged in the oldest leaf (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Ribonucleases cleave RNA releasing nucleotides (i.e., ATP and GTP) which can be hydrolysed to monophosphates (AMP or GMP) and free phosphate ions. Although ATP and AMP could not be detected in this method, GMP levels were reduced by 6- to 8-fold under N starvation but only in the roots suggesting either local use or reduced synthesis (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">5</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The nucleobase guanine can be cleaved from the ribose sugar; here guanine levels were reduced in the YFEL of Mace and unexpectedly in all tissues of RAC875 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The nucleoside adenosine and the nucleobase adenine were not significantly responsive to the treatment in either genotype or time point. However, there was some accumulation of the deaminated and hydrolysed form hypoxanthine in the oldest leaf of both genotypes. Mace roots also accumulated hypoxanthine, but a reduction was observed in the roots of RAC875 in response to N starvation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Guanine can also be deaminated to xanthine and similar to GMP responses, xanthine levels were reduced in the roots of both genotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The accumulation of xanthine, hypoxanthine and urate in the oldest leaf of N starved Mace plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) may indicate translocation of one of these or an up-stream metabolite from the roots. The purine catabolites down-stream of urate show a similar tissue-specific response with accumulation of allantoate, glyoxylate and succinate in the oldest leaf but a reduction in allantoin, glyoxylate and succinate in the roots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Amino acids relevant to glyoxylate metabolism were also assessed. All amino acids were down-regulated in response to N starvation with the exception of <sc>L</sc>-glutamate which accumulated in the oldest leaf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and was otherwise unchanged in the other tissues. <sc>L</sc>-glutamate is central to amino acid metabolism but also an important feedback regulator of ammonia assimilation, which has been noted as the reason for no diurnal or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> responsive changes to <sc>L</sc>-glutamate levels as reviewed by <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Stitt et al.

Under severe N stress, allantoin and specific downstream catabolites were reduced in the roots with accumulation of allantoate and glyoxylate in the leaves, which could suggest translocation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). To assess whether allantoin is degraded locally in the roots serving as an N source or whether it is exported to sink tissues, root allantoin catabolism was investigated in detail (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Root accumulation of allantoin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>) and catabolites allantoate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>) and glyoxylate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>) are presented along-side with transcriptional profiles of allantoinase (<italic>TaALN</italic>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref>) and allantoate amidohydrolase (<italic>TaAAH</italic>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). <italic>TaALN</italic> encodes a protein responsible for hydrolysis of allantoin to allantoate, and <italic>TaAAH</italic> encodes the enzyme to catabolise allantoate to ureidoglycine thereby releasing nitrogen in the form of ammonia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>). Root allantoin levels were reduced early in both genotypes; reductions of 19- to 28- fold were observed for Mace and RAC875 plants grown under mid N stress. This correlated with a 3.9- to 5- fold increase in expression of <italic>TaALN</italic> in those plants grown under mild N stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Despite a reduction in allantoin levels, the catabolite allantoate was unchanged in the roots of Mace and reduced in RAC875 roots only when grown under severe N stress. <italic>TaAAH</italic> was transcriptionally induced by 5-fold in Mace and 8-fold in RAC875 roots when plants were grown under severe N stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which in concurrence with the allantoate results suggests that allantoate is catabolised in the roots of plants grown under severe N stress. The loss of one molecule of allantoin should lead to one additional molecule of allantoate as indicated in the chemical structures shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), and since <italic>TaAAH</italic> was only induced under severe N stress, the lack of change in allantoate under mild and mid- N stress suggests that either allantoin or allantoate is translocated to the shoots. Although uredioglycolate and the other intermediate catabolic metabolites could not be detected using this method, glyoxylate, the carbon product after release of all amine groups, was detected. Glyoxylate was reduced in the roots of plants grown under mid and severe N stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), however, glyoxylate levels were enhanced in response to severe N stress in the above-ground leaves (YFEL and oldest leaf, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) further supporting a possible translocation from the roots.</p></sec><sec><title>Xanthine and Allantoin Can Serve as N Sources When Supplied Externally to N Starved Wheat Plants</title><p>Purines and pyrimidines are commonly found in root exudates (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dennis et al., 2010</xref>) and they can also be taken up by plants when supplied exogenously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Desimone et al., 2002</xref>).

Although characterization of this selective autophagy pathway is still in its infancy, there was evidence in the literature suggesting that wheat has a large pool of free nucleotides and nucleosides prompting this investigation into the nutritional benefits of nucleotide catabolism. Early tillering wheat plants starved of N for 5 days resulted in a 50% reduction of total N and an approximate 19% reduction in shoot NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The N starved plants were thereby experiencing severe N deficiencies leading to visible signs of chlorosis of the older leaves. A comparison of shifts in the shoot N pool demonstrated that across genotypes NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> dominated the N pool (15% of the total N pool as compared to nucleic acids which represented only 3.5&#x02013;4.4% of the total N pool) in plants grown under N sufficient conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, due to the greater depletion of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> after 5 days of N starvation, the N from nucleic acids (3.6&#x02013;4.8% of the total N pool) was more comparable with that from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (5.2&#x02013;6% of the total N pool), (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><sec><title>An N Efficient Wheat Genotype Responds to Mild N Stress</title><p>Genotypes contrasting in NUE were carefully selected for this study as little is known about how they store, utilize and respond to N limitations when they are establishing their tillers. Although the shoot fresh weight of RAC875 was greater than Mace, the total shoot nitrogen content was equivalent between Mace and RAC875 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>) suggesting that RAC875 is more responsive to N supply in this system. However, under N starvation conditions, both genotypes restricted growth and had comparable shoot N content; restricting growth is an important adaption to the environment ensuring that there is an adequate supply of N during flowering and grain filling. However, we cannot presume that the restriction at early vegetative stages observed here continues into the reproductive stages of development.</p><p>This system enabled us to dissect differences in the accumulation and distribution of nitrate, an important form of inorganic nitrogen. The uptake, translocation, storage and assimilation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is critical to later support the emerging flag leaf. For example, the YFEL of Mace accumulated 18% higher levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than RAC875 under N sufficient conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This perhaps indicates differences in storage of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>; the highest proportion of cellular NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is likely to be in the vacuole as was demonstrated in barley (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhen et al., 1991</xref>). However, on a whole shoot basis, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels were comparable between Mace and RAC875 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>). Although RNA yields in whole shoots were not significantly different between genotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), Mace roots responded to the N stress earlier than RAC875, leading to depletion of RNA under mild N starvation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Absolute DNA and RNA yields were reduced in RAC875 shoots under N starvation whilst only RNA levels were reduced in Mace shoots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, since thymidine was not detected in our quantitative metabolomics screen, it was impossible to differentiate between nucleotide degradation products derived from the catabolism of RNA from those derived from the catabolism of DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Catabolism Occurs in N Starved Wheat Roots</title><p>Since RNA yields were reduced in the shoots of both genotypes, we questioned whether RNA catabolism could differ between tissues to redistribute nutrient resources. N stress caused inhibition of the YFEL and oldest leaf but no changes to root growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>); we have similarly demonstrated root proliferation in wheat plants grown in N deficient soils (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Melino et al., 2015</xref>). Under N sufficient conditions, the YFEL accumulated more RNA than the roots or the oldest leaf as expected from a highly metabolically active tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). RNA yields were reduced in Mace roots from mild N starvation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Reduced RNA yields in the roots correlated with induction of <italic>TaRNS2, TaENT1</italic> and <italic>TaENT3</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Metabolic analysis further supported that nucleotide catabolism was up-regulated in N starved roots; with reduced levels of GMP, guanine, xanthine, allantoin, allantoate, glyoxylate and succinate under severe N stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Results from a comparison of root accumulation of three purine metabolites (allantoin, allantoate and glyoxylate) with the transcriptional response of genes encoding allantoin catabolism (<italic>TaALN, TaAAH</italic>) suggests that whilst allantoin may be catabolised through to glyoxylate in the roots of severe N starved plants, allantoin or allantoate is more likely to be translocated to above-ground tissue under mild N stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). This was supported by our results showing that allantoate accumulated in the oldest leaf whilst glyoxylate accumulated in both the YFEL and the oldest leaf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Young Wheat Leaves Shift From Local RNA Degradation to Importing Nucleosides</title><p>RNA yields were reduced in the YFEL of Mace plants grown under severe N stress. A lack of induction of <italic>TaRNS2</italic> suggests that vacuolar RNA catabolism did not occur in this tissue so that reduced RNA levels are likely due to reduced synthesis. The significant induction of <italic>TaENT3</italic> in the YFEL of N starved Mace plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) may indicate reliance on imported nucleosides rather than local degradation of RNA. There was like-wise no treatment effect on RNA yields in RAC875 plants supported by constitutive <italic>TaRNS2</italic> expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), however, reduced RNA yields over the 5 days of development was observed in the YFEL of RAC875 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), perhaps indicating reduced RNA synthesis in this tissue. One must also consider that these plants had two additional tillers with younger leaves which may demand reallocation of the available N.</p></sec><sec><title>Older Wheat Leaves Accumulate Nucleosides Despite an Apparent Reduction in RNA Synthesis</title><p>RNA abundance was more than 10-fold lower in the oldest leaf than that in the YFEL and there was no significant treatment effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Despite reduced RNA yields, the oldest leaf accumulated a large pool of free nucleosides and derivatives, which were enriched under N starvation (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">5</xref>). This was particularly evident for pyrimidines where under N starvation the oldest leaf accumulated 9-fold more pyrimidine nucleosides than the root and 1.7-fold more than the YFEL when averaged across both genotypes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">5</xref>). It is possible that RNA catabolism occurred developmentally earlier than was measured in this study and that the large pool of free nucleoside derivatives is the product of that process.</p><p>RNA catabolism was also not observed in the oldest leaf of N starved Mace and RAC875 plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and unexpectedly transcription of <italic>TaRNS2</italic> and <italic>TaENT1</italic> was enhanced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). It was previously shown that <italic>TaRNS2</italic> was induced in leaves at the transcriptional level under senescence and Pi starvation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 1993</xref>) and furthermore, RNS2 knock-down mutants were more sensitive to Pi starvation than the wild type controls (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bariola et al., 1999</xref>). We propose that transcription of <italic>RNS2, ENT1</italic> and <italic>ENT3</italic> is regulated by a signal of nutritional stress rather than by vacuolar accumulation of RNA or nucleosides.</p></sec><sec><title>N-Rich Purine Nucleosides Support Plant Growth</title><p>A comparison of root specific accumulation of purine and pyrimidine metabolites in N starved wheat plants showed a general trend of degradation of purine nucleoside catabolites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) but an accumulation of pyrimidine nucleosides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). This lends support to our hypothesis that the N-rich purine nucleosides, both free nucleosides derived from salvage pathways or from import and those derived from RNA catabolism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), can support the N requirements of growth. To evaluate this further, N starved wheat plants were exogenously supplied with xanthine or allantoin and their growth was monitored for 8 days. The results demonstrated that N starved wheat plants resupplied with these purine metabolites, could maintain photosynthetic rate and shoot dry weight comparably to the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). In fact, the resupply of xanthine or allantoin resulted in higher chlorophyll content. In contrast to our findings in wheat, 11 days old Arabidopsis seedlings were better able to utilize ammonium NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than allantoin or xanthine as the sole source of nitrogen (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Desimone et al., 2002</xref>). This may be due to the preferential and rapid uptake and assimilation of ammonium by Arabidopsis rather than NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Alternatively, it could be due to differences in purine uptake between plant species or different methodologies applied [steady-state supply by <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Desimone et al. (2002)</xref> as compared to N starvation and resupply here].</p><p>The N starved wheat plants resupplied with xanthine had a greater shoot %N than those either resupplied with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or grown under constant NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply without any period of N starvation. Since equivalent molecules of nitrogen were supplied in the form of xanthine and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, this must indicate that the xanthine derived N was assimilated. Another point to consider is that plants which were resupplied with xanthine and allantoin were provided with four molecules of carbon that were not present with the resupply of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and may have some impact on the recovery of these plants. None-the-less, this experiment demonstrated that purines can be taken up by roots and deaminated to release and recycle the nitrogen back into primary metabolism. Allantoin and xanthine can be taken up into roots and then translocated to the shoot by the activity of proteins in the ureide permease family; evidenced by the fact that UPS5 defective mutants hyperaccumulate allantoin in their roots and have reduced shoot allantoin levels (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Desimone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lescano et al., 2016</xref>). Translocation of <sup>15</sup>N labeled allantoin or allantoate would need to be experimentally verified in wheat, however, allantoin is known to be translocated in Arabidopsis and bean by the activity of ureide permease (UPS) transporters (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Desimone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;lissier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lescano et al., 2016</xref>), which are yet to be identified in wheat. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Curci et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated, using an RNA-seq approach, that a ureide permease (based on sequence identity to <italic>AtUPS5</italic> which transports allantoin, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>) was down-regulated in durum wheat leaf/stem at reproductive stages of development in response to N deficiency. However, a putative nucleobase symporter and a probable purine permease were up-regulated in the roots in response to N limitation. An examination of UPS activity in wheat is needed to better understand how purines from the root support reproductive above-ground growth.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the premise that wheat stores high levels of free nucleotides (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sawert et al., 1988</xref>), we investigated the contribution of nucleic acid catabolism to N recycling and the support of early vegetative growth and development. A comparison of shoot N pools revealed that nucleic acids could represent a vital source of N (&#x0223c;4% of the N pool) for plants grown under N stress when shoot nitrate levels are low. Supplying purine derivatives exogenously was shown to support the recovery of N starved wheat plants as efficiently as exogenous nitrate supply. Furthermore, RNA and purine catabolism were induced in rapidly growing roots of plants exposed to N starvation, as were transcriptional levels of genes encoding RNA degradation and nucleoside transport. On the other-hand, total pyrimidine nucleotides and derivatives accumulated 2- to 6-fold in N starved plants and are therefore unlikely contributors of N in the tissues examined. These results collectively support our hypothesis that N recovered from purine catabolism enters primary metabolism to maintain plant growth and cellular processes under N limiting conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SH and MO initiated the project idea.
