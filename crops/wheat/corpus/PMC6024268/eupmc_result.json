    "There has been broad interest to explore the presence of autoimmunity among wheat-sensitive individuals, but neither the pathogenesis nor the relevance has been established. In this study, we evaluated the frequencies and levels of autoantibodies, which are important biomarkers of autoimmunity, in subjects with wheat-related disorders and controls. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and the specific ones against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) were investigated.A total of 713 subjects who showed symptoms related to wheat ingestion were addressed to Vibrant America Clinical Laboratory from December 2015 to November 2017. Serum samples were collected from all subjects and tested with a wheat protein antibody panel (IgG and IgA to 18 proteins at the peptide level) and an autoantibody panel (ANA by immunofluorescence analysis and 10 ENA antibodies). Retrospective analysis was completed using de-identified clinical data and test results.In the retrospective analysis, 38 (5%) were seropositive in a Celiac Disease panel, 491 (83%) were seropositive in a wheat protein antibody panel \"Wheat Zoomer,\" and 84 (12%) were seronegative in both panels. Anti-nuclear antibodies were detected in similar portions of the celiac disease subjects (13%), the Wheat Zoomer-positive subjects (12%), and seronegative controls (15%), which is also very close to the reported occurrence of ANA positivity (15%) in the healthy population. The prevalence of anti-ENA was reported to be less than 2% in the general population; however, our study found it to be much higher in the celiac disease subjects (29%) and the wheat-sensitive subjects (27%), compared with a smaller proportion of seronegative controls (19%). The prevalence of anti-histone was especially prominent among the celiac disease subjects (73%) and the Wheat Zoomer-positive subjects (60%).High proportions of wheat-related disease subjects carry ENA antibodies that are important specific biomarkers of autoimmunity."
