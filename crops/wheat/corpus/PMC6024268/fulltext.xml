For some individuals, wheat ingestion is associated with a cascade of symptoms from gastrointestinal distress such as diarrhea, constipation, bloating, cramping, and altered bowel habits to extraintestinal symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, depression, and cognitive difficulties.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Among a broad spectrum of wheat-related disorders, celiac disease is the best known: a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy in which dietary gluten leads to small bowel inflammation and villous atrophy in genetically susceptible individuals. Celiac disease affects about 1% of adults and children in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Another emerging wheat-related disease is nonceliac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), which is a condition with both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms related to wheat or gluten intake that occurs in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy. Currently there is no well-characterized biomarker or diagnostic test for NCWS, although 1% to 6% of the population is estimated to be affected by NCWS.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Aside from gluten, some of the lesser known components of wheat may also play a role.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Over the past few years, celiac disease has been associated with more than a few autoimmune disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Remarkably, in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis, Graves&#x02019; disease),<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Addison&#x02019;s disease,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr11-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr15-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and autoimmune hepatitis,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> the frequency of celiac disease is much higher than that in the normal population. However, there is scarce information regarding systemic autoimmune disorders in celiac disease and other types of wheat-related disorders. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and the specific ones against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) have been recognized as diagnostic features of systemic autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], mixed connective tissue disorder). Carroccio et al reported in a retrospective study that the prevalence of ANA was 24% in the celiac patients and 46% in the NCWS patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The same group also researched a prospective cohort and found ANA&#x02019;s prevalence to be 7.5% in the celiac patients and 28% in the NCWS patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In another comparative study by Volta et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> ANA was observed in 49% of the patients with celiac disease, reflecting a predominant autoimmune profile, as compared with 37% in the NCWS patients.</p><p>In this study, we researched the frequency and level of ANA and 10 ENA antibodies in seropositive subjects in either celiac disease panel or wheat protein antibody panel and seronegative controls.

A significant number of studies including the present one indicate this to be related with sex, with a much higher frequency in women. Serum biomarkers such as anti-tTG and anti-dGP have been well validated for diagnosing celiac disease; however, the lack of diagnostic markers has remained as a major problem in identifying patients with less defined wheat-sensitive conditions. Even though the copresence of celiac disease with a few other systemic autoimmune diseases was broadly reported, the prevalence of autoantibodies in celiac disease and wheat sensitivity has been underinvestigated.</p><p>In our study, we first researched the prevalence of ANA, a hallmark for diagnosis of systemic autoimmunity, in subjects with celiac disease and in those who were Wheat Zoomer positive. ANA positivity was observed in 5 (13%) of the celiac disease subjects, 71 (12%) of the Wheat Zoomer&#x02013;positive subjects, and 13 (15%) of the non-wheat sensitivity subjects. Similar comparative studies have been conducted by several other groups and found the results different to some extent. In a study of 56 celiac patients, 118 first-degree relatives, and 101 healthy controls, ANA was detected in 9% of the celiac disease group, whereas ANA positivity was not seen in any of the healthy controls. However, Caglar et al<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> reported that there should be no significant difference in the ANA prevalence between these 2 groups, whereas they found it to be 12% (4/31) in the celiac patients and 13.8% (4/29) in the healthy controls. Although our result seems to be consistent with the numbers reported by Caglar et al, we would like to address that ANA positivity exists in 15% of the apparently healthy population, which is not significantly different from the numbers that we observed.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>According to our own study and some other studies, a subgroup (20%&#x02013;30%) of the autoimmune patients would have their anti-ENA detected 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;years earlier than ANA being detected.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In this study, the prevalence of anti-ENA was also observed to be much higher than that of ANA among the subjects. Anti-ENA positivity was observed in 11 (29%) of the celiac disease subjects, 159 (27%) of the Wheat Zoomer&#x02013;positive subjects, and 16 (19%) of the non-wheat sensitivity subjects. We hypothesize that the prevalence of ANA in this cohort would become more disparate after a longer period of time as a higher proportion of them already carried anti-ENA.</p><p>In our study, histone antibody was detected in 73% of the celiac disease subjects and 60% of the Wheat Zoomer&#x02013;positive subjects. Histone antibody is primarily associated with drug-induced lupus erythematosus, particularly used in distinguishing drug-induced lupus from other forms of lupus such as SLE, from another autoimmune disorder, or from another cause of a person&#x02019;s symptoms. In a study of association between celiac disease and bacterial transglutaminase in food processing by Lerner et al, core histone was found to be cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase and it could be crucial for chromatin condensation and chromosomal expression.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, there have been no previous studies of histone antibodies in patients with celiac disease or other wheat-related diseases. In all 3 groups evaluated in our study, very few patients (less than 5%) were positive for Jo-1, Sm, and RNP antibody. As far as we are aware, there have been no previous studies of these 3 antibodies in patients with celiac disease or other wheat-related diseases.</p><p>Within the cohort of wheat-sensitive subjects, we analyzed the distribution of wheat protein antibody among the ANA-positive and anti-ENA&#x02013;positive subjects. In both groups, gliadin antibodies were the highest (66% in ANA and 68% in ENA groups), followed by non-gluten proteins (61% in both groups). Although &#x003b1;/&#x003b3;-gliadin and its deamidated forms are the focus of most commercial tests, the Wheat Zoomer covers all known gliadins from all the different wheat species (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b3;-, and &#x003a9;-gliadins) in both native and deamidated forms. In our study, the high frequency of gliadin antibodies in autoantibody-positive subjects can be contributed to its high prevalence but also the utilization of a more sensitive and comprehensive testing tool. Moreover, nongluten proteins including serpin, farnins, amylase/protease inhibitors, globulins, purinin have been shown to be immune reactive in celiac disease patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1177271918782893" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In our case, we confirmed the prominent presence of nongluten proteins in other types of wheat-sensitive subjects as well.</p><p>In conclusion, our data present a strong tendency toward autoimmunity in patients with wheat-related disorders, characterized by the presence of anti-ENA biomarkers. Therefore, evaluation of autoimmune antibodies is appropriate when existence of an additional autoimmune disease is suspected in patients with wheat-related disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Vibrant America LLC for supporting this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Y.Y., P.D., are employees of Vibrant America LLC.
