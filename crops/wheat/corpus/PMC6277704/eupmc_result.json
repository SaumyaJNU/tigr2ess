    "Potassium (K) distribution is horizontally heterogeneous under the conservation agriculture approach of no-till with strip fertilization. The root foraging strategy of wheat for K heterogeneity is poorly understood. In this study, WinRHIZO, microarray, Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) and a split-root system were performed to investigate root morphology, gene expression profiling and fluxes of K+ and O2 under K heterogeneity and homogeneity conditions. The split-root system was performed as follows: C. LK (both compartments had low K), C. NK (both compartments had normal K), Sp. LK (one compartment had low K) and Sp. NK (the other compartment had normal K). The ratio of total root length and root tips in Sp. NK was significantly higher than that in C. NK, while no significant differences were found between Sp. LK and C. LK. Differential expression genes in C. LK vs. C. NK had opposite responses in Sp. LK vs. C. LK and similar responses in Sp. NK vs. C. NK. Low-K responsive genes, such as peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor activity, calcium ion binding, glutathione transferase and cellular respiration genes were found to be up-regulated in Sp. NK. However, methyltransferase activity, protein amino acid phosphorylation, potassium ion transport, and protein kinase activity genes were found to be down-regulated in Sp. LK. The up-regulated gene with function in respiration tended to increase K+ uptake through improving O2 influx on the root surface in Sp. NK, while the down-regulated genes with functions of K+ and O2 transport tended to reduce K+ uptake on the root surface in Sp. LK. To summarize, wheat roots tended to perform active-foraging strategies in Sp. NK and dormant-foraging strategies in Sp. LK through the following patterns: (1) root development in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK; (2) low-K responsive genes, such as peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor activity, calcium ion binding and respiration, were up-regulated in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK; and (3) root K+ and O2 influxes increased in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK. Our findings may better explain the optimal root foraging strategy for wheat grown with heterogeneous K distribution in the root zone."
