<italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T2</italic> (<italic>FT2</italic>) is expressed in the distal part of the developing wheat spike and contributes to the regulation of the number of spikelets per spike.</p></abstract><abstract><title>Abstract</title><p>
<italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T2</italic> (<italic>FT2</italic>) is the closest paralog of the <italic>FT1</italic> flowering gene in the temperate grasses. Here we show that overexpression of <italic>FT2</italic> in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and barley results in precocious flowering and reduced spikelet number, while down-regulation by RNA interference results in delayed flowering and a reduced percentage of filled florets. Similarly, truncation mutations of <italic>FT2</italic> homeologs in tetraploid wheat delayed flowering (2&#x02013;4 d) and reduced fertility. The wheat <italic>ft2</italic> mutants also showed a significant increase in the number of spikelets per spike, with a longer spike development period potentially contributing to the delayed heading time. In the wheat leaves, <italic>FT2</italic> was expressed later than <italic>FT1</italic>, suggesting a relatively smaller role for <italic>FT2</italic> in the initiation of the reproductive phase. <italic>FT2</italic> transcripts were detected in the shoot apical meristem and increased during early spike development. Transversal sections of the developing spike showed the highest <italic>FT2</italic> transcript levels in the distal part, where new spikelets are formed. Our results suggest that, in wheat, <italic>FT2</italic> plays an important role in spike development and fertility and a limited role in the timing of the transition between the vegetative and reproductive shoot apical meristem.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Barley</kwd><kwd><italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic></kwd><kwd>cereals</kwd><kwd>flowering</kwd><kwd>FLOWERING LOCUS</kwd><kwd><italic>T1 (FT1</italic>)</kwd><kwd><italic>FT2</italic></kwd><kwd>spike development</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The time of year at which a plant flowers has an enormous influence on its reproductive success. For cereal crops, flowering outside the optimum time can significantly compromise grain yield and quality. The main seasonal signals used by temperate cereals to adjust flowering to an optimal reproductive time are the length of the night (photoperiod) and the exposure to extended periods of low temperatures (vernalization) (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Distelfeld <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Wheat is a long day plant, and flowers earlier when the duration of the night is short or is interrupted by a short pulse of light (night break, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Pearce <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The pathways perceiving different environmental signals converge on the regulation of <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Turck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). FT has been identified as a widely conserved regulator of floral induction, termed florigen, which is produced in the leaves and is transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Corbesier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Jaeger and Wigge, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Tamaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). At its destination, FT forms a flowering activation complex by interacting with 14-3-3 proteins and the bZIP transcription factor FD (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Pnueli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wigge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Taoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The 14-3-3 proteins are expressed in most tissues, where they act as a scaffold that links FT and FD. The more restricted expression of <italic>FD</italic> provides temporal and spatial specificity (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This complex then interacts with promoters of a number of MADS box genes including <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic> in wheat), <italic>FRUITFULL</italic> (<italic>FUL</italic>) and <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>), to initiate flowering (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Michaels <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wigge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Corbesier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Mathieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>FT belongs to a family of small proteins characterized by a specific phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) binding protein (PEBP) domain. <italic>In vitro</italic>, FT binds to the diurnally changing phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) which affects its ability to regulate flowering (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The PEBP gene family includes both activators and repressors of flowering (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Pin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which have been grouped into three main subfamilies: <italic>TERMINAL FLOWER1</italic> (<italic>TFL1</italic>)-like, <italic>MOTHER OF FT</italic> (<italic>MFT</italic>)-like and <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>)-like (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Higgins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), which are conserved in cereals (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Chardon and Damerval, 2005</xref>). <italic>FT</italic> belongs to the <italic>FT</italic>-like family, which includes at least six <italic>FT</italic>-like genes (<italic>FT1</italic> to <italic>FT6</italic>) in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Faure <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Halliwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>High transcript levels of <italic>FT1</italic> in temperate cereals are associated with accelerated flowering, suggesting a role in the promotion of flowering similar to Arabidopsis <italic>FT</italic> and rice <italic>Hd3a</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Nitcher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Ream <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Down-regulation of <italic>FT1</italic> by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in non-flowering plants in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and a 2&#x02013;4 weeks flowering delay in hexaploid wheat mutants (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). A similar delay of 25 d was observed in tetraploid wheat mutant plants combining a truncation mutation in <italic>ft-A1</italic> with an amino acid substitution in the <italic>ft-B1</italic> PEBP motif (P77S) (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). This double mutant will be designated hereafter as <italic>ft1</italic>-mut rather than <italic>ft1</italic>-null because we currently do not know if it is a complete loss-of-function mutation. If <italic>FT1</italic> is not essential for wheat flowering, other <italic>FT</italic>-like genes may be involved in the induction of flowering in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Shaw <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In wheat, <italic>FT2</italic> is the gene most similar to <italic>FT1</italic> (78% protein identity) suggesting a relatively recent duplication. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this duplication occurred after the divergence between the grasses and Arabidopsis lineages, and that the <italic>FT1&#x02013;FT2</italic> duplication in the grasses is independent of the <italic>FT&#x02013;TWIN SISTER of FT</italic> (<italic>TSF</italic>) duplication in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Faure <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dubcovsky, 2008</xref>). Therefore, the study of the sub-functionalization of these genes requires independent experiments in the two lineages.</p><p>The <italic>FT1</italic> and <italic>FT2</italic> genes have received different names in different grass species. The closest homologs of wheat <italic>FT1</italic> and <italic>FT2</italic> in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> were originally designated as <italic>FTL2</italic> (Bradi1g48830) and <italic>FTL1</italic> (Bradi2g07070), respectively (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Higgins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, <italic>FTL1</italic> was later re-designated as <italic>BdFT2</italic> and <italic>FTL2</italic> as <italic>BdFT1</italic> to match the phylogenetic relationships among the temperate grasses (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In this study, we will follow the later nomenclature. In rice, the closest homologs of wheat <italic>FT1</italic> are <italic>Hd3</italic> (<italic>OsFTL2</italic>) and <italic>RFT1</italic> (<italic>OsFTL3</italic>) and the closest to wheat <italic>FT2</italic> is <italic>OsFTL1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Izawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In a QTL study in barley, polymorphisms in the <italic>FT2</italic> 3&#x02032;-untranslated region were associated with small differences in heading time (1.2 d) (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, this gene was detected in the SAM and its expression profile correlated with the up-regulation of <italic>FT1</italic> in the leaves and with multiple genes involved in inflorescence and floral organ development in the SAM (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Digel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>BdFT2</italic> in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) or <italic>OsFTL1</italic> in rice (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Izawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) induced rapid flowering in transgenic calluses. In addition, overexpression of <italic>OsFTL1</italic> in rice resulted in reduced panicles or a single terminal flower (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Izawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In this paper, we show that in the temperate cereals <italic>FT2</italic> plays an important role in spike development and fertility and a more limited role in the regulation of the initial transition of the SAM to the reproductive phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and phenotyping</title><p>The materials used in this study included the diploid <italic>B. distachyon</italic> Bd21-3, the barley variety Golden Promise (<italic>Hordeum vulgare L.</italic>), and the tetraploid wheat variety Kronos (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>durum</italic>). Bd21-3 has a weak vernalization requirement (2&#x02013;3 weeks) and is photoperiod sensitive (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Ream <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Golden Promise carries spring alleles at both the <italic>Vrn-H1</italic> and <italic>vrn-H2</italic> loci and the photoperiod-insensitive allele <italic>ppd-H1</italic>. Kronos carries the <italic>Vrn-A1</italic> allele for spring growth habit, a functional <italic>vrn-B2</italic> allele for winter growth habit, and the <italic>Ppd-A1a</italic> allele that confers earlier flowering under short days resulting in a reduced photoperiod response.</p><p>
<italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and barley plants were grown in a greenhouse at 25 &#x000b0;C and a long day (LD) photoperiod (16 h light&#x02013;8 h dark) with a light intensity of 203 &#x000b5;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> seeds were vernalized at 4&#x000b0; C without light for 32 d. Wheat seeds were stratified at 4 &#x000b0;C for 2 d in the dark before germination.

For the 2015 field trial, a minimum of 25 plants per line were sown on 7 January 2015 and heading time was recorded for each individual plant as the number of days from planting to full emergence of the main spike. For the 2017 field trial, seeds were sown on 18 November 2016 in a randomized block design (eight blocks) and heading time was recorded when 50% of the plants showed fully emerged spikes. For the 2017 trial, spike traits were measured from four plants per row for a total of eight rows per genotype (except for the wild-type, from which we measured four rows due to poor germination in the other four rows). Average spike length (SPL) was measured from the base of the spike to the tip of the terminal spikelet, excluding awns. The number of spikelets per spike (SPS) was determined by adding the number of fertile and non-fertile spikelets. The number of florets per spikelet (FLS) was determined from the two middle spikelets of the spike. Spikes were threshed, grain number was counted, and the average grain weight was calculated by dividing the total grain weight by the number of grains per spike (GRS). Seed setting rate (fertility) was calculated as the number of grain per spike divided by the number of florets per spike.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Plasmid construction and transformation</title><p>Constructs and protocols to overexpress or down-regulate <italic>FT2</italic> are described in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online.

Finally, this study identified positive and negative effects of the <italic>FT2</italic> mutations on different yield components and proposed strategies to separate those effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s20"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
