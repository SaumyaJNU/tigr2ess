Obesity is associated with several health consequences including increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Obesity and T2D increase the risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], where Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease is the most common type of dementia in diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Measures for primary prevention based on diet are thus urgently needed. Intake of dietary fiber (DF), in particular in the form of whole grain (WG), have been shown to reduce risk of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], T2D and CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, specific diets, e.g. diets rich in nuts, berries, fish, beans, olive oil and WG are associated with slower rate of cognitive decline in both observational [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and in intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prospective studies further revealed that DF from cereals (primarily from WG breads and rolled oats) were positively correlated with &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; ageing including aspects such as good cognitive function and absence of depressive syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Intervention studies evaluating the effects of WG foods on cognitive functions in healthy individuals are limited. However, short-term intervention studies with WG foods, such as WG barley or rye products rich in intact kernels, and hence rich in DF in the form of both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starch (RS), have shown anti-diabetic and anti-obesogenic potential in healthy middle-aged subjects and/or in healthy young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, intake of WG rye bread composed of 1:1 ratio of kernels and flour, containing also RS type 2 (RS2) from high-amylose maize (HAMRS2), resulted in decreased glucose and insulin responses in young adults the following morning after a standardized breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. HAMRS2 was added to the bread recipe to compensate for the loss of RS (and hence also total DF) when milling the kernels to flour, and to further increase the RS above the content in intact kernels. The results support anti-diabetic potential of WG rye, and may indicate an importance of RS in the cereals to achieve metabolic benefits. The WG rye with added HAMRS2 also increased the satiety inducing gut hormone PYY and decreased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, compared to white wheat based bread (WWB). The observed benefits on glucose regulation and appetite variables were proposed to originate from colonic fermentation of the specific DF present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], possible through mechanisms involving production of fermentation metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid). It has been proposed that SCFA may stimulate the release of gut hormones such as GLP&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1 and PYY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; hormones which are important for appetite- and metabolic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Brain-derived neurothophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin suggested to be a potential biomarker for neuronal integrity, and is mainly located in areas of the brain that are associated with cognitive control, e.g. memory formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. BDNF affects e.g. appetite suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Reduced levels of BDNF have been detected in patients suffering from e.g. Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. BDNF is also widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Previously, increased plasma BDNF concentrations were observed in young healthy adults after intervention with WG rye kernel-based bread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In animals (rats), prebiotic feeding (fructo-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides) was shown to increase the expression of BDNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The effect was suggested to be mediated through a prebiotic induced increase in gut hormones, indicating involvement of colonic fermentation in regulation of BDNF. Furthermore, in mouse models administration of sodium butyrate was shown to upregulate BDNF levels in the frontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Diets or foods that induce improvements of caradiometabolic risk factors may be beneficial also with regard to cognitive functions and mood. E.g., in healthy middle aged subjects it was shown that daily supplementation with n-3 PUFA for 5&#x000a0;weeks resulted in decreased plasma triacylglycerides and lowered systolic blood pressure, in parallel with improved performance in a working memory (WM) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, 5&#x000a0;weeks daily intake of a mixed berry beverage high in polyphenols, improved performed in a WM test compared to a carbohydrate matched control beverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Concomitantly the berry beverage reduced total- and LDL cholesterol, and lowered postprandial insulin concentrations. Further, in healthy subjects a bread product with the capacity to induce a metabolically favorable postprandial blood glucose profile resulted in an improved performance in a selective attention (SA) test, in comparison with intake of a high glycaemic index bread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, glucose tolerance was positively related to performance in the cognitive tests. Consequently, there seems to be a relation between cardiometabolic risk markers and cognitive functions not only in T2D subjects but also in healthy individuals. In addition it has been suggested that gut hormones may be involved in regulating cognition and mood. Thus, it has been shown that PYY may have anti-depressant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and that GLP&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1 may contribute to improve cognitive functions such as memory and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">As described above, WG rye products have the potential to improve measures of metabolic regulation in healthy subjects, and increase gut hormones such as PYY and GLP&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the effects on cognitive functions and mood of short-term intervention with WG rye in healthy middle-aged subjects have not previously been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of short-term intervention with WG rye bread containing a mixture of kernels and flour (1:1 ratio) supplemented with HAMRS2 (Hi-Maize&#x000ae;), on measures of cognitive functions (WM and SA) and mood in a cohort of healthy middle-aged subjects. In addition cardiometabolic risk markers, BDNF, gut hormones and subjective appetite were measured. Gut microbiota fermentation metabolites (SCFA and breath hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)) were determined to assess the involvement of gut fermentation. In this crossover study, WG rye bread and white wheat bread (WWB, reference) was consumed during 3 consecutive days in separate periods, before determination of test variables after a standardized breakfast at day 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="Par47">Registration of the study was made at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03275948).

The test subjects arrived to the research unit (Food for Health Science Centre, Lund University) at 0745&#x000a0;am. After resting for 10&#x000a0;min in a sitting position the fasting blood samples were collected via venous and capillary sampling. In addition, subjective appetite ratings, subjective mood ratings and breath H<sub>2</sub> excretion were measured in the fasting state. Once the fasting samples had been collected, the standardized breakfast was served (WWB and 200&#x000a0;ml water). The subjects were instructed to consume the breakfast within 10 to 12&#x000a0;min. Collection of physiological test markers and cognitive tests were performed repeatedly during 3&#x000a0;h. The cognitive tests started 30&#x000a0;min after commencing the standardized breakfast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Physiological test parameters</title><p id="Par56">Fasting and postprandial measurements of physiological test variables were determined at both visits. Capillary blood via finger-prick was collected for determination of blood glucose (HemoCue&#x000ae;B-glucose, HemoCue AB, &#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden) and serum (s-) insulin. Blood glucose and insulin were determined at fasting and every 15&#x000a0;min during the first hour, and thereafter every half hour until 180&#x000a0;min after commencing the standardized breakfast. Venous blood samples were collected at fasting to determine FFA and triglycerides in serum, and BDNF, CRP, GLP-1, PYY, GLP-2, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-18, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and SCFA in plasma. Blood collecting tubes used for analysis of GLP-1, PYY and GLP-2 contained an inhibition cocktail consisting of DPPIV-inhibitor (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/ml blood) (Millipore, St Charles, USA) and aprotinin (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/ml blood) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA). Breath H<sub>2</sub> excretion was measured at fasting using an EC 60 gastrolyzer (Bedfont EC60 Gastrolyzer, Rochester, England) as a course indicator of gut fermentation activity. Subjective appetite sensations (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) were measured at fasting and every half hour until 180&#x000a0;min. Registration of subjective mood ratings (valence and activity) were made at fasting and every hour until 180&#x000a0;min. Subjective appetite and mood ratings were registered using sheets of 100&#x000a0;mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The ratings were assessed using separate scales for each test variable and each test point. The test was composed of black scales (100 mm lines) on a white A4 paper. Each line (scale) was marked in the middle (at 50&#x000a0;mm) to facilitate a correct response. The subjects were instructed that the mark in the middle indicate an answer corresponding to not agree in any direction regarding the subjective rating of the test variable. They were instructed that the more deviation the judgement was marked on the scale from the middle mark, the stronger judgement of the test variable. One end of the scale (0&#x000a0;mm) corresponding to &#x0201c;no agreement at all&#x0201d; regarding the subjective test variable, and the other end of the scale (100&#x000a0;mm) correspond to a total (100%) agreement with the subjective test variable. Determination of serum insulin concentrations was performed using a solid phase two-site enzyme immunoassay kit (Insulin ELISA 10&#x02013;1113-01, Mercordia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and s-FFA concentrations were determined using an enzymatic colorimetric method using a 96 well microplate (NEFA C, ACS-ACOD method, WAKO Chemicals GMbH, Germany). Serum triglycerides concentrations were analyzed with a multi-sample enzymatic assay (LabAssay&#x02122; Triglyceride 290&#x02013;63,701, GPODAOS method, Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany). The quantitative determination of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in plasma were performed with enzyme immunoassays (Human IL-1&#x003b2;/IL-1F2 HSLB00D and Human IL-6 HS600B, respectively, R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) and p-IL-18 with an enzyme immunoassay that was modified to eliminate that no dilution of plasma was performed prior to the analysis (Human IL-18 ELISA Kit 7620, MBL Medical &#x00026; Biological Laboratories CO., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). Enzyme immunoassay was also used to determine BDNF in plasma (ChemiKine BDNF Sandwich ELISA kit CYT306, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents, USA and Canada), p-CRP (CRP ELISA Kit, Immunodiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany) and p-LBP (Human LBP ELISA Kit EKH3120, Nordic Biosite, T&#x000e4;by Sweden). Plasma GLP-2 and p-PYY (PYY (3&#x02013;36) and PYY (1&#x02013;36)) concentrations were determined with a competitive enzyme immunoassay (Human GLP-2 EIA YK141 and Human PYY EIA YK080, respectively, Yanaihara Institute Inc. Shizuoka, Japan). The quantitative determination of p-GLP-1 concentrations were performed using a highly sensitive ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (GLP-1 (Active 7&#x02013;36) ELISA 43-GP1HU-EO1 ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA).

One of the main findings concerns the increased ratings of mood parameters, both valance and activation, in the morning after the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention compared to after the WWB intervention. Furthermore, the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention increased insulin sensitivity, decreased fasting concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2; and induced higher fasting plasma concentrations of gut hormones PYY and GLP-2, compared to the WWB intervention. Additionally, the fasting concentrations of acetate and butyrate, and the breath H<sub>2</sub> excretion were significantly increased when preceded by the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention, indicating increased gut fermentation activities. Other important findings were the significant inverse relationships between parameters of glucose regulation with both mood parameters and performance in cognitive tests. Hence, the postprandial insulin response was negatively correlated with both feelings of happiness and performance in the WM-tests after intake of RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 and WWB, respectively. In addition, a trend towards negative correlations following WWB was observed between insulin iAUC (0&#x02013;150&#x000a0;min) and the total WM test; WM:1&#x02013;3, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.056.

Thus, measures to lower these risk factors must thus be taken, not only in prevention of cardiometabolic complications, but also to prevent a concomitant impairment of cognitive decline and depressive symptom. Furthermore, relationships exists between cardiometabolic risk variables and cognitive functions also in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Consequently, it was shown in an apparently healthy cohort of 40 subjects (aged 49&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years), divided in two groups depending on having glucose tolerance below or above the median of the studied group, that performance on WM- and SA tests was superior in the 20 subjects that have higher glucose tolerance compared to the 20 with lower glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similarly it was observed that a progressively worse glucose regulation predicted poorer performance on measures of WM and executive function-in nondiabetic middle aged and older subjects (49&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years). Together these results suggest a progressive decline in cognitive functions and deteriorations prior to glucoregulatory impairment reaches levels consistent with a T2D diagnosis. Thus, both metabolic and cognitive impairments are progressive processes with no sharp cut off values, which is important to be taken into consideration in prevention strategies. As described above and in the <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">Introduction</xref> section, improvements in cardiometabolic risk markers and cognitive performance have previously been reported in healthy subjects after intervention with certain foods. Improvements have been seen on glucose regulation e.g. after short term intervention (1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days) with barley kernel based meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and rye kernels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], thus indicating preventive potential with respect to metabolic diseases and related cognitive decline. A glucose profile characterized by less oscillating glucose concentrations has proven beneficial with respect to prevent acute postprandial insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and it has also been demonstrated in healthy subjects that cognitive functions may be enhanced acutely in the postprandial phase after intake of foods resulting in a metabolically favorable glucose excursion, characterized by a low peak increment but higher postprandial blood glucose concentrations in the late postprandial period, compared with a high glycaemic index food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. One suggested contributing factor to the impaired cognitive functions is a decreased insulin sensitivity that may occur acutely after a high-GI meal, which may affect brain functions, possibly together with decreased glucose supply to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The results from previous studies thus show that cognitive functions may be related to cardiometabolic variables also in apparently healthy subjects, and that foods and diets may affect metabolic risk variables and cognitive functions also in a short term.</p><p id="Par78">The presently described study is the first study to investigate effects of short-term intervention with WG rye-based products on cognitive functions in terms of WM and SA, and mood variables in terms of valence and activation parameters. No significant differences depending on intervention were observed regarding cognitive performance, however, novel findings were observed concerning increased subjective mood ratings after the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 evening meal. Both the mood parameters valence and activation were significantly improved during the experimental day, i.e. 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;h post intake of RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2, indicating that the subjects were more prone towards feeling pleased, glad and happy (valance), and awake, active and peppy (activation) after RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2, compared to WWB. The impact of WG intervention on mood has not previously been widely studied but acute positive effects on mood with increased ratings of happiness and alertness in the postprandial period has been reported after intake of a cereal bar (1.1&#x000a0;g DF per portion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Concomitantly with the improved mood ratings in the current study, the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention also resulted in a significant increase in insulin sensitivity post the following breakfast.</p><p id="Par79">Diabetic patients have increased risk of depression and reversely, those who are depressed have increased risk of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, correlations between mood parameters and postprandial insulin concentrations were observed in the present study. Thus, the results indicated that a higher rating of being &#x02018;happy&#x02019; (the mood rating &#x02018;depressed&#x02019; on the opposite side of the same VAS-scale) was related to a lower iAUC insulin response, especially in the later part of the experimental day, suggesting relationships between insulin sensitivity and mood also in healthy individuals.</p><p id="Par80">In the present study no significant effects were observed on cognitive performance depending on intervention. It can be argued whether the duration of the intervention, i.e. 3&#x000a0;days, was long enough to observe semi-acute effects of RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 compared to WWB on cognitive functions in the healthy middle-aged subjects. However, we observed an inverse correlation between glucose tolerance (iAUC 0&#x02013;150&#x000a0;min) and performance in the SA test at 170&#x000a0;min (correct responses), which is in agreement with previous studies showing relationships between cognitive functions and glucose regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In addition, the observed negative correlation in the current study between postprandial insulin concentrations (iAUC 0&#x02013;150&#x000a0;min) and the performance in the WM test at 120 and 150&#x000a0;min, as well as the positive correlations between increased insulin sensitivity and total WM performance, are important novel findings and can add to the understanding of underlying mechanisms between T2D and increased risk of impaired cognitive functions and mood. In particular the observation indicates a role of foods that facilitate glucose regulation in maintenance of good mood. The correlations between cognitive functions and insulin in this study is in accordance with previous observation in T2D patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease showing improvements in cognitive functions when improving the insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Since the metabolic syndrome and T2D are associated with cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], it would potentially be possible to prevent, and also to some extent reverse, the cognitive impairment related to metabolic dysfunction. In this respect diet strategies for prevention is important and measures to increase intake of WG rye kernel/flour mixture are probably advantageous.</p><p id="Par81">In the present study, we also observed a significant reduction in IL-1&#x003b2; concentrations concomitant with increased concentrations of GLP-2 at fasting after RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2. IL-1&#x003b2; is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and increased concentrations of IL-1&#x003b2; have been observed in obese individuals, and animals with diet-induced obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Further IL-1&#x003b2; is associated with impaired insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. On the contrary, higher GLP-2 concentrations have been reported to be induced in healthy subjects approximately 11&#x000a0;h after intake of non-digestible carbohydrates in e.g. brown beans and barley kernel products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. GLP-2 is involved in the maintenance of gut barrier functions and possesses anti-inflammatory properties by obstructing influx of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gut lumen. According to Cani and coworkers (2009), feeding mice prebiotics (oligofructose) caused increased production of GLP-2 together with lowering of inflammatory markers such as LPS, IL-1 (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) and IL-6, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of GLP-2 due to enhancement of the gut barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In addition, GLP-2 appears to have anti-inflammatory properties also in the brain, i.e. reducing the response of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; in mouse microglial cell line as observed following pre-treatment of the cells with GLP-2 prior to LPS stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. However, in the present study only IL-1&#x003b2; was significantly different depending on intervention product and further investigations are needed to understand the link between fermentation of DF in rye, GLP-2 and inflammatory tonus.</p><p id="Par82">The effects on cardiometabolic risk markers after intake of the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 product in a middle aged cohort is in accordance with results with a similar rye products (including 85% rye kernels (dm)) evaluated in the same time perspective in young healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One exception between the present study and the latter is the somewhat less prominent reduction of postprandial blood glucose and insulin iAUC 0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min post the standardized breakfast in the presently described study. Thus, in the current study intake of RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 in the evening improved the early (0&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min) postprandial glucose- and insulin responses to the standardized breakfast. The study in young adults did not include cognitive tests, and it is possible that the demanding cognitive tests, starting at 30&#x000a0;min post commencing the breakfast, may have interfered with the postprandial glucose concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In contrast to the previous study in young adults, the results in the present study displayed a trend towards increased f-FFA levels post RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.072) compared to WWB. Moreover, in the current study a trend was noticed towards increased TG post RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.065). Elevated FFA concentrations have shown to impair insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In the present study however, we observed significantly increased insulin sensitivity after the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2. Consequently, further studies are needed to investigate the effects of WG rye on TG and FFA in middle-age subjects.</p><p id="Par83">In accordance with the previous study in young healthy subjects (25.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9&#x000a0;years), the rye-based product RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 increased the satiety-inducing gut hormone PYY at fasting 11&#x000a0;h after intake, without significant effects on subjective appetite ratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The results regarding PYY are in accordance with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. PYY and GLP-1 are produced by L-cells in response to food intake and have displayed anti-obesogenic potential. Accordingly, both PYY and GLP-1 administered via peripheral infusions reduced food intake in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, these gut hormones have been ascribed anti-diabetic properties, e.g. GLP-1 is regarded as an incretin hormone and thus have shown to enhance insulin secretion in response to food. Today GLP-1 analogues are included in drug therapy to patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PYY have been suggested as an early predictor of T2D, based on observations where postprandial PYY concentrations are blunted in individuals that are genetically susceptible for T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that PYY has anti-depressant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and GLP-1 has shown to contribute to improve cognitive functions such as memory and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Consequently, upregulation of these gut hormones may positively affect several metabolic, cognitive, and mood aspects. However, despite a slight non-significant increase in GLP-1 (7%), no significant differences in f-GLP-1 levels were observed depending on intervention. It has been shown in young adults that both GLP-1 and PYY are stimulated after a rye kernel based meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] through gut fermentation of DF. Accordingly, the increased concentrations of SCFA and H<sub>2</sub> in the present study, indicate that the gut fermentation activity was higher after the RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 evening meal. Increased formation of acetate and butyrate has also previously been observed after intake of WG rye kernel based evening meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SCFA are suggested to influence colonic L-cells, resulting in stimulation of GLP-1 and PYY release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which is in accordance with the significantly increased concentrations of SCFA and PYY after RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 in this study. Altogether the results from this study suggest that foods rich in specific indigestible carbohydrates, e.g. WG rye based foods, may have the potential to beneficially affect brain functions via colonic fermentation mechanisms, including the &#x0201c;gut-brain axis&#x0201d;. However, evaluations regarding effects on metabolic and cognitive variables should be performed also in longer term interventions to validate solid beneficial effects. Evaluations should preferably be performed also in subject groups with impaired metabolic regulation to investigate possible health benefit that may contribute to prevent further metabolic deterioration, and concomitant decline in cognitive functions and mood parameters.</p><p id="Par84">No increase in BDNF concentrations were observed after RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 despite increased colonic fermentation activity and formation of SCFA and gut hormones. Thus, the results in this study could not support previous observations of increased BDNF in healthy young adults after intervention with WG rye kernel-based bread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The reasons for the inconsistency in results regarding effects of rye bread on BDNF concentrations, and also on GLP-1, compared with previous studies, have to be further investigated, but one reason could be the differences between the compositions of the rye bread products. In the previous study the bread was made from 85% whole rye kernels (dry basis) while the bread in the presently described study instead was made of 43% rye kernels, 43% WG rye flour, and 14% added RS type 2. The results thus suggest that intact structure of the rye kernels would be more favorable with respect to stimulate an increase in BDNF and GLP-1, and supplementation with RS type 2 could not substitute for the botanically encapsulated RS in the whole kernels. An additional explanation to the discrepancy in the results could be the difference in age between the two study groups; middle aged subjects in the current study and young adults (25.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9&#x000a0;years) in the previous study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par85">This is to the best of our knowledge the first study to display improvements on mood ratings post intake of WG rye (kernel/flour mixture) supplemented with RS, along with inverse correlations between mood ratings and insulin response, in middle-aged subjects 11&#x02013;14&#x000a0;h after intake. In addition, the results revealed that short-term RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2 intervention have the potential to improve insulin sensitivity, and increase plasma levels of gut hormones involved in glucose and appetite regulation (PYY). Moreover, levels of GLP-2, involved in gut barrier function, were increased, whereas the inflammatory marker IL-1&#x003b2; was decreased. The increase in fermentation metabolites suggest that the beneficial effects are mediated through gut microbial fermentation of the DF in RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2. Altogether, the results support a view of WG rye products with a kernel and flour mixture having anti-diabetic potential, useful in the prevention of T2D and with the possibility of ameliorating also mood.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p id="Par6">Area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b-</term><def><p id="Par7">Blood-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDNF</term><def><p id="Par8">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par9">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p id="Par10">Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p id="Par11">Correct response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par12">C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p id="Par13">Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DF</term><def><p id="Par14">Dietary fiber</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dm</term><def><p id="Par15">Dry matter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>f-</term><def><p id="Par16">Fasting-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFA</term><def><p id="Par17">Free fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP</term><def><p id="Par18">Glucagon-like peptide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par19">Breath hydrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAMRS2</term><def><p id="Par20">High-amylose maize resistant starch type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOMA-IR</term><def><p id="Par21">Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iAUC</term><def><p id="Par22">Incremental area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p id="Par23">Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iPeak</term><def><p id="Par24">Incremental peak</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISI<sub>composite</sub></term><def><p id="Par25">Insulin sensitivity index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPB</term><def><p id="Par26">Lipopolysaccharide binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPS</term><def><p id="Par27">Lipopolysaccharide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSP</term><def><p id="Par28">Non-starch polysaccharides</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>p-</term><def><p id="Par29">Plasma-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PYY</term><def><p id="Par30">Peptide YY</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS2</term><def><p id="Par31">1:1 ratio rye kernel- and flour based bread with added resistant starch (14%, dm)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RS</term><def><p id="Par32">Resistant starch</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SA</term><def><p id="Par33">Selective attention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCFA</term><def><p id="Par34">Short chain fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par35">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p id="Par36">Standard error mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2D</term><def><p id="Par37">Type 2 diabetes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par38">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WG</term><def><p id="Par39">Whole grain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WM</term><def><p id="Par40">Working memory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WWB</term><def><p id="Par41">White wheat bread</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Biomedical technician, Mrs. L Persson and Laboratory engineer, Mr. C Fahlgren, at Food for Health Science Centre, Lund University, Sweden, are gratefully acknowledged for their skillful technical assistance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par86">This study was funded by the Lund University Antidiabetic Food Centre, a VINNOVA VINN Excellence Centre.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par87">The datasets analyzed during this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows: JCS, IMEB and ACN designed the study; JCS and ACN coordinated the study, performed the majority of the experimental work and the statistical calculations.
