    "We developed a discriminant method based on the stable isotope ratio of carbon and nitrogen (δ13C and δ15N) to evaluate whether monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used in processed food samples. δ13C measurements were performed by elemental analyzer/isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) for on glutamic acid isolated from samples at high purity, and δ15N measurements were performed by gas chromatography/combustion/IRMS (GC/C/IRMS) following the purification and derivatization steps. By applying these methods, the δ13C and δ15N values for glutamic acid present in a wide variety of processed foods were obtained. Subsequently, discriminant analysis, which is a statistical analysis method, was performed by using the δ13C and δ15N values from seasoning MSG and glutamic acid from foodstuffs of known origin, and the discriminant function was derived. By substituting the measured δ13C and δ15N values of processed food samples into this discriminant function and classifying samples into two groups, seasoning MSG (the seasoning group) and glutamic acid in foodstuffs (the foodstuff group), we determined whether seasoning MSG had been used in the processed food samples. As a result, the accuracy of distinguishing between the seasoning group and the foodstuff group was very high, i.e., 96.2%, indicating that the proposed method is a highly robust and accurate method for determining whether seasoning MSG has been used in for processed foods."
