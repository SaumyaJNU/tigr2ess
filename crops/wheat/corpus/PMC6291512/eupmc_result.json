    "Multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations were recently developed to allow the high-resolution mapping of quantitative traits. We present a genetic linkage map of an elite but highly diverse eight-founder MAGIC population in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Our MAGIC population is composed of 394 F6:8 recombinant inbred lines lacking significant signatures of population structure. The linkage map included 5435 SNP markers distributed over 2804 loci and spanning 5230 cM. The analysis of population parameters, including genetic structure, kinship, founder probabilities, and linkage disequilibrium and congruency to other maps indicated appropriate construction of both the population and the genetic map. It was shown that eight-founder MAGIC populations exhibit a greater number of loci and higher recombination rates, especially in the pericentromeric regions, compared to four-founder MAGIC, and biparental populations. In addition, our greatly simplified eight-parental MAGIC mating design with an additional eight-way intercross step was found to be equivalent to a MAGIC design with all 210 possible four-way crosses regarding the levels of missing founder assignments and the number of recombination events. Furthermore, the MAGIC population captured 71.7% of the allelic diversity available in the German wheat breeding gene pool. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated the application of the resource for quantitative trait loci mapping analyzing seedling resistance to powdery mildew. As wheat is a crop with many breeding objectives, this resource will allow scientists and breeders to carry out genetic studies for a wide range of breeder-relevant parameters in a single genetic background and reveal possible interactions between traits of economic importance."
