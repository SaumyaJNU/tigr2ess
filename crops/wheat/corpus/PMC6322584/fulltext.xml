Only a few species, including grapevine (<italic>Vitis</italic>), synthesize and accumulate Res. Although stilbene synthases (STSs) have been isolated and characterized in several species, the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying stilbene biosynthesis are still largely unknown. Here, we characterize a grapevine WRKY transcription factor, VvWRKY8, that regulates the Res biosynthetic pathway. Transient and stable overexpression of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> in grapevine results in decreased expression of <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> and <italic>VvMYB14</italic>, as well as in a reduction of Res accumulation. VvWRKY8 does not bind to or activate the promoters of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> and <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic>; however, it physically interacts with VvMYB14 proteins through their N-terminal domains to prevent them from binding to the <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> promoter. Application of exogenous Res results in the stimulation of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> expression and in a decrease of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> and <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> expression in grapevine suspension cells, and in the activation of the <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> promoter in tobacco leaves. These results demonstrate that VvWRKY8 represses <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> expression and Res biosynthesis through interaction with VvMYB14. In this context, the VvMYB14-VvSTS15/21-Res-VvWRKY8 regulatory loop may be an important mechanism for the fine-tuning of Res biosynthesis in grapevine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fine-tuning</kwd><kwd>grapevine</kwd><kwd>protein interaction</kwd><kwd>resveratrol</kwd><kwd>VvMYB14</kwd><kwd>VvWRKY8</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31171918</award-id><award-id>31672120</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Grape Breeding Project of Ningxia</named-content></funding-source><award-id>NXNYYZ201502</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Resveratrol (Res; 3,5,4&#x02032;-trihydroxystilbene) is a stilbenoid, a class of plant-derived phenolic metabolites with activities against pests, pathogens, and abiotic stresses (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Adrian <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Adrian and Jeandet, 2012</xref>). Res has been extensively studied for its antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic effects, and for its potential roles in chemoprevention of cancer and cardioprotection (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Kalantari and Das, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Pangeni <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Weiskirchen and Weiskirchen, 2016</xref>). However, Res is naturally synthesized in only a few plant species. It was first isolated in 1939 from roots of white hellebore (<italic>Veratrum grandiflorum</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Takaoka, 1939</xref>), and then in 1964 from roots of Japanese knotweed (<italic>Polygonum cuspidatum</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nonomura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1963</xref>). In 1974, it was characterized as a phytoalexin in the leaves of Vitaceae (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Langcake and Pryce, 1976</xref>). The production of this phytoalexin is stimulated when Vitaceae are exposed to fungal infections, ozone, injury, wounding, and UV-C irradiation (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Langcake and Pryce, 1976</xref>). Grapevine (<italic>Vitis</italic>) is currently the main source of supply of Res worldwide because of its extensive cultivation and high production efficiency (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Weiskirchen and Weiskirchen, 2016</xref>). With an increasing demand for a natural source of Res, it is important to determine the gene regulatory pathway controlling its production.</p><p>Res is synthesized in the plant through the phenylalanine/polymalonate pathway, under the synergistic action of a series of related enzymes. Biosynthesis of Res and other phenylpropanoids begins with the synthesis of <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid or its derivative <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid from phenylalanine or tyrosine, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Jez, 2008</xref>). Stilbene synthase (STS; EC2.3.1.95) catalyses the direct formation of Res from three malonyl-CoA units and one <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Austin and Noel, 2003</xref>). Catalysed by glycosyltransferase (3-<italic>O</italic>-&#x003b2;-glycosyltransferases, 3-<italic>O</italic>-GT), Res is then converted into the corresponding glycoside (peceid, Pd). STS belongs to the type-III polyketide synthase enzyme superfamily and shares a high amino acid sequence identity with chalcone synthase (CHS; EC 2.3.1.74) (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Austin and Noel, 2003</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Vannozzi <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> identified 33 full-length sequences encoding <italic>STS</italic> genes in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, which were clustered into three main groups designated as A, B, and C. Compared with those from groups A and C, <italic>VvSTS</italic> genes from group B are highly responsive to abiotic stresses, with wounding resulting in a 7- to 186-fold increase in transcription after 24 h. When grapevine leaf discs are exposed to UV-C light, their <italic>VvSTS</italic> transcription increases by 11- to 27-fold (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Vannozzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms controlling <italic>VvSTS</italic> gene expression remain unclear.</p><p>A limited number of transcription factors (TFs) regulating phenylpropanoid biosynthesis have been identified in a wide range of plant species. In grapevine, two MYB TFs, VvMYB14 and VvMYB15, trans-activate the promoters of <italic>VvSTS29</italic> and <italic>VvSTS41</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;ll <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), and VvMYB14 directly binds to the <italic>VvSTS48</italic> promoter (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Fang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Very recently, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Vannozzi <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> used <italic>V. vinifera</italic> suspension cell cultures to show that VvWRKY24 acts as a singular effector for <italic>VvSTS29</italic> promoter activation whereas VvWRKY3 acts through a combinatorial effect with VvMYB14 only through transient expression. In previous studies, we found that the expression of <italic>VvSTS</italic>s were largely up-regulated and Res concentration increased in leaves of <italic>V. vinifera</italic> after exposure to UV-C irradiation (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Xi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Interestingly, MYB and WRKY TFs such as VvMYB14, VvMYB15, and the previously uncharacterized <italic>V. vinifera</italic> WRKY 57-like (probe set ID: 1610775_s_at; GSVIVT01010525001) are up-regulated by 100- to 200-fold (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Xi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Using gene information from the PLEXdb database and Grape Genome Browser (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">The French&#x02013;Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization, 2007</xref>), we designated this WRKY TF as VvWRKY8 according to the VvWRKY phylogenetic tree (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). WRKY TFs have been well characterized for their roles in regulating the production of valuable natural products such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and terpenes by regulating metabolic pathway genes (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kato <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Guillaumie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Singh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Among the 59 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> WRKYs, VvWRKY2 is known to regulate lignin production (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Guillaumie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), while VvWRKY26 is specific for the control of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Amato <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). We therefore speculated that VvWRKY8 may directly or indirectly regulate <italic>VvSTS</italic> expression.</p><p>In this study, we found that <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> is strongly co-expressed with <italic>VvMYB14</italic> and <italic>VvSTS</italic>s in grapevine leaves after UV-C treatment. Overexpression of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> resulted in decreases of <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> expression and Res accumulation in the leaves. Although VvWRKY8 does not specifically bind to or activate the promoters of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> or <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic>, it physically interacts with VvMYB14 through the N&#x02013;terminal domains of both proteins. The VvWRKY8-VvMYB14 heterodimer prevents the VvMYB14 N-terminal DNA-binding domain from binding to the promoter region of <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic>. In addition, application of exogenous Res induces the expression of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> and decreases the expression of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> and <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> in grapevine suspension cells. Furthermore, it activated the <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> promoter in leaves of tobacco. These results suggest that VvWRKY8 negatively regulates <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> by sequestrating its transcriptional activator, VvMYB14. A regulatory loop involving VvMYB14-VvSTS15/21-Res-VvWRKY8 may act as an important mechanism for the fine-tuning of Res biosynthesis in grapevine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>), and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) were used in this study.

However, the authors excluded any direct interaction between both proteins and further suggested the involvement of an additional &#x02018;bridge&#x02019; protein. Here, we demonstrated that the interaction between VvWRKY8 and VvMYB14 was directly mediated through the N-terminal domains of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To further understand how the VvWRKY8&#x02013;VvMYB14 interaction influences Res biosynthesis, we investigated its effect on the activity of <italic>proVvSTS15/21</italic>. The results indicated that the interaction inhibited the induction effect of VvMYB14 on <italic>proVvSTS15/21</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, B). Moreover, we showed that the inhibition of VvMYB14 by VvWRKY8 was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, we determined that the VvMYB14 DNA-binding domain and activation domain are located in the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, D). In summary, our results showed that in grapevine, VvWRKY8 can decrease <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> expression in order to reduce Res biosynthesis by forming a protein complex with VvMYB14.</p><p>When grapevines are subjected to abiotic and biotic stresses, Res is quickly synthesized; however, its accumulation is not constant (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Douillet-Breuil <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Versari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ferri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Xi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2015<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2015<italic>b</italic></xref>, <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Res is a specialized metabolite with strong antioxidant activity that has a protective effect under stresses; however, accumulation of Res to high levels may damage plant development. Therefore, grapevine might have developed a precise regulatory mechanism that relies on a number of activators and repressors in order to balance Res biosynthesis. We found that overexpression of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> resulted in the accumulation of Res and in the up-regulation of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> expression in grapevine leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>). However, VvMYB14 did not trans-activate the <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). In addition, as shown by <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, upon UV-C treatment the expression peak of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> preceded those of <italic>VvSTS</italic>s and <italic>VvWRKY8</italic>. Summing up these results, we speculate that the accumulation of Res results in up-regulation of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> expression, i.e. there is feedback control between Res and <italic>VvWRKY8</italic>. This hypothesis was confirmed by the 2-fold stimulation of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> expression when exogenous <italic>trans</italic>-Res was added to grapevine suspension cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Moreover, when exogenous <italic>trans</italic>-Res was sprayed onto tobacco leaves transiently expressing <italic>proVvWRKY8::LUC</italic>, the promoter activity was increased by 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate the existence of negative feedback involving the activator VvMYB14, the key enzymes VvSTS15/21, the product Res, and the negative regulator VvWRKY8. Thus, the VvMYB14-VvSTS15/21-Res-VvWRKY8 regulatory loop enables the precise control of <italic>VvSTS15/21</italic> expression levels that are necessary for the regulation of Res biosynthesis (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Data from the literature also show the existence of negative feedback in the control of phytohormone biosynthesis. For example, in peanut, AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 form a protein complex to mediate ABA-dependent negative feedback regulation of <italic>AhNCED1</italic> transcription (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Another mechanism that fine-tunes metabolite biosynthesis is the degradation of transcriptional regulators (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Patra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). We speculate that degradation of VvWRKY8 allows the de-repression of VvMYB14, and leads to the activation of the Res biosynthetic pathway. Indeed, our Y2H screening using VvWRKY8 as a bait led to the identification of several E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase proteasome pathway may be involved in the control of the VvMYB14-VvSTS15/21-Res-VvWRKY8 regulatory loop. In addition, treatment of tobacco leaves transiently expressing <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly increased the amounts of VvWRKY8, further supporting the notion of VvWRKY8 undergoing ubiquitin proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7B</xref>). However, the relationships among Res and the expression or transcript stability of <italic>VvMYB14</italic> and <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> remain open to question. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, overexpression of <italic>VvWRKY8</italic> resulted in a decrease in <italic>VvMYB14</italic> expression. However, VvWRKY8 could not directly regulate <italic>VvMYB14</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that additional bridge proteins could be involved in the <italic>VvMYB14</italic> expression patterns controlled by VvWRKY8. Furthermore, because exogenous Res decreased <italic>VvMYB14</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>, we cannot exclude the possibility that Res accumulation itself represses <italic>VvMYB14</italic> expression or transcript stability rather than through VvWRKY8</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Hypothetical model for the mode of action of the VvMYB14-<italic>VvSTS15/21</italic>-Res-VvWRKY8 regulating loop for the fine-tuning of resveratrol (Res) biosynthesis in grapevine.
