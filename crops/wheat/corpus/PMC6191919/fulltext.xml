The ability of complex microbial communities present in natural environments that are specialized in biomass deconstruction can be exploited to develop lignocellulose bioconversion processes. Termites are among the most abundant insects on earth and play an important role in lignocellulose decomposition. Although their digestive microbiome is recognized as a potential reservoir of microorganisms producing lignocellulolytic enzymes, the potential to enrich and maintain the lignocellulolytic activity of microbial consortia derived from termite gut useful for lignocellulose biorefinery has not been assessed. Here, we assessed the possibility of enriching a microbial consortium from termite gut and maintaining its lignocellulose degradation ability in controlled anaerobic bioreactors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We enriched a termite gut-derived consortium able to transform lignocellulose into carboxylates under anaerobic conditions. To assess the impact of substrate natural microbiome on the enrichment and the maintenance of termite gut microbiome, the enrichment process was performed using both sterilized and non-sterilized straw. The enrichment process was carried out in bioreactors operating under industrially relevant aseptic conditions. Two termite gut-derived microbial consortia were obtained from <italic>Nasutitermes ephratae</italic> by sequential batch culture on raw wheat straw as the sole carbon source. Analysis of substrate loss, carboxylate production and microbial diversity showed that regardless of the substrate sterility, the diversity of communities selected by the enrichment process strongly changed compared to that observed in the termite gut. Nevertheless, the community obtained on sterile straw displayed higher lignocellulose degradation capacity; it showed a high xylanase activity and an initial preference for hemicellulose.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study demonstrates that it is possible to enrich and maintain a microbial consortium derived from termite gut microbiome in controlled anaerobic bioreactors, producing useful carboxylates from raw biomass. Our results suggest that the microbial community is shaped both by the substrate and the conditions that prevail during enrichment. However, when aseptic conditions are applied, it is also affected by the biotic pressure exerted by microorganisms naturally present in the substrate and in the surrounding environment. Besides the efficient lignocellulolytic consortium enriched in this study, our results revealed high levels of xylanase activity that can now be further explored for enzyme identification and overexpression for biorefinery purposes.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13068-018-1282-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lignocellulose</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic microbial consortium</kwd><kwd>Termite gut microbiome</kwd><kwd>Carboxylates</kwd><kwd>Xylanase</kwd><kwd>Cellulase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Region Languedoc-Roussillon Midi-Pyr&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;es</institution></funding-source><award-id>31000553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auer</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>French National Agency for Energy and Environment</institution></funding-source><award-id>TEZ 12-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazuka</surname><given-names>Ad&#x000e8;le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>French National Institute for Agronomical Research</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Carnot Institute 3BCAR</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Lignocellulose (LC) is the major component of the plant cell walls and constitutes the most abundant biomass on Earth. As such, LC is a renewable carbon resource that can be used to produce energy and commodity chemicals. A survey of natural ecosystems in which lignocellulose decomposition occurs reveals that the digestive systems of herbivores are particularly efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To digest biomass, herbivores benefit from symbiotic relationships with microbial communities that have been selected by millennial evolutionary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the herbivores, termites are of particular interest since their digestive systems can be likened to highly efficient lignocellulolytic microscale bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Termites are among the most abundant insects on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They play an important role in the decomposition of plant material and global carbon recycling. Over the last&#x02009;~&#x02009;150 million years, termites have developed various symbiotic strategies to digest lignocellulosic material, including highly lignified hardwood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. All termite species have in common that their guts contain microbial symbionts that contribute to nitrogen regulation and deliver fermentative products from biomass, such as acetate, propionate and other volatile fatty acids (VFA or carboxylates), as carbon and energy sources for their termite host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In return, the microbiome benefits from a stable environment and supply of nutrients.</p><p id="Par6">In higher termites, such as the wood-feeding subfamily Nasutermitinae, the digestive tract can be described as a &#x0201c;dual cellulose digestion system&#x0201d;, consisting of three major compartments&#x02014;the foregut, midgut and hindgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The foregut and midgut can be seen as small enzymatic bioreactors, where highly alkaline conditions and host-endogenous cellulases partially hydrolyze cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, the hindgut is more voluminous and usually displays a neutral or slightly acidic pH (pH 6&#x02013;7). In the hindgut, hemicellulose and residual cellulose are metabolized by a symbiotic microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Indeed, recent investigations on <italic>Nasutitermes</italic> spp. showed that up to 50% of total cellulase activity in the hindgut was produced by the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is within the hindgut paunch that lignocellulolytic bacteria degrade plant fiber, deploying a rich diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For these reasons, the study of termite gut microbiomes is of considerable interest, in particular for biorefinery applications. Selecting microbial consortia from these environments, which naturally produce VFA as end products instead of converting them into methane, represents an opportunity to improve the carboxylate platform.</p><p id="Par7">To reveal the biomass degradation potential of termite gut microbiomes and to identify the microbial species and enzymes involved in such processes, previous studies have applied culture-dependent approaches, enabling the isolation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria belonging to different taxa including <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. More recently, culture-independent &#x0201c;omics&#x0201d; methodologies have provided new insight into the composition of termite microbiomes and revealed a vast diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The diversity of termite gut microbiome seems to vary in function of the diet and phylogeny of termites, but a dominance of phyla Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes and the candidate phylum Termite Group 3 (TG3) has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Using a metagenomics approach, Warnecke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] revealed that the hindgut paunch of <italic>Nasutitermes</italic> species was mainly constituted by phylotypes related to the genus <italic>Treponema</italic> (Spirochaetes phylum) and the phylum Fibrobacteres; these phylotypes were identified as implicated on lignocellulose degradation as they code for diverse endoglucanases as well as for domains related to the catalytic site of glycoside hydrolases. Firmicutes also participate in lignocellulose transformation as they code numerous glycoside hydrolases belonging to the family 11 (GH11) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In the biorefinery context, there is strong interest in the ability of microbial consortia to transform raw lignocellulosic biomass into valuable products such as methane, hydrogen or volatile fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To this end, efficient microbial consortia displaying target bioconversion features have been obtained by sequential enrichment culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and different inoculates, including microorganisms from soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], compost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and cow rumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, despite the renowned potency of termite digestive systems, the use of these to artificially generate lignocellulolytic consortia has so far attracted little attention.</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this study was to assess the <italic>Nasutitermes ephratae</italic> gut microbiome as a source of inoculum for an enrichment strategy on wheat straw to produce VFA. Previously, we have established that the microbiome from this species can be used to efficiently degrade wheat straw in bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we set out to enrich and stabilize this wheat straw-degrading ability using a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) approach, operating under strict anaerobic conditions. To assess the impact of the endogenous microflora of raw substrate on the selection and maintenance of a termite-derived consortium, the enrichment processes were performed using both sterile (SS) and non-sterile (NSS) wheat straw as sole carbon sources. To simulate conditions that could be applied at industrial scale, bioreactors were operated under aseptic conditions. The microbial diversity during the enrichment process using both SS and NSS was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Impact of substrate sterilization on enrichment of microbial consortia</title><p id="Par10">Sequencing batch reactor enrichment has been previously used to successfully select more efficient lignocellulose-degrading consortia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, to enrich the lignocellulolytic function of the <italic>N. ephratae</italic>-derived inoculum (hereafter called termite microbiome or TM), it was cultured in SBR mode using both milled sterile (SS) and non-sterile (NSS) raw wheat straw as sole carbon source. To simulate conditions that can be found at industrial scale, all enrichment experiments were performed in aseptic bioreactors. As the initial TM was produced on sterile substrate in two independent bioreactors (TMa and TMb), the first cycle of enrichment (C1) in both substrates was compared to assess the impact of the eventual differences in TM community composition, the endogenous wheat straw microbiome and the aseptic bioreactor conditions on biomass degradation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Characterization of the first cycle of enrichment (C1) of TM on SS and NSS. <bold>a</bold> VS degradation, <bold>b</bold> VFA production, <bold>c</bold> xylanase and <bold>d</bold> CMCase activities</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2018_1282_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par11">From an early phase of incubation, a different behavior of TM in each substrate (sterilized or not) was quite patent, because after only 3&#x000a0;days of incubation significantly higher levels of substrate degradation and VFA production were observed when using SS (C1 SS, 25.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.7% VS and 95.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x000a0;mCmol VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) compared to experiments with NSS (C1 NSS, 14.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.4% VS and 68.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.5&#x000a0;mCmol VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). Likewise, at the end of incubation, the overall wheat straw degradation (VS) was higher in the case of bioreactors containing SS compared to those containing NSS. However, at the end-point VFA production was similar for both substrates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). Taking into account that TOC measurements confirmed the absence of metabolites other than VFA in the fermentation broth, the difference in conversion yield (i.e., wheat straw to carboxylates) can be correlated with the significantly higher CO<sub>2</sub> production observed in reactors containing SS compared to those containing NSS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).</p><p id="Par12">The effect of substrate sterility on key lignocellulolytic enzymes was assessed measuring xylanase and CMCase activities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d). In the reactor containing SS, a higher xylanase activity was measured, with maximum activity (2.3&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) being observed at day 4. In the case of NSS, maximum xylanase activity was reached after day 5 and was 30% lower than that observed on SS. Thereafter, xylanase activity decreased in all the bioreactors, but a sharper decline was observed in those containing NSS compared to SS. Similarly, the maximum CMCase activity was higher and occurred earlier when the microbial consortium was grown on SS compared to NSS. However, unlike the xylanase activity, once maximal CMCase activity was achieved it remained quite stable over time, irrespective of the substrate used.</p><p id="Par13">During the first cycle of TM enrichment on wheat straw, lignocellulose degradation was on average 40.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.0% and 47.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.0% of VS when growing on NSS and SS, respectively. The production of VFA followed a similar tendency, with similar production (190&#x000a0;mCmol VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in all cultures. Since these results are representative of the initial LC degradation potential of TM, it was expected that they would constitute a basis for further functional enhancement through SBR enrichment.</p><p id="Par14">In the case of the cultures growing on NSS, subsequent enrichment cycles revealed that lignocellulolytic capability declined, dropping to 30.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9% of VS at the end of the second cycle, while VFA production decreased by 20% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, C2). At the end of the SBR enrichment process, cultures growing on NSS displayed a potential for VS degradation and VFA production that were approximately 30% lower than those observed after the first cycle. In the case of cultures growing on SS, the decline in VS degradation and VFA production was much less pronounced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After five enrichment cycles on SS, VS degradation had stabilized at 37.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2% VS and VFA production at around 167&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.08&#x000a0;mCmol-VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Therefore, although enrichment on SS did not reinforce the initial lignocellulolytic activity, it stabilized and was maintained at a high level (80% and 88% of the initial VS degradation and VFA production, respectively). The stabilized consortium produced using SS was thereafter referred to as TWS.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Effect of substrate sterility on wheat straw degradation (VS, bars) and carboxylate production (VFA, squares) during the enrichment process of termite-derived microbiome.

</p><p id="Par16">The diversity profiles showed that the initial termite gut inocula, dominated by <italic>Spirochaetes</italic> and <italic>Fibrobacteres</italic>, shifted after the first culture on wheat straw (TM), being largely dominated by <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Weighted UniFrac distance of OTUs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) showed that while the initial communities were close (C1 NSS or SS), they diverged throughout the enrichment process.

Analyzing in more detail the community composition, from Cycle 1, the abundance of members related to <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> genus (Bacteroidetes phyla) strongly increased at the expense of Firmicutes, with both SS and NSS wheat straw. Subsequent enrichment cycles presented a similar, stable diversity profile, with small variations of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes content. During the enrichment processes, it is remarkable that termite-derived communities were significantly distant from the initial termite gut inocula.

The stabilized community TWS achieved on average 41.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9% VS degradation and a production of 179.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.1&#x000a0;mCmol&#x000a0;VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 11&#x000a0;days incubation, representing about 87&#x02013;95% of the respective values observed in C1 SS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). The main differences between C1 SS and TWS were observed during the early phase of incubation, with TWS displaying higher lignocellulose degradation and VFA production rates compared to C1 SS. Indeed, at day 2, substrate degradation of TWS was twice that measured in C1 SS (30.4 and 14.8% VS degradation, respectively). Similarly, TWS displayed a higher VFA production during the first days of incubation compared to C1 SS (about 158.0 vs 120.6&#x000a0;mCmol VFA&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on day 4, respectively). TWS also displayed a greater ability to remove hemicellulose compared to C1 SS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), with the maximal degradation rate being observed in day 1 (29.6%&#x000a0;Cmol&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), whereas C1 SS displayed a lower value (17.0%&#x000a0;Cmol&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) that was reached on day 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).

</p><p id="Par18">Regarding cellulose degradation, although C1 SS and TWS displayed similar global cellulose degradation profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), examination of the early phase (day 3) revealed that TWS attained 20% higher cellulose degradation rate compared to C1 SS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Similarly, on day 2, cellulose degradation by TWS was 80% higher than that achieved by C1 SS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Overall, it is possible to conclude that TWS preferentially degraded hemicellulose, although both cellulose and hemicellulose degradation were enhanced and occurred sooner than in the first enrichment cycle (C1 SS). Likewise, the data indicate that hemicellulose hydrolysis sharply declined after day 4, whereas cellulose degradation declined progressively over a longer period of time up to day 10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a&#x02013;d). This observation is even more pronounced for TWS community compared to C1 SS.</p><p id="Par19">Regarding the dynamics of enzyme activities, both CMCase (endoglucanase activity) and xylanase activities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, f) displayed profiles composed of three distinct phases. After a short lag phase, both activities sharply increased over an initial period, reaching a maximum, and then decreased slowly. The maximal values achieved for CMCase and xylanase activities were 60% and 22%, respectively, and were higher for TWS. It is noteworthy that while cellulose degradation and CMCase activity reached maximum values at the same time in the case of both C1 SS and TWS, the higher CMCase activity observed in TWS did not correlate with higher cellulose degradation. This is probably related to the availability and recalcitrance of the residual cellulose. In contrast, the hemicellulose degradation rates observed in reactors C1 SS and TWS correlated well with increased xylanase activity. Moreover, in TWS a higher xylanase activity corresponded to a higher hemicellulose degradation rate. This is apparently the main benefit of enrichment of the TWS consortium.</p><p id="Par20">To correlate the lignocellulose degradation ability of TWS to its diversity, we studied diversity changes throughout a lignocellulose degradation cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

In the present case, the key determinants were the ability to grow on wheat straw as the sole carbon source and outcompete natural microflora present on wheat straw, or in the surrounding environment (i.e., in the case of bioreactors carried out under aseptic conditions). Irrespective of substrate sterility, we observed that the initial microbial diversity present in the termite gut was radically altered during the enrichment process on wheat straw, implying that the substrate and the aseptic, anaerobic conditions of the bioreactor constituted the major determinant of the final outcome. Indeed, the communities developed during the C1 cycle on both NSS and SS, displayed very similar composition with a high abundance of Bacteroidetes (mainly <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> members). In all bioreactors, this phylum replaced the Firmicutes members that were present in the original TM inocula. In this respect it is noteworthy that, although culturing was performed under strictly sterile condition, the community composition of TM was already different from that of the actual termite gut, which is mainly constituted of Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres. Further enrichment cycles under aseptic conditions resulted in stronger diversity changes that were accompanied by a decrease in lignocellulose degradation capacity and VFA production, particularly when NSS was used as substrate. Presumably, these changes can be attributed to faster growth of microorganisms that possess the greatest adaptability to the prevailing conditions, meaning that Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres present in the termite gut and Firmicutes members present in TM were not among these. Significantly, the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes that became abundant during the enrichment process only represented minor components of the original termite gut microflora. The appearance of these was probably promoted by their ability to consume the available nutrients. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the genera <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella,</italic> enriched during the cultivation process on wheat straw, are known to be lignocellulose degraders that possess high growth rates and thus possess significant advantages over the slower growing microorganisms in the unstabilized community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is also plausible that microorganisms present in the environment or the endogenous microflora of wheat straw (in the case of NSS) exerted strong pressure on the original termite gut microbiome, preventing its full establishment in the bioreactors. The progressive decline in the aptitude of the consortium grown on NSS to degrade lignocellulose seems to be the result of changes in microbial diversity. This was previously suggested by Reddy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Lazuka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], who reported strong changes in microbial diversity during the enrichment process. This in turn would explain the decline of xylanase production, which obviously impacts lignocellulose degradation. In the case of NSS, the wheat straw endogenous bacteria probably competed with the lignocellulolytic microorganisms present in the original inoculum, resulting in the faster decline of lignocellulose degradation capability in the subsequent enrichment cycles compared to SS. Several studies have shown a strong &#x0201c;substrate effect&#x0201d; on community composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], which drives community selection. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the enrichment process on wheat straw generated similarities (at species/OTU level) between the communities developed on NSS and SS bioreactors. Nevertheless, diversity analysis also revealed differences between the NSS- and SS-related communities, which can be correlated with dissimilar lignocellulose-degrading capacities. Indeed, although high abundances of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> were observed in both substrates throughout the enrichment processes, the abundance of <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> genus was higher in non-sterile straw, while unclassified <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Rikenellaceae</italic> RC9 were more abundant in the enrichment with sterile straw. These two families were dominated by unique OTUs (i.e., OTU<sub>3</sub> and OTU<sub>2</sub>). In the case of OTU<sub>3</sub>, it presents 100% identity to a novel Clostridia isolated from a biogas reactor and described as a cellulose degrader, which has temporarily been classified as <italic>Clostridium</italic> (GenBank: LN868251.1; unpublished). Numerous species of <italic>Clostridium</italic> have previously been reported as displaying cellulase and hemicellulose activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Similarly, OTU<sub>2</sub> presents 100% identity with an uncultured fiber-associated rumen bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Rikenellaceae is a not well-described family with only two genera identified as displaying a tolerance to growth under acidic conditions and presenting an anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, these albeit sparse data correlate with the higher lignocellulose degradation levels observed in SS compared to NSS bioreactors.</p><p id="Par22">It is noteworthy that a previous study focused on a cellulose-degrading community (H-C) derived from soil, Feng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that substrate sterilization had little impact on the outcome of the enrichment process. Using autoclaved and non-autoclaved corn stover (milled 40 mesh&#x02009;=&#x02009;375&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m size), the authors reported degradation levels of 52.8% and 50.8%, respectively. However, unlike in the present study, it is noteworthy that before testing the consortium on non-sterile corn stover, Feng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] performed enrichment exclusively on a sterile substrate (autoclaved filter paper). This implies that the enriched consortium was already stabilized before it was confronted with a non-sterile substrate. These observations have important implications for enriching lignocellulolytic communities from particular environments such as termite gut: to enrich such communities successfully, they should be protected as much as possible from other microorganisms such as those naturally present in wheat straw or in the surrounding environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Characterization of TWS enriched in sterilized wheat straw</title><p id="Par23">The diversity of the most efficient termite-derived consortium TWS, obtained after five cycles of enrichment on sterilized wheat straw, was rather low, with mainly Bacteroidetes members belonging to four main genera, representing up to 95% of the community composition. Such strong selection could be explained by the loss of the major part of the initial inoculum, unable to grow fast enough in the prevailing fermentation conditions. Indeed, bioreactor conditions are far from the conditions prevailing in termite gut where the host consumes free sugars and VFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Here, while the bioreactor&#x02019;s pH was rather similar to that found in <italic>Nasutitermes</italic> gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], bioreactors are perfectly mixed systems which differ from the conditions prevailing in termite gut; other factors such as unsatisfied nutrient or O<sub>2</sub> requirements, altered host relationship or inter-taxa dependency might also explain the differences observed with respect to the initial inoculum. Termites are known to be very efficient lignocellulose degraders, displaying between 74 and 99% cellulose and 65 and 87% hemicellulose degradation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such degradation levels are high compared to those observed in TWS enrichment which displayed 57.8% cellulose and 52.4% hemicellulose degradation levels. The difference observed between the diversity of termite gut inoculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the shift of diversity during the enrichment process and the final TWS diversity might explain the lower lignocellulose degradation rates finally observed in TWS. It also suggests that, by modifying the culture conditions in bioreactors, it could be possible to increase the lignocellulose degradation performances to attain maximal termite gut capacities. Nevertheless, LC degradation and VFA production capabilities of the enriched consortium TWS were higher or comparable to those previously reported using artificial ecosystems. For example, using a rumen fluid inoculum, Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] observed 11% degradation of raw napier grass (initial concentration 1.5% w/v). Another study that employed a soil inoculum growing in aerobic conditions reported degradation levels of 47.7, 43.8 and 43.3% when growing on 1% (w/v) switchgrass, corn stover and wheat straw, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, this study did not report VFA production levels. Similarly, using a soil-enriched consortium growing at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C under static conditions (i.e., not strict anaerobic), Feng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported 51% degradation of a fine (40 mesh) corn stover powder (1% w/v initial concentration). In this case, substrate degradation was accompanied by a very low VFA production, probably due to the non-strict anaerobic conditions applied. Using a compost-derived microbial consortium (XDC-2), Hui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] measured 39.6%, 25.2% and 17.6% degradation of 1% (w/v) rice straw, wheat straw and corn stover, respectively. Finally, in a recent study Sheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] reported the enrichment of a microbial consortium derived from <italic>Holotrichia parallela</italic> (dark black chafer) that rapidly and efficiently (83% degradation over a 3-day period, 1% w/v initial concentration) degraded NaOH-pretreated rice straw. However, metabolite production was not monitored. In summary, it is quite difficult to compare results from different studies, because substrates, substrate pretreatment and culture conditions are generally different. Moreover, in previous studies the aim was often the production of enzymes rather than metabolites, such as carboxylates. Nevertheless, considering the initial substrate concentration reported in these studies, the best performance was reported by Sheng et al. (8.3&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rice straw degradation in 3&#x000a0;days) using a alkali-pretreated rice straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In the same period, TWS degraded 6.2&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of un-pretreated wheat straw. We can conclude that the lignocellulolytic capability of TWS is comparatively high.</p><p id="Par24">In this study, substrate sterilization has been identified as a positive factor for lignocellulose degradation. However, it is important to note that autoclaving might have modified the substrate, increasing its degradability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, considering the relative lability of the different components, the dry conditions applied and the low temperature employed for substrate sterilization (121&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) were relatively mild and would not have engendered significant structural or chemical modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For example, Lawther et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] showed that steam treatment at 120&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C during 15&#x02013;300&#x000a0;min did not have a significant impact on the chemical composition of wheat straw. Similarly, Garrote et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] demonstrated that temperatures above 200&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C were needed to degrade cellulose by steam treatment. In the present study, as autoclaving was carried out under dry conditions, it could be expected that the eventual impact of autoclaving, mainly driven by water ionization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], would be very weak. Therefore, it appears reasonable to mostly attribute increased hemicellulose degradation to the reinforcement of this function during the enrichment process, which favored xylanase activity in TWS. Similar results have been reported by Guo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], who observed that specific hemicellulose degradation was correlated with increased xylanase activity (maximum 8.454&#x000a0;U&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) with an enriched soil consortium (XDC-2). XDC-2 removed 77.1% of rice straw hemicellulose after 3&#x000a0;days, but the cellulose fraction was poorly degraded (11.2%, progressing to 36.7% removal after 12&#x000a0;days), with a constant low level of CMCase activity (0.5&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Compared to XDC-2, the degree of hemicellulose degradation by TWS was significantly lower (52.4% vs 77.1%, respectively), but TWS also degraded cellulose (57.9%), which is the main polysaccharide in the biomass. Interestingly, this function of TWS was the result of a CMCase activity that was about one-fifth of the maximum activity measured in the XDC-2 experiment. The XDC-2 consortium has also been tested on raw wheat straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In this case, a poor degradation level was achieved (25.2%), which compares unfavorably with the TWS consortium. From an industrial standpoint, TWS produces enzymes active on both cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of wheat straw and TWS operates in anaerobic conditions, thus obviating the need for aeration.</p><p id="Par25">In a previous study, we have reported the enrichment of an anaerobic rumen-derived microbial consortium, RWS, which displayed good lignocellulose degradation capability and VFA production on raw wheat straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. When RWS was grown on NaOH-pretreated wheat straw, high xylanase (1.2&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and CMCase (0.05&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) activities were measured. Therefore, it is noteworthy that TWS achieved higher or comparable levels of enzyme activity (2.9&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for xylanase and 0.05&#x000a0;UA&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for CMCase) when acting on raw wheat straw. Consistently, TWS displayed a higher hemicellulose degradation rate (29.6% per day) than RWS (14.6% per day). These results strongly suggest that TWS is a better purveyor of xylanase and, to a lesser extent, CMC-degrading enzymes compared to RWS.</p><p id="Par26">Compared to other enriched lignocellulolytic communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the rather simple community profile of TWS allows the establishment of putative correlations between degradation parameters and specific OTUs. Considering the 16S rRNA transcript levels as an indicator of bacterial activity, two OTUs, OTU<sub>1</sub> (<italic>Bacteroides</italic>) and OTU<sub>3</sub> (<italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, potentially <italic>Clostridium</italic>), accounting for up to 80% of the 16S rRNA relative abundance in the system, appeared extremely active. The temporal dynamics of OTU<sub>1</sub> were well correlated with maximum lignocellulose degradation and xylanase activity (until a plateau was reached). Therefore, OTU<sub>1</sub> appears to be responsible for the strong hemicellulose degradation observed at the initial phase of incubation. In contrast, OTU<sub>3</sub> did not display any correlation with wheat straw degradation, but it correlated well with CMCase activity, suggesting its implication in cellulose degradation. Although the enzyme activity measurements performed reflect the overall enzymatic potential of the system, they do not enable the identification of the individual enzymes involved, nor do they provide the means to relate them to specific microbial taxa. Nevertheless, given that Firmicutes are known to produce a larger repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) than Bacteroidetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], it is plausible that there is interplay between <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, which were constantly present throughout wheat straw degradation.

The reactors were flushed with nitrogen after inoculation; the absence of dissolved oxygen was monitored with a polarographic dissolved oxygen probe (AppliSens). Bioreactors were operated at constant temperature (35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and pH (6.15), the latter being controlled by the addition of an alkali solution (1&#x000a0;M NaOH).</p><p id="Par31">To progressively enrich LC-degrading microbial consortia, two parallel batch bioreactors were inoculated (10% v/v) with TM (thawed overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and fed with SS or NSS as the sole carbon source. These two reactors, representing the first enrichment cycle (SS C1 and NSS C1), were operated until VFA production was stable. Subsequent enrichment cycles were inoculated (10% v/v) with a fraction from the previous cycle and were incubated over 11-day periods using SS or NSS as the carbon source. After the first enrichment cycle, duplicate experiments (two SS C2 reactors and two NSS C2, respectively) using either substrate were initiated by the inoculation (10% v/v) of two parallel bioreactors with the culture obtained from the relevant C1 cycle. After five enrichment cycles, VFA production was stabilized. At this stage, samples (200&#x000a0;mL) of termite-enriched consortia were snap frozen under liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. To simulate conditions that can be found at industrial scale, enrichment experiments were carried under aseptic conditions; before use, bioreactors were cleaned by immersion in a concentrated bleach solution.</p><p id="Par32">To characterize the dynamics of LC degradation by the highest performing microbial consortium (i.e., the one obtained through enrichment on sterile straw), samples were thawed overnight at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and used as inocula for further experiments. To further characterize LC degradation by this consortium, bioreactors were operated as biological duplicates for 11&#x000a0;days using operating conditions identical to those described above. To assess the impact of enrichment on LC degradation, the kinetics of the culture were compared to those of the initial culture (i.e., SS C1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Chemical analyses</title><p id="Par33">Total solids (TS) were determined by centrifuging (7197&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>, 10&#x000a0;min) a sample (10&#x000a0;mL) removed from bioreactors. The solid pellet was rinsed twice with distilled water and dried at 105&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h.
