Environmental conditions such as high temperature (above 30&#x000b0;C) could affect wheat production negatively. Plants from two wheat genotypes have been subjected to two growth temperature regimes. One set has been grown at an optimum daily mean temperature of 19&#x000b0;C while the second set of plants has been subjected to warming at 27&#x000b0;C from two to 13 days after anthesis (daa). While warming did not affect mean grain number per spike, it significantly reduced other yield-related indicators such as grain width, length, volume and maximal cell numbers in the endosperm. Whole genome expression analysis identified 6,258 and 5,220 genes, respectively, whose expression was affected by temperature in the two genotypes. Co-expression analysis using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis) uncovered modules (groups of co-expressed genes) associated with agronomic traits. In particular, modules enriched in genes related to nutrient reservoir and endopeptidase inhibitor activities were found to be positively associated with cell numbers in the endosperm. A hypothetical model pertaining to the effects of warming on gene expression and growth in wheat grain is proposed. Under moderately high temperature conditions, network analyses suggest a negative effect of the expression of genes related to seed storage proteins and starch biosynthesis on the grain size in wheat.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>PIA Breedwheat</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the BreedWheat project (ANR-10-BTBR-0003).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the fifth Assessment Report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/</ext-link>), global surface temperature change, for the end of the 21st century, is projected to exceed 1.5&#x000b0;C to 2&#x000b0;C depending on the RCP scenario (Representative Concentration Pathways). The rise in the average global temperature will be associated with a higher frequency and a longer duration of heat waves on daily and seasonal timescales. These changes are likely to have negative effects on the yield of major crops such as bread wheat [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With an annual production reaching roughly 729 million tons in 2014 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E">http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E</ext-link>), wheat is the third largest crop in the world, growing in many different environments and providing one fifth of the calories consumed by humans. In a global warming context, and as the extension of the wheat growing areas is limited, increased wheat productivity is needed to guarantee future food security [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Wheat crops are sensitive to environmental variations and reduced grain yields are expected when crops are subjected to high temperatures during the reproductive phase, and, in particular, a few days before and after the anthesis [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, Lobell <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have quantified the impact of heat stress to a global loss of 5.5% in wheat yields, and a total loss of 35 million tons worldwide. In a recent study, Tack <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] surveyed the performance of 268 wheat varieties over the years 1985&#x02013;2013 in non-irrigated fields in Kansas, US. They found that warming causes an overall negative effect and that temperatures above 34&#x000b0;C during the springtime lead to the largest reductions in yield.</p><p>Several reviews discuss the effect of post-anthesis elevated temperatures on wheat grain yield [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Depending on the timing, intensity and duration of their occurrence, high temperatures can reduce the number of grains per ear [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and/or the final grain dry mass [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The reduction in final grain mass generally results from a shortening of the grain filling period. In most cases, this reduction in the duration of grain filling is not fully compensated by an increase in the rate of grain dry matter accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], depending on the genotype and on the degree of reduction in grain number per ear [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>When subjected to post-anthesis high temperatures, alterations in the timing of grain development result from the different effects on the various processes occurring within the grain. A wheat grain consists of three main compartments: the outer layers, the endosperm and the embryo. The development of the wheat grain is classically divided into three phases [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]: i) the early or lag-phase (also named enlargement phase), ii) the filling-phase and iii) the maturation-desiccation phase. The first phase includes double fertilization of the ovule, giving rise to both the embryo and the endosperm. It is followed in the endosperm by rapid cellularization and cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. During this phase, the dry mass of an individual grain increases slowly and the enlargement of the grain structure results mainly from the rapid influx of water into the endosperm. This phase is complete within about 15 daa depending on the wheat genotype and the environment. At the end of this phase, the grain length is set definitively, the grain water content has reached its maximum value, and cell proliferation ends in the endosperm [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199434.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During the filling-phase (from &#x0223c;15 daa to &#x0223c;35 daa), cell expansion in the endosperm allows the grains to fill with starch and storage proteins and the grain dry mass increases linearly meanwhile the water mass of the grain remains steady (water plateau). At the end of this phase, the maximal grain dry mass is set and the grain has reached physiological maturity. During the last phase, protein and starch deposition ceases, the grain undergoes a period of maturation, rapidly desiccates and the endosperm tissue undergoes apoptosis.</p><p>The duration of the lag-phase associated with maximal endosperm cell number or that of the filling-phase associated with maximum dry matter or protein accumulation into the grain, can serve to identify specific stages of grain development. As suggested by Altenbach [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], these developmental markers that can be affected by high temperatures, can provide a framework for studying the molecular changes occurring during grain development in response to environmental variations.</p><p>The molecular and cellular response of plants to heat stress has been widely addressed in the literature. In particular, it is commonly found that heat stress induces the accumulation of Heat-Shock Proteins (HSPs) under the control of Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, several other cellular processes are affected by heat stress. For example, studies on rice found that heat responsive genes in panicles [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and flag leaves [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were mainly involved in transcriptional regulation, transport, protein binding and antioxidant.</p><p>In maturing tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) microspores, Frank <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that HSPs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, hormones, and sugars were involved in responses to heat stress. In <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> L., two-week-old seedlings or eight-week-old plants were subjected to a heat stress at 42&#x000b0;C for one and for five hours. These treatments resulted in the alteration of 6,609 genes representing one-fourth of the gene content of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>distachyon</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are involved in various pathways such as photosynthesis, protein folding and protein dephosphorylation. Similarly, 958 genes were induced and 1,122 others were repressed in barley caryopses exposed to 42&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As expected, the set corresponding to heat-induced genes was enriched in GO terms &#x02018;response to stress&#x02019; and &#x02018;response to biotic and abiotic&#x02019; stress.</p><p>In wheat, Qin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] identified a total of 6,560 probe sets that displayed changes in expression after heat treatment at 40&#x000b0;C with or without acclimatation at 34&#x000b0;C. This set included HSPs, HSFs, and gene encoding proteins involved in phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling, calcium, sugar signal pathways, RNA metabolism, ribosomal proteins, as well as primary and secondary metabolisms. Later, wheat tolerant genotype TAM107 was subjected to a severe heat stress (40&#x000b0;C for one and for six hours), drought stress or both of these combined [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. They identified 29,395 differentially expressed genes in at least one stress condition compared to the control, among which 2,468 were affected only by heat stress (up- and down-regulated genes). However, they also found a large proportion of genes common to several stresses. In particular, analysis of GO terms enrichment indicated that some functional pathways were commonly regulated by drought stress, heat stress and heat plus drought stress. For instance, response to abiotic stress, response to hormones (ABA, JA, ethylene and GA) and carbohydrate metabolism were all enriched in commonly up-regulated genes, whereas GO terms related to photosynthesis were enriched in commonly down-regulated genes. Wan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] submitted wheat developing caryopses to moderately high temperature (28&#x000b0;C), to dry conditions as well as to dry and hot conditions finding that most environmental treatment effects on transcription were due to acceleration of development, but that a few transcripts were specifically affected.</p><p>While the effects of temperature are widely studied in plants, they are mainly addressed after a severe heat stress (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic> non-physiological temperatures) in leaves [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, the effects of a high, but physiological (not a heat shock), temperature on grain development in cereals are less documented.</p><p>In the present study, we surveyed a few agronomic traits during wheat grain development in response to low and moderately high temperatures called thereafter warming (19&#x000b0;C vs 27&#x000b0;C) in two genotypes. We also used NimbleGen microarray containing 40,656 UniGenes to characterize differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The results obtained suggest that warming (27&#x000b0;C), imposed from two to 13 daa induces an earlier expression of genes related to nutrients accumulation. In turn, the earlier onset of the nutrients accumulation process may be the signal for an accelerated development rate of the grain. The subsequent effect of these events is a net reduction in grain yield.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>SxB49 and SxB139 are two <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between two elite spring wheat varieties; Seri M82 and Babax [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

For grain phenotyping and morphological measurements, grains were sampled i) at the beginning of the filling-phase (around 300&#x000b0;Cd, stage estimated from previous experiments (not shown)) and ii) at maturity. Only basal grains, grains #1 (G1) and # (G2) on the central spikelet of the ear, were sampled. At both stages (&#x0223c;300&#x000b0;Cd and maturity), G1 and G2 grains were fresh weighed and their volume was determined using a water displacement method (pycnometry). Dorsal and lateral images of the grains were acquired under a stereomicroscope in order to measure the length, width and thickness of each grain at a later date. Then, for the grains sampled at &#x0223c;300&#x000b0;Cd, G1 were oven-dried at 65&#x000b0;C for 48h, then weighed to give the dry mass (DM). After sampling, G2 were immediately dissected and the endosperms isolated. The endosperms were then fixed at room temperature in a 1:3 (v/v) acetic acid-alcohol mixture.

They also contained respectively 10 and 11 genes coding for proteins involved in grain quality such as grain softness protein (Ta#S32594136) and puroindoline (Ta#S50384070).</p><p>In addition, the two modules shared genes related to stress response in wheat grain such as alpha-amylase inhibitor (Ta#S13260187) and heat shock protein 90 (Ta#S17888158) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199434.s015">S5 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199434.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

However, most of these studies have focused on analyzing the effects of extreme temperatures that can be sub-physiological or non-physiological, with dramatic consequences in plants. Conversely, the effects of moderate elevation (warming) in a range of physiological temperatures could have less visible phenotype modifications depending on the stage of application, the duration and the intensity of this treatment. In bread wheat, Wan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that an increase in temperature up to 28&#x000b0;C accelerated grain development during the first 7 days after anthesis. Consequently, the control (19&#x000b0;C) had progressed by the equivalent of 12 days, meanwhile, the treated (27&#x000b0;C) progressed by the equivalent of 17 days, giving a net acceleration of about 5 days under these conditions.</p><p>In this work, warming reduced the TKW and the dry mass of individual grains by respectively 13.7% and 14.4%, and this reduction was not due to a decrease of the filling rate. We found that the maximum filling rate (2.74 vs 2.68 mg dry matter per daa) is not affected by temperature. In contrast, the filling duration was significantly reduced from 30 days at 19&#x000b0;C to only 25 days to reach 95% of the maximum nutrients accumulation at 27&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Although the stage and the duration of application of a high temperature are not identical, this result coincides with the observations of Wan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in wheat, as well as with those of Boden <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>. Similarly, our results are consistent with those found by Ferris <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who showed that 10&#x000b0;C above ambient temperature negatively affected all the agronomic traits measured in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Effect of warming on the expression of the genes in wheat grain</title><p>Globally, the high temperature treatment applied in our experiment (19&#x000b0;C vs 27&#x000b0;C) seems to induce few extreme variations in the expression of genes during wheat grain development. Indeed, the absolute number of differentially expressed genes linked to temperature is relatively low compared to the number of genes linked to development.</p><p>As a matter of fact, a few genes exhibited a high expression variation (Fold Change &#x02265; 2) upon warming. However, it is worthy to note that those genes are different from the genes generally over-expressed under "severe heat stress" conditions commonly reported in the literature. In particular, significant induction of HSP genes and HSF transcription factors is a hallmark of a response to a severe heat stress. For instance, when seeds of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>) were subjected to a temperature of 35&#x000b0;C for five hours, several heat stress marker genes were strongly induced. This set included 13 HSFs and 91 HSPs, which were strikingly up-regulated by an average of 36.5-fold [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Indeed, in our study, 26 genes were annotated as "Heat stress genes" such as HSP70 or HSP90 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199434.s012">S2 Table</xref>), however, only one gene (Ta#S3268284) coding for a "23.2 kDa heat shock protein-like" was found up-regulated with a log2FC = 2.1 in stage 240&#x000b0;Cd. A similar observation was reported in wheat by Wan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], who even found that a gene coding for an HSP70 was down-regulated by warming.</p><p>Therefore, it is arguable that the low intensity of the "stress" applied in our study induces only a moderate reaction as observed in Arabidopsis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although heat stress was not directly addressed in their study, Claeys <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] analyzed several other abiotic stresses and found that plant growth and gene expression responses to stress are highly dose-responsive, suggesting the existence of a very sensitive machinery which is fine-tuning the molecular responses in accordance with the stress level.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Co-expression analysis and the identification of trait-related modules</title><p>WGCNA is one of the numerous methods used for the inference of gene networks from transcriptomic data [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, this approach could be used to uncover correlations between quantitative traits and the expression profiles of genes. In this study, a set of differentially expressed genes between low and high temperature assays were identified and retained for the construction of the co-expression gene networks. As several agronomic traits were measured in the two experiments, two networks have been independently inferred in both assays, yielding 32 and 30 modules in LT and HT respectively. A significant correlation of agronomic traits was found between several modules. In particular, 2 modules (turquoise modules) were found correlated to cell numbers in the endosperm and grain length in both temperature treatments. Annotation of the genes within these modules showed a significant gene enrichment (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test) in nutrient reservoir activity. In addition, they are of similar size (687 and 670 genes respectively) among which, 440 are common, indicating a high degree of conservation. Thus, the two modules are deemed functionally equivalent. The significant effect of the high temperature on the mean expression of the genes in these modules is an acceleration at the 120&#x000b0;Cd stage, a plateau is attained at this stage in the high temperature assay, while such a plateau is reached with a significant delay at 160&#x000b0;Cd in the low temperature assay.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate, that i) a set of genes involved in nutrient reservoir activity (in particular seed storage proteins and to a lesser extent sugar metabolism) is significantly associated with yield components in wheat grains (cell numbers), and ii) expression of genes involved in nutrient reservoir activity is hastened by a moderate high temperature. These results also suggest that the early acceleration of starch and seed storage proteins accumulation may somehow reduce the cell division duration, leading to the reduction of the final seed size. Our results are consistent with the finding of Sekhon <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] who developed two divergent maize populations, differing in seed weight and seed size by magnitudes of 4.7-fold and 2.6-fold respectively. Phenotypic comparison of these populations indicated a significant reduction of the duration of the filling-phase in the small seed population. They also identified a critical stage (12 days after pollination DAP) where a substantial change in the expression of key genes involved in starch and seed storage protein synthesis was observed. For example, the major genes involved in starch biosynthesis such as sucrose synthase, a large subunit of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and starch branching enzyme1, had higher levels of expression in the endosperm of small seed inbreds at 12 DAP relative to large seed inbreds. Similarly, the genes encoding maize seed storage proteins (zein proteins) also had higher expression in small seed inbreds at 12 DAP. The authors suggested that carbohydrate status appears to be a key factor determining seed size by controlling the time of initiation and the rate and duration of endosperm cell division. In contrast, when barley caryopses were subjected to severe heat stress (42&#x000b0;C for up to six hours), Mangelsen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] observed a down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and starch synthesis leading to a net reduction in yield. One hypothesis explaining a significant correlation between the expression of genes involved in nutrient reservoir activity (sugar and seed storage proteins) and at least one yield component (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. cell numbers) is that the sugar and nitrogen act not only as nutrients but also as signals triggering adaptive developmental responses. In particular, emerging data indicate that sugar-derived signaling systems, including trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), sucrose non-fermenting related kinase1 (SnRK), and the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase complex play important roles in regulating plant development by modulating nutrient and energy signaling especially under abiotic stresses where sugar availability is low [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It has also been suggested that cell division could be inhibited due to a decreased glucose level under stress conditions leading to fruit and seed abortion at harvest [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Interestingly, nitrate and amino acids also activate TOR kinase by unknown mechanisms in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="pone.0199434.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] suggesting that the plant TOR signaling network may also sense the nitrate and amino-acids status to control plant growth. Hence, in an attempt to depict a link between grain development, nitrogen/soluble sugar status and warming, a hypothetical model could be proposed in wheat. Under optimal temperatures, there is a balance between the growth of the different grain compartments and the accumulation of starch and storage proteins. Upon warming, there is a premature onset of transcription of genes related to starch and seed storage proteins biosynthesis. The early accumulation of storage compounds may divert the nitrogen and carbon resources towards nutrients accumulation, thus creating an imbalance in the partitioning of these resources at the expense of growth. In addition, the nitrogen and soluble sugar status may act as a signal to restrict cell divisions in the endosperm. The duration of the cell division phase is then shortened, eventually leading to smaller grains.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199434.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Temperature treatment (panel A) and the timing (panel B) of their application according to grain development.</title><p>Two temperature treatments were applied; mean day temperature: 19&#x000b0;C for low temperature condition (LT) vs 27&#x000b0;C for high temperature conditions (HT).
