Moreover, a body-weight matched experiment revealed that teff improved glucose tolerance in a manner independent of body weight reduction after 6 weeks of dietary treatment. Enhanced beige adipocyte formation without improved adipose inflammation in a body-weight matched experiment suggests that the improved glucose metabolism was a consequence of beige adipocyte formation, but not solely through adipose inflammation. However, these differences between teff- and wheat-containing diets were not observed in the high-fat diet group.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Teff improved glucose tolerance likely by promoting beige adipocyte formation and improved adipose inflammation.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim (Japan)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maegawa</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004948</institution-id><institution>Astellas Pharma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maegawa</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Department of Medicine at SUMS received research promotion grants [SHOGAKUKIFU] from Boehringer Ingelheim, and Astellas to HM.

It is also grown in India, Europe, Australia and the United States of America [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and has become popular because it is gluten-free [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Teff is one of the world&#x02019;s smallest grains and is difficult to refine, making its flour rich in fiber from the bran and germ [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Its name is derived from the Amharic term &#x0201c;tefa&#x0201d;, meaning &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d;, because of its tiny size. It is estimated that 20%&#x02013;40% of the carbohydrates in teff are resistant starches [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recently, studies have shown that dietary fiber plays a role in lowering inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Dietary fiber also reduces body weight by acting on satiety mechanisms and post-prandial glycemia by inhibiting absorption [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, diets rich in whole grains and resistant starches improve insulin responsiveness and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with diets based on refined grains [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Adipose tissue inflammation is a metabolic disorder implicated in the development of insulin resistance mediated by macrophage recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines released from adipose tissue consequently contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adipose tissue inflammation is characterized by the increased presence of crown-like structures and upregulation of proinflammatory genes such as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (<italic>TNF&#x003b1;</italic>) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (<italic>Mcp1</italic>; <italic>CCL2</italic>), and the macrophage marker, <italic>F4/80</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are products of the microbiota in the intestine. Resistant starches and dietary fibers are the main substrates of microbiota that produce SCFAs [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Notably, acetate is the most dominant product in the intestine and attenuates chronic inflammation through activation of regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Increasing evidence shows that SCFAs are potential targets for preventing or counteracting obesity and its associated disorders, such as dysregulated glucose metabolism and insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although teff has become a familiar health food because of its gluten-free characteristic, its effect on glucose metabolism remains completely unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of teff on glucose metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Animals and dietary groups</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice were housed with a 12-h light&#x02013;dark cycle at 24&#x000b0;C.

This is consistent with previous observations in epidemiological studies that high dietary fiber consumption is associated with a lower BMI [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The World Health Organization has reported that only 2.5% of Ethiopian males and 4.5% of Ethiopian females have a BMI &#x0003e;25 [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the rate is increasing, the current prevalence of diabetes in Ethiopia is only 3.8% [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Injera is a staple food made with teff that may be associated with the maintenance of BMI in Ethiopian people. Notably, immigrants from Ethiopia to Israel exhibited an increased BMI and increased incidence of diabetes, potentially because of changes in food selections [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the current study, the CD-teff diet maintained body weight gain without changes in food intake compared with the CD-wheat diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results suggest that this may be explained by enhanced formation of beige adipocytes in the CD-teff group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g006">Fig 6A and 6C&#x02013;6F</xref>). To explorer the mechanism, we focused on the metabolite of dietary fiber, SCFAs. Our results showed that CD-teff has a remarkable potential to generate SCFAs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g005">Fig 5C&#x02013;5F</xref>), similar to the previous study which whole grain diets increase cecal SCFAs in rats [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This is further supported by increases in the villi heights in CD-teff diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref>). The villi heights is increased by direct infusion of SCFAs into cecum [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201661.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which is recognized as a gold standard to monitor intestinal health in animals [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201661.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Previous study reported that SCFAs stimulated the formation of beige adipocytes through GPR43/41 signaling [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201661.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, direct incubation of acetate in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and infusion of acetate in KK-Ay mice clearly showed increased Ucp-1 expression which is the central, hallmark of beige adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201661.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Decreased body weight in CD-teff may be a consequence of increased SCFAs through beige adipocytes formation.</p><p>The teff-containing diet improved glucose tolerance in the control diet but not in the HFD. Because this effect was observed during the IPGTT, this phenomenon is not a direct effect of fiber, such as delaying glucose absorption [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Rather, body weight reduction may indirectly influence glucose metabolism improved by teff. We speculated that this may be explained in part by body weight differences in the wheat and teff groups. However, the pair feeding experiment showed that body weight reduction by teff is not the sole cause of improved glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Another possible mechanism is adipose inflammation. The CD-teff group showed a dramatic reduction in adipose inflammation markers compared with the CD-wheat group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g003">Fig 3A&#x02013;3C</xref>). The lack of differences in adipose inflammation between the HFD-wheat and HFD-teff groups support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g004">Fig 4A&#x02013;4C</xref>). This finding is consistent with a previous study in which greater consumption of dietary fiber was associated with lower visceral adiposity and multiple biomarkers implicated in inflammation in adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. GPR41 and GPR43 are receptors for SCFAs and a recent report has revealed the effect of this pathway by showing that adipose specific GPR43 transgenic mice had reduced numbers of F4/80-positive cells in the adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the role of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) was highlighted in inflammatory diseases [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Acetate derived from dietary fiber has been reported to upregulate Treg via the action of SCFAs through a GPR43-dependent mechanism or histone deacetylase inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In our study, we hypothesized that there would be increased expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor associated with Tregs, in the adipose tissue, however our data showed decreased Foxp3 expression in the CD-teff group, suggesting acetate had a minor role in inducing Tregs in the adipose tissue.</p><p>Teff reduced the postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations both in CD and HFD fed mice examined by the OMTT (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g001">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g002">2E</xref>). This suggests that each glucose excursion during dietary intervention may be lower in the CD-teff and HFD-teff groups compared with the CD-wheat and HFD-wheat groups, respectively.</p><p>Dietary fiber has been reported to attenuate weight gain, and enhance insulin sensitivity and GLP-1 secretion [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given that teff is consumed as a whole grain, its richness in resistant starches and fiber could elicit similar effects, such as reduced glucose absorption [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which is shown by better glucose tolerance during weight matching conditions by CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In our study, we also found that the active GLP-1 concentration was higher in the CD-teff group compared with the CD-wheat group, but not in the HFDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201661.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This may also be explained by the cecal SCFAs levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201661.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p><p>The strengths of this study are two-fold. First, to the best of knowledge, this is the first report of the beneficial effects of teff on glucose metabolism and body weight <italic>in vivo</italic>. Second, this study found a mechanism underlying this phenomenon via adipose inflammation and / or beige adipocyte formation. However, there are some limitations to the study. First, the differences in ingredients between teff and wheat are not solely related to dietary fiber. Although wheat and teff are almost isocaloric (<xref rid="pone.0201661.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), higher fat and protein contents may influence its effects. A previous report has shown that the levels of iron, calcium, and copper are higher in teff [<xref rid="pone.0201661.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our study, teff contained about 10 times higher iron and calcium compared with wheat (<xref rid="pone.0201661.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The plasma iron and calcium concentrations were similar in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201661.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) probably because these nutrients are tightly regulated independently of dietary intake. Second, teff has several subtypes. We chose ivory teff for this study because it is one of the most common types in the markets. Differences in type may result in variation in the effects on glucose metabolism. Third, teff is regularly consumed as injera. The cooking process of injera involves several steps, including fermentation. Therefore, any generalizations must be made with caution. Fourth, beige adipocyte markers changed heterogeneously. Increased Ucp-1 expression in CD-teff mice may not be induced through &#x003b2;3-adrenergic pathway which is a major modulator of cold induced beige adipocyte formation.</p><p>In conclusion, teff improved glucose tolerance through beige adipocytes formation accompanied with improved adipose inflammation potentially by short chain fatty acids derived from dietary fiber. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms including microbiota and usefulness in clinical situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201661.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Active GLP-1 concentration in mice fed with CD-wheat, CD = teff, HFD-wheat, and HFD-teff for 14 weeks.</title><p>Sample were collected under deep anesthesia after 15 hours of fasting. *p &#x0003c; 0.05, n = 4&#x02013;5 in each groups.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201661.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201661.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Plasma concentration of Ca.</title><p><bold>IP and Fe in mice fed with CD-wheat, CD-teff, HFD-wheat, and HFD-teff for 9 weeks.</bold> Sample were collected under deep anesthesia after 15 hours of fasting or fed state. *p &#x0003c; 0.05, n = 4 in each groups.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201661.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201661.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>A: mRNA levels of thermogenic and beige adipocyte marker genes in the inguinal adipose tissue from mice fed for 14 weeks with HFD-what or HFD-teff.</bold> All mRNA expression data were normalized to 36B4.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201661.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Million Mulugeta (Division of Digestive Diseases, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine) for helpful advice.
