This approach is particularly important when analysing meiotic cell division where morphogenesis of individual proteins follows stage-specific changes and is accompanied by a noticeable chromatin dynamism. The method presented here is simple and provides reliable results of high quality signal, low background staining and can be completed within 2 days following preparation. Conventional widefield epifluorescent or laser scanning microscopy can be used for high resolution and three-dimensional analysis. Fixation and preparation techniques were optimised to best preserve nuclear morphology and protein epitopes without the need for any antigen retrieval. Preparation of plant material involved short cross-linking fixation of meiotic tissues with paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by enzyme digestion and slide-mounting. In order to avoid rapid sample degradation typical of shortly fixed plant materials, and to be able to perform IL later, slides were snap-frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Ultra-freezing produced a remarkable degree of structural preservation for up to 12 months, whereby sample quality was similar to that of fresh material. Harsh chemicals and sample dehydration were avoided throughout the procedure and permeability was ensured by a 0.1&#x02013;0.3% detergent treatment. The ImmunoFISH method was developed specifically for studying meiosis in <italic>Triticeae</italic>, but should also be applicable to other grass and plant species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>cytology</kwd><kwd>chromatin dynamics</kwd><kwd>immunolabelling</kwd><kwd>ImmunoFISH</kwd><kwd>chromatin morphology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Seventh Framework Programme<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100011102</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">625835</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Hungarian Science Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100010024</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">124266</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Magyar Tudom&#x000e1;nyos Akad&#x000e9;mia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003825</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">GENPROF IF 18/2012</award-id><award-id rid="cn003">KEP-5/2017</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome&#x02013;chromosome interactions leading to homologous pairing at meiosis are accompanied by programmed changes in chromatin organisation and structure. Distinct stages of chromatin remodelling and movement with association of landmark chromosomal regions imprint the period of early meiosis and result in a distinctive nuclear polarisation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Colas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Heslop-Harrison and Schwarzacher, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sepsi et al., 2017</xref>). These chromatin dynamics are facilitated by meiosis-specific functional protein complexes, whose presence and localisation at particular chromosomal regions reflect the progression through meiosis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzacher, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cahoon and Hawley, 2016</xref>). To understand regulation and interdependence of these complex events, and to evaluate possible effects on plant fertility, the morphogenesis of specific proteins needs to be visualised in the context of chromatin organisation and movement.</p><p>Isolation of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genes involved in synapsis, recombination and meiotic chromatin movement and the production of polyclonal antibodies against meiotic proteins led to a more accurate deciphering of the meiotic processes in higher plants (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Osman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Pradillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Naranjo, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Varas et al., 2015</xref>). Methods are available to track meiotic proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chelysheva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2014</xref>) but optimal tissue preservation and achievement of high-quality immunosignal in grasses with their large chromosomes (30&#x02013;100 times the size of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Choulet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Heslop-Harrison and Schwarzacher, 2011</xref>) requires modifications of fixation, preparation and labelling techniques.</p><p>Analysis of meiosis of crop plants such as the <italic>Triticeae</italic>, where the crop is the seed, is particularly important as any meiotic aberrations directly affect fertility and grain yield and thus have major economic impacts. Cytogenetic techniques including conventional staining, chromosome banding and fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) had been used earlier to study meiosis in bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, 2n = 6x = 42) and provided valuable knowledge on the pairing of the hexaploid chromosome set. However, a precise timing of chromosome behaviour at early meiosis could not be determined using these techniques alone. Cytological and anatomical criteria (chromatin morphology, anther length and position of the floret within the ear) are only indicative for differentiating stages of prophase I (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Arag&#x000f3;n-Alcaide et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzacher, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Maestra et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, whilst electron microscopy can detect lateral and central elements of the synaptonemal complex providing an accurate sequence of chromosome synapsis &#x02013; thus accurately defining the meiotic sub-stages &#x02013; the complex preparation reveals only the SC and it is not possible to identify the individual chromosomes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Holm, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Holm, 1988</xref>).</p><p>ImmunoFISH combines FISH to label chromosomes and chromosome regions with immunohistochemistry and high-resolution microscopy, to study chromatin dynamics and specific meiotic proteins simultaneously, providing a precise timing of prophase I (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sepsi et al., 2017</xref>). The protocol presented here was developed for the analysis of meiotic cells of <italic>Triticeae</italic> and focused on the three-dimensional (3D) preservation of nuclei and long-term storage without the need for time-consuming embedding and tissue sectioning. Our protocol, is an all in one method and does not need relocating photographed nuclei with the first procedure [e.g., immunolabelling (IL)] after the second procedure (e.g., FISH) as reported by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n et al. (2017)</xref>. It addresses challenges presented when nuclear proteins, often difficult to preserve and requiring careful balanced conditions during IL, are to be detected at the same time as specific DNA sequences using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation that require different procedures to open up chromatin to allow penetration of the probe.</p><p>Here, we also give details of growing plants in growth cabinets to provide plentiful developmentally homogenous material with healthy ears undergoing meiosis. We followed the chromosome axis component ASY1 and the SC transverse filament protein ZYP1 with respect to active centromeres (CENH3 labelling) and telomeric repeat sequences (TRS-FISH) within male meiotic nuclei of hexaploid wheat (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Houben and Schubert, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Higgins et al., 2005</xref>) the procedure has been proven on barley and wheat&#x02013;barley hybrid lines when studying alien centromere activity and chromosome elimination at meiosis. Our method will also be applicable to other <italic>Triticeae</italic> and grass species and to generic FISH protocols (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzacher and Heslop-Harrison, 2000</xref>) that we developed in wheat relevant to all plant species with little modification.</p><p>The presented fixation and IL method can be used alone to detect proteins. However when combining IL with FISH (ImmunoFISH) it is challenging to balance fixation and permeabilisation treatments to preserve protein antigenicity and 3D nuclear architecture while ensuring cell permeability. We used a non-denaturing fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, PFA), which preserved chromatin and nuclear proteins but hindered penetration of antibodies and labelled FISH probes. Permeabilisation steps were subsequently adjusted by testing several treatments. One of the major limitations of non-denaturing fixation of plant tissues is that samples need to be subject to IL promptly (a few days after fixation) otherwise nuclear integrity would be compromised. Meiotic experiments in wheat as well as other plants, involve processing of a large amount of flowers, spikes, spikelets, and anthers within a short period of time (generally 1&#x02013;2 weeks for a set of plants), quickly resulting in a large number of preparations and the need to proceed to IL limits the number of plants that can be analysed. We therefore focused on methods for the long-term storage of meiotic preparations prior to the ImmunoFISH procedure in order to facilitate work planning and to increase the number of plants processed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials</title><p>Seeds of spring wheat cv. &#x0201c;Chinese Spring&#x0201d; were sown in Jiffy pellet pots and grown at room temperature (RT) for 10 days or until they were 10 cm high. Plants were replanted in soil in 20 cm diameter pots and transferred to a greenhouse or growth cabinet and maintained at 20&#x000b0;C (&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C) with 12 h light/day. Winter cultivars that require a period of cold treatment (vernalisation) in order to avoid a delay in ear initiation, were transferred to a vernalisation cabinet ahead of potting up and kept at 4&#x000b0;C with 12 h light/day for 6 weeks. Shorter days (8 h) with slightly higher temperatures (up to 8&#x000b0;C) can also be used.</p><p>Potted plants should be ideally grown in growth cabinets where environmental conditions (temperature, day length, humidity, light intensity) can be adjusted to their specific needs. Alternatively, plants can be grown in a glasshouse or outdoors during spring exploiting the natural increase in day length and temperature, but time interval to flowering will not be as predicable using these methods due to changing weather patterns. A standard cabinet program for wheat consists of 15&#x000b0;C day/10&#x000b0;C night (12 h/day) for an initial 4 weeks period. Day length and temperature should then be increased by 2 h and 2&#x000b0;C, respectively, every 3 weeks until the day-temperature reaches 19&#x000b0;C and the day length 16 h/day. For faster growing wheat varieties and other cereals these time intervals might need to be adjusted as reaching 19&#x000b0;C before meiosis is important for full fertility. Depending on the variety, wheat enters meiosis &#x0223c;8&#x02013;10 weeks after vernalisation. Compared to wheat, barley genotypes reach meiosis earlier, while rye usually enters meiosis 1&#x02013;2 weeks later.</p></sec><sec><title>ImmunoFISH Experimental Procedures</title><p>For the following experimental procedures, different reagents and conditions were tested (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref></bold>), but only those yielding the best results are given here.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of Meiotic Tissue and Fixation</title><p>Meiotic division follows a circadian cycle, and meiocytes are arrested in early meiotic prophase during the night; in order to have stages around or in meiotic metaphase, spikes need to be collected in the morning &#x0223c;3 h after the light comes on.

Spikelets of hexaploid wheats carry at least three fertile florets (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>), however, only the first two florets are used in most studies, since they are the best developed and most uniform. The most developed spikelets are located in the middle of the ear while spikelets towards the top and the base carry florets at successively earlier stages with the top and bottom spikelet, respectively, being the earliest. Anthers of the same floret carry meiocytes in the same developmental stage (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennett, 1971</xref>). Starting with the spikelet positioned at the middle of the ear, one anther was excised from the first two florets (termed as floret A and B) and squashed in 45% (v/v) acetic acid to determine the approximate meiotic stage. Anther lengths were also carefully noted down for future reference. The two remaining anthers of each floret were placed into a 14-mm cell culture insert (8 &#x003bc;m membrane pore size, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States, No. 140656) in a 12-well tissue culture plate containing ice-cold 4% PFA.</p><p>Isotonic microfiltered PFA (Agar Scientific, Stansted, United Kingdom; No. R1026, 16%) was diluted to 4% in 1&#x000d7; PBS (phosphate buffered saline, 137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.76 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). 4% PFA can alternatively be freshly prepared by dissolving PFA powder (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany, No. P6148) in 1&#x000d7; PBS by heating to 75&#x02013;80&#x000b0;C while stirring. A 48-&#x003bc;M NaOH/100 ml of fluid should be added (e.g., 6 &#x003bc;l of 8 M NaOH/100 ml) after which the mix will immediately clear. To avoid thermal decomposition, care should be taken not to overheat the solution. Sampling continued towards the bottom of the ear and anthers were consequently checked and fixed from the first two florets of each spikelet. In order to allow the penetration of PFA into the inner layers of the tissues, anthers were fixed for 1 h while kept on ice. Washing consisted of two times 5 min at RT in 1&#x000d7; PBS by keeping the anthers in the inserts and exchanging the fluids with a fine tip Pasteur pipette. Fixed and washed anthers were kept in a final change of fresh 1&#x000d7; PBS in the inserts of the plate that was covered with a lid and placed on ice into an icebox and left at 4&#x000b0;C overnight (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Cartoon showing the main steps of tissue fixation maceration and slide mounting of meiotic nuclei preparation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01193-g002"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Preparation of Cell Nuclei for ImmunoFISH</title><p>1&#x000d7; PBS washing buffer was removed carefully and replaced by 300 &#x003bc;l of enzyme solution prepared according to <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Houben and Schubert (2003)</xref>.

Five minutes of vacuum infiltration was used to facilitate enzyme penetration. Samples were subsequently incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for an additional 5 min. Anthers were kept on ice and subsequent sample preparation was made to judge the extent of digestion. Incubation with the enzyme mix could be extended for a further 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C if needed. The enzyme solution was then immediately taken off and replaced with ice-cold 1&#x000d7; PBS (two times for 5 min).</p><p>Preparations were made promptly after the enzyme treatment on Superfrost Plus Adhesion slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cells fixed with PFA have a superior cellular architecture and proteins are preserved in their 3D relationships within the nucleus (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kiernan, 2000</xref>). However, in order to access nuclear structures during IL and FISH, only a very short PFA fixation (1&#x02013;2 h) at 4&#x000b0;C with immediate transfer to buffer can be undertaken (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref></bold>) and therefore keeping those fixed plant tissues at RT or 4&#x000b0;C would shortly lead to sample degradation and quality loss. Similarly, keeping ready prepared slides at RT also showed sample degradation.</p><p>In order to store slides and plan experiments with large number of samples, we investigated the effect of deep-freezing on the preservation of preparations.

However, when combined with FISH one needs to balance fixation and permeabilisation treatments in order to preserve protein antigenicity and 3D nuclear architecture, whilst ensuring cell permeability. We used a non-denaturing fixative (4% PFA), which preserved chromatin and nuclear proteins but hindered penetration of antibodies and labelled FISH probes. We tested several concentrations and combinations of permeabilisation agents (cold methanol, Proteinase-K, RNase, Tween-20, Triton-X-100, CHAPS-hydrate, repeated freeze-thaw cycles; see <bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref></bold>) for various times prior to ImmunoFISH to achieve an optimal accessibility of DNA and proteins whilst maintaining nuclear structure. The best results were obtained with a low concentration of Triton-X-100 and CHAPS hydrate-solution (0.1 and 0.3%, respectively, in 1&#x000d7; PBS) followed by a short pepsin digestion and a quick PFA post-fixation step applied before FISH (<bold>Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref></bold>). NICK-Translation <italic>in situ</italic> probe labelling was chosen in order to control probe-length (the longer the Nick-translation procedure the shorter the probe) and thus further facilitate penetration, but assume that short directly labelled oligonucleotides or those labelled with random priming will also be suitable.</p></sec><sec><title>Precise Protein Immunolocalisation During Meiosis</title><p>Following adequate fixation and permeabilisation treatments we obtained well-preserved meiotic nuclei and were able to label the following nuclear structures with IL: CENH3 protein (showing active centromeres) together with SC axial and central element proteins ASY and ZYP1. Subsequently, in separate experiments we performed ImmunoFISH to show telomeres and centromeres concurrently with SC central elements (ZYP1): telomeres were visualised by FISH (TRS-FISH) while centromeres and the ZYP1 proteins were stained by IL. The bulk chromatin was labelled by DAPI in both cases. This enabled us to correlate centromere&#x02013;telomere dynamics and that of the bulk chromatin to the development of the synaptonemal complex (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sepsi et al., 2017</xref>; <bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>).</p><p>Samples were scanned by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and 2D images were collected every 200 nm in depth (<italic>Z</italic>-direction) from each channel resulting in <italic>z</italic> stack series covering the whole 3D volume of the nucleus (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A&#x02013;D</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B,F,G</xref></bold>).

Leptotene nuclei, defined by the formation of major polarised centromere associations and the linearisation of axial elements along chromosomes, showed in addition to our previous results (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sepsi et al., 2017</xref>) a notable nuclear compaction (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>).

During zygotene, when synapsis elongates in two stages (first from the telomeres and second from the chromosome arms), nuclei became enlarged and parallel alignments between the unsynapsed axes measured 300&#x02013;500 nm, exceeding axis distances observed at leptotene (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>).

Previous methods providing visualisation of high quality 3D nuclear structures in plants required laborious tissue fixation, embedding and sectioning (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Holm, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Bass, 2012</xref>) and have limited possibilities for the identification of specific proteins and DNA sequences. Sectioning of the material after short fixation using a vibratome can take several days despite the need for processing plant material promptly following a brief fixation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aragon-Alcaide et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Prieto et al., 2007</xref>) risking the degradation of material. Our technique produces a single layer of well-preserved, cytoplasm-free nuclei embedded in antifade, an ideal situation for high resolution imaging with CLSM. Good resolution using CLSM on thick sections is only possible within the upper 15&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m of the preparations because of the light scattering effect of the cytoplasm and the cell walls, reducing the efficiency of both fluorochrome excitation and emitted signal detection. Although point spread function of the imaging system can be corrected using a deconvolution software, signal-reducing effect of the thick tissue surrounding the nuclei results in lower quality compared to the single-layer preparations. Our method does not depend upon specialised sectioning equipment and can be completed within two working days following slide preparation. Moreover, meiotic preparations can be stored for several months in an ultra-freezer without any effect on nuclear morphology, allowing a better project planning and processing of a significantly higher number of plants.</p><p>ImmunoFISH was used earlier to follow chromatin dynamism during SC formation in hexaploid wheat and revealed that major centromere associations followed by the formation of the telomere bouquet create a highly polarised nuclear environment that immediately precedes synapsis initiation from the telomeres. We showed that centromere dynamics (notably depolarisation and scattering of centromere clusters) correlates with a second wave of SC elongation from multiple nucleation sites within the euchromatic chromosome arms (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sepsi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we were able to increase the resolution of our analysis, and to measure axis distances through meiotic prophase I and showed alignments of 200&#x02013;300 nm at leptotene. In contrast, parallel configurations of unsynapsed regions at mid-zygotene spanned 300&#x02013;500 nm indicating that the tight chromatin arrangement observed in early meiosis is relaxed upon SC initiation. Presynaptic alignments of 400 nm typical of leptotene nuclei are known to be mediated by recombination initiation through the interactions of homologous duplexes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Henderson and Keeney, 2005</xref>). A detailed investigation in the filamentous fungus <italic>Sordaria macrospora</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Storlazzi et al., 2010</xref>) indicated that homologous juxtapositions at leptotene are promoted by proteins of the recombination machinery (Mer3, Msh4, and Mlh1) with Msh4 identified as the first factor specifically determining presynaptic inter-axis distances. Thus, specific recombination complex proteins support homologous pairing well before their action in the recombination process. Double strand break (DSB)-mediated homologue interactions also define spatial patterns of SC nucleation sites, a subset of which carry embedded crossover interactions (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Larger axis distances as we showed at mid-zygotene, when a great proportion of the chromosome arms were synapsed, are most likely indicative of synapsis elongating from earlier nucleation sites rather than new SC initiation sites.</p><p>Protein morphogenesis can reflect initiation and progression of recombination, strategy of synapsis construction in wild and mutant backgrounds and thus is a major indicator of the fate of meiosis. Alteration in chromatin organisation and dynamics are essential to generate chromosome&#x02013;chromosome interactions during the critical period of homologue recognition and pairing, so the timing and fidelity of synapsis and recombination relies on these processes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sz&#x000e9;kv&#x000f6;lgyi et al., 2015</xref>). Meiosis is influenced by environmental factors so it is increasingly relevant to reveal meiotic progression under stress conditions in crops and highlight the variable exposures influencing recombination, fertility and ultimately yield (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Modliszewski and Copenhaver, 2017</xref>). To understand the control and interdependence of key meiotic events in higher plants it is critical to simultaneously study DNA processes and chromatin organisation. Our method has allowed us to analyse chromatin dynamics at meiosis with high resolution and will be applicable to plant species in general to gain insight into this critical stage of plant reproduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Availability</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>TS, JH-H, and AS conceived and designed the project.
