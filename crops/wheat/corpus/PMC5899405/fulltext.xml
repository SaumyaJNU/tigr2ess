This size makes whole genome resequencing costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, a number of reduced representation sequencing approaches exist that make re-sequencing cost effective. These include approaches such as: Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing or RAD-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], involving digesting DNA with restriction enzymes and sequencing a tag for each resulting fragment; transcriptome sequencing, where we sequence cDNA generated from mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; sequence capture, the capture and sequencing of DNA fragments by the hybridization of genomic DNA with synthesized probes. With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available, it is possible to design capture probe sets for tiling evenly across the genome and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs and CNVs to the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation also provides a source of natural variability contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype. The most common form of DNA methylation is 5-methylcytosine, an epigenetic mark found throughout the genome of most eukaryotic organisms. Cytosine methylation has been implicated with orchestrating the structure and function of the genome, regulating chromatin and gene expression and it is found in plants in the context of CG, CHG and CHH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is thought that cytosine methylation may be important for plants, providing a mechanism for rapidly adapting to environmental change.</p><p id="Par9">Bisulphite treatment deaminates unmethylated cytosines resulting in conversion from a cytosine to a uracil residue. Therefore, bisulphite treatment in combination with sequencing can identify methylated cytosine residues, an approach termed methyl-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previously, we used methyl-seq in combination with sequence capture to survey the epigenome in hexaploid bread wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An important question now is to understand how methylation varies across a globally diverse collection of wheat germplasm adapted to specific local agricultural niches. However, to apply methyl-seq to this kind of dataset you ideally require both DNA sequence data and bisulphite treated sequence data for each wheat accession otherwise C-T SNPS will be incorrectly classified as unmethylated cytosine sites.</p><p id="Par10">Here, we describe a new wheat capture probe set that is tiled across the hexaploid bread wheat genome. We present a method, based on Agilent SureSelect Methyl-Seq, that will use a single capture assay as a starting point that is sequentially split and used for both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. We validate the approach by comparing it to standard SureSelect and Methyl-seq sequencing datasets. We benchmark the approach with the reference accession Chinese Spring and demonstrate its utility with an accession from the Watkins collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Our methodology has no detrimental effect on capture efficiency</title><p id="Par11">Using our custom probe set, we initially follow a SureSelect Methyl-Seq library preparation and hybridisation protocol, however we divide the sample immediately after capture and, using two parallel custom protocols, we can take one aliquot through Illumina paired-end sequencing and the second aliquot through bisulphite conversion and Illumina paired-end sequencing (see <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). In order to assess the quality of the sequencing data generated we also performed standard non-divided SureSelect and SureSelect Methyl-Seq enrichments followed by sequencing and compared the output. This splitting after capture &#x0201c;dual-purpose&#x0201d; methodology allows us to directly compare the genotype and epi-type of the same DNA sample.</p><p id="Par12">For the first enrichment, (i) a standard SureSelect library was prepared; this is referred to as non-bisulphite treated full (NBTF).

Moreover, correction of the reference sequence using A/T&#x02794;C/G SNPs could increase the cytosine set for analysis by 1/5th yielding further benefit to analyses.</p><p id="Par24">With a single Agilent SureSelect capture reaction costing in excess of &#x000a3;500 (probe set plus capture reagents based on purchasing a set of 16), by utilising a single capture for both genotype and epigenetic analysis, we can cut these considerable costs. These savings are in addition to the reduction in staff labour costs associated with performing a lower number of capture reactions. Furthermore, there is an additional benefit to performing only one capture reaction to generate genotype and epigenetic information if the DNA quantity that is available for an individual sample is restricted.</p><p id="Par25">Methyl-seq protocols from Agilent&#x02019;s companies such as NimbleGen use an approach where bisulphite conversion is carried out pre-capture. Since bisulphite conversion severely diminishes DNA concentration, this allows users to maximize input into expensive capture reactions by treating as much DNA as possible. However, this necessitates the development of a fully converted and fully non-converted probe for each region of DNA that is more amenable to mammalian systems where methylation has largely been previously profiled and only symmetrical CpG methylation is present typically in so-called highly methylated islands. In many accessions of wheat, and in other plants, the methylation profile is mainly unknown, methylation can exist in both symmetrical and non-symmetrical forms (CpG, CHG and CHH), partial methylation in a region is common and methylation is not always in islands. This makes the design of probes for treatment-pre-capture difficult and incorrectly designed probes could introduce unwanted bias into captures. Here we treat post-capture, this allows the same probes to be used for genotyping and methyl-seq analysis. Our split after capture protocol has been carefully developed to deal with the low DNA concentrations associated with bisulfite treatment post-capture.</p><p id="Par26">When using approaches where bisulphite conversion is carried out pre-capture, software has been developed to allow sample genotyping directly from bisulphite treated sequencing data and although this would reduce costs, removing the need for both DNA sequence and bisulphite treated sequence data, this method depends heavily on having sequence information for both DNA strands in the effort to discriminate C-T SNPs and in plants, has all the previously described problems with conversion-pre-capture. Here, we profile methylation in only one strand of DNA, and as such this requirement for both strands would double the probe capture space and increase sequencing and probe costs. Furthermore, due to the high complexity of genotyping directly from the bisulphite treated sequencing data, such methodologies are highly error prone with reported false positive/false negative SNP calling rates ranging from 15% to upwards of 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We, therefore present a gold standard methodology to ensure highly accurate SNP calls and following on from this high-quality methylation calls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par27">If we wish to accurately profile DNA methylation in diverse wheat lines, then it is advantageous to also generate genotype information. Here, we describe a new capture probe set that is tiled across the hexaploid bread wheat genome and can be effectively utilised to survey genome wide trends in wheat from a genotypic or epigenetic perspective. Furthermore, we present a cost-effective method for performing both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq from a single capture reaction thus significantly reducing reagent costs and DNA requirements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design of the wheat capture probe set</title><p id="Par28">Probes were designed to capture a subset of wheat genes totaling 36&#x000a0;Mb; 12&#x000a0;Mb from each of the three sub-genomes of wheat (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). The design space was a subset of the 110&#x000a0;Mb of assembled wheat genic sequence previously used for a NimbleGen (Roche) exome capture probe set. The 110&#x000a0;Mb was derived from the gene-rich regions of hexaploid bread wheat that had been processed to remove repetitive sequence, remove chloroplast and mitochondrial sequence, collapse redundant sequence and collapse homoeologous genes into one representative sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Initially, 120&#x000a0;bp sequences were tiled across the 110&#x000a0;Mb of genic sequence at 40&#x000a0;bp intervals resulting in 2.3 million potential probe sequences. These probes were then annotated with the following information: (i) % alignment to the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) reference sequence (positional information and gene annotations were also recorded); (ii) number of homoeologous and varietal SNPs (utilising IWGSC, CerealsDB and the wheat ancestral genomes), to allow discrimination between the wheat sub-genomes and to capture diversity, respectively; and (iii) average depth of coverage of the region obtained in previous sequence capture experiments using NimbleGen probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Therefore the order of the capture design contigs along genome B&#x02019;s chromosomal pseudomolecules 1&#x02013;7 was preferentially utilised since the greatest number of contigs could be aligned to these sequences and therefore included (83%).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
