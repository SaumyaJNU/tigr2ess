    "BACKGROUND:Leaf mold, one of the major diseases of tomato caused by Cladosporium fulvum (C. fulvum), can dramatically reduce the yield and cause multimillion dollar losses annually worldwide. Mapping the resistance genes (R genes) of C. fulvum and devising MAS based strategies for breeding new cultivars is an effective approach to improve the resistance in tomato. Up to now, many C. fulvum genes or QTLs have been mapped using different genetic materials, but few studies focused on Cf-10 gene positioning. RESULTS:In this study, we investigated the genetic rules for Cf-10 and used a novel combinatorial strategy to rapidly map the Cf-10 gene. Initially, the performance of F1, F2 and BC1F1 individuals after infection, demonstrated that the resistance against C. fulvum was controlled by a single dominant gene. Two pools of resistant and susceptible individuals from F2 population were investigated, using mapping by sequencing approach and Cf-10 was found to be localized to 3.35 Mb and 3.74 Mb on chromosome 1, employing SNP/InDel index methods, respectively. After accounting for overlapping regions, these two algorithms yielded a total length of 3.29 Mb, narrowing down the target region. We further developed five serviceable KASP markers for this region based on sequencing data and conducted local QTL mapping using individuals from the F2 population, except for mapping by sequencing as mentioned above. Finally Cf-10 gene was mapped spanning a region of 790 kb, where only one gene (Solyc01g007130.3) was annotated as probable receptor protein kinase TMK1 with a LRR motif, a common R gene characteristic. The RT-qPCR analysis further confirmed the localization and the relative expression of Solyc01g007130.3 in Ontario 792 and was found to be significantly higher than that in Moneymaker at 9 dpi and 12 dpi, respectively. CONCLUSION:This study proposed a novel combinatorial strategy by combining SNP-index, InDel-index analyses and local QTL mapping using KASP genotyping approach to rapidly map genes responsible for specific traits and provided a robust base for cloning the Cf-10 gene. Furthermore, these analyses suggest that Solyc01g007130.3 is a potential candidate to be regarded as Cf-10 gene."
