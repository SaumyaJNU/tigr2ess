Understanding these responses is crucial for developing sustainable disease management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, to date, limited information on the spatio-chemical distribution of defense metabolites has been uncovered, due to the limited chemical resolution of classical histochemical staining. Against this background, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging enables (1) the measurement of spatial&#x02013;temporal distributions of disease-related metabolites at tissue and single-cell level, (2) the analysis of a broad variety of molecular classes due to the inherent label-free detection capability of the mass spectrometer, and (3) the combination of these data with microscopic observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While being well established in biomedical science, the technology provides also several areas of application for crop plant pathology and agricultural research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These include development of molecular-genetic approaches for crop disease diagnosis and management, metabolomic phenotyping, design and validation of predictive factors for disease progression and treatment response, and the differentiation between global and local disease effects. Moreover, the direct mapping of metabolites in disease-relevant tissues is a promising approach to specify pathways involved in plant-pathogen interactions. This is especially since quantitative disease resistances, e.g. against <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens, comprise a multitude of pathways and compounds that often have functional diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">To make tissue-based examination available for agricultural research, we have established MS imaging for all major plant organs based on economically important crop plants, including wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous studies on human and plant diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] suggested that histology-guided MS imaging is the most straightforward approach to gain fundamental insights into a plant disease and to aid MS data interpretation&#x02014;in particular if the pathosystem has not or hardly been examined in respect of metabolomics and histopathology. Moreover, integrating molecular and optical image analysis makes it possible to detect areas-of-interest which allows studying metabolism at the host&#x02013;pathogen interface. In this study, we have combined high-resolution atmospheric-pressure scanning microprobe matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-SMALDI) MS imaging with microscopy to study functional, temporal and local aspects of the pathosystem wheat stem-<italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The fungal pathogen is well known to cause the ear disease Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other cereals as well as to produce a large arsenal of cyto- and phytotoxic secondary metabolites. Many of these mycotoxins are also harmful to humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, it was discovered that the fungus has a high ability to infect also wheat roots, leading to substantial reduction of root and seedling development. Moreover, Fusarium root rot (FRR) causes systemic plant colonization and mycotoxin contamination of infected plant parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Together, this represents a major threat for plant fitness, food safety and soil health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The response of wheat to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> has been primarily investigated in ears, while the stem response to systemic colonization is nearly unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The transition from root to shoot is for both the pathogen and the host a critical stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">To gain insights into this disease stage at a molecular level, the wheat response was simultaneous visualized in diseased and healthy stem bases of the cultivar Florence-Aurore. Florence-Aurore has a well-characterized partial seedling resistance to FRR, and is one of the two so far identified resistant genotypes of wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the presented approach we used histological information from stem sections to detected pathogenesis-relevant tissues (areas-of-interest) and to guide assessment and interpretation of molecular data. Excellent agreement was found between optical and molecular image analysis with regard to the disease progression and the detection of disease relevant tissues. The mapping of spatio-temporal metabolic changes demonstrated that FRR induced distinct wheat metabolites in disease relevant tissues (e.g. vascular bundles), indicating that resistance essentially relies on locally and temporally precise &#x0201c;on-demand responses&#x0201d; to pathogen attack. Exclusively for these responses, AP-SMALDI-MS imaging suggested candidate metabolites for a broad wheat resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Moreover, stem infection was accompanied by the release of mycotoxin classes that were hitherto not observed for <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. AP-SMALDI-MS imaging at high-spatial and high-mass resolution proved to a powerful tool for molecular histopathology that can provide plant pathologists with an important understanding of the complex spatio-temporal organization of crop plant resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par18">Fungal colonization of the root&#x02013;shoot junction (referred to as stem base) is a key factor in the success or failure of the FRR disease in wheat. The stem segment at the soil surface was found to function as persistent source of fungal inoculum and gateway for the systemic <italic>F. graminearum</italic> growth into distal stem, leaf and spike tissues. Moreover, the root&#x02013;shoot junction is a crucial part of the nutrient and water flow pathway in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Susceptibility to FRR leads to a rapid colonization of root and stem base, as shown for seedlings of the wheat cultivar Sumai 3 in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b. The high level of tissue colonization and destruction by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> becomes visible as severe necrosis (dark lesions) caused by the necrotrophic feeding on dead host tissues/cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In contrast, the patho-phenotype of the resistant cultivar Florence-Aurore showed, at the same time, significantly lowered disease impacts in terms of seedling growth and necrosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). In particular, the significantly impaired stem base infestation was a key feature of FRR resistance, suggesting the rapid and focused induction of wheat defenses in response to disease spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Differential progression of Fusarium root rot during susceptible and resistant interactions. <bold>a</bold> Root phenotype of the susceptible cultivar Sumai 3 at 14&#x000a0;days after root inoculation (dai) with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in comparison to healthy (control) seedlings.

</p><p id="Par19">The stem base infection by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> represents an almost unknown pathosystem in wheat. Therefore, a histology-guided AP-SMALDI-MS imaging approach was applied by integrating optical and molecular visualization to allow insight into the resistance to disease spread in Florence-Aurore. In this approach, microscopic examination was carried out in the period 5&#x02013;21&#x000a0;days after root inoculation (dai), with the primary aim of identifying areas-of-interest to aid MS imaging analysis. Such areas were defined as spatial and temporal cues with relevance for the <italic>F. graminearum</italic> pathogenesis. Therefore, the microscopic analysis included besides Florence-Aurore also the FRR susceptible cultivar Sumai 3. Transverse sections of the stem base (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d, sampling site) were used for confocal laser scanning/fluorescence microscopy (Sumai 3/Florence-Aurore) and for AP-SMALDI-MS imaging (Florence-Aurore). During the examined period the stem base consists of one or two leaf sheaths, tightly wrapped around an internal stem (Florence-Aurore typically has a single leaf sheath). The anatomical structure of a leaf sheath comprises the abaxial and adaxial epidermis; the vascular bundles that are adjacent to the abaxial epidermis; and the cortical parenchyma (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). The central stem consists of the outer epidermal layer, multiple layers of cortical parenchyma cells of which one layer includes the vascular bundles (hereafter referred to as vascular bundle region), and the central pith (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f).</p><p id="Par20">As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, the stage of stem base infection was histologically characterized by hyphal growth in abaxial epidermal cells and nearby parenchyma cells of leaf sheath. After initial infection, leaf sheaths were extensively colonized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f) as vertical route into the stem, and as horizontal route into the upper shoot. The observations in FRR susceptible Sumai 3 demonstrated a successful colonization of leaf sheath at 10 dai, which was associated with an important change in the fungal strategy. At this point, the vascular bundles were extensively colonized by <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, initially those of the leaf sheaths at 14 dai (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>g) and later those of the stem at 21 dai (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h). Briefly, our previous study on FRR showed that during susceptible interaction fungal hyphae had colonized the entire seedling until the shoot apex at approximately 25 dai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Florence-Aurore seedlings display partial resistance to FRR, which is why the disease spread was significantly lowered, however, not completely prevented. Within the examined period 10&#x02013;21 dai, resistant stem bases were either not or, at the best, sporadically challenged by fungal hyphae (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>i). Based on the histological observations in the susceptible cultivar Sumai 3 the following three timepoints were selected for AP-SMALDI-MS imaging: 10 dai&#x02014;initial infection of leaf sheath, 14 dai&#x02014;colonization of leaf sheath, and 21 dai&#x02014;invasion of inner stem tissues. Leaf sheath epidermis and vascular tissues were disclosed as important sites of wheat-<italic>F. graminearum</italic> interaction. In accordance with the key concept of this study, the visually disclosed areas-of-interest represented crucial stages of the FRR disease with regard to whether or not the pathogen can successfully colonize the stem base, respectively can initiate horizontal growth into distal stem segments.</p><p id="Par21">Due to the partial nature of <italic>Fusarium</italic> resistance, the FRR disease leads to adverse effects on cell membrane integrity and pathogen-induced necrosis also in stem bases of Florence-Aurore. These impacts pose a challenge to tissue sectioning and sample preparation, in addition to the generally high water content and fragile structure of seedling stem bases. The latter results from a relatively low lignin content compared to the later stages of stem elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To obtain thin uniform sections, a coolant mixture of dry ice and hexane was used to implant stem base sections in AP-SMALDI-MS compatible embedding material (carboxy methyl cellulose). Rapid freezing of tissue samples with the coolant mixture was found to be preferable to the usage of dry ice in hexane, due to the relatively high water contents of the stem base. To examine metabolic changes triggered by FRR infection in parallel to the healthy stage, stem base sections of FRR-infected and mock-infected (control) seedlings were arranged on a single glass slide and were simultaneously measured. This allowed a reliable classification of compounds as disease-induced, mock-induced, or constitutively produced (i.e. regardless of treatment). Time-course analysis requires that (transient) changes in the metabolite profile can be distinguished from constitutive and/or constantly produced compounds, such as the phenolic compound delphinidin sophoroside (<italic>m/z</italic> 627.1532) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a&#x02013;c, blue) and the triterpenoid quinquenoside (<italic>m/z</italic> 819.5117) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a&#x02013;c, green). The optical images from stem base sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d&#x02013;f) could be directly correlated to the respective AP-SMALDI-MS images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a&#x02013;c). We combined high mass resolution (which allows generating images with a narrow <italic>m/z</italic> bin width of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;ppm) with high spatial resolution (laser focus 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m without oversampling; sections&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m thick). This allowed for representation of the stem base architecture suitable for a reliable assignment of metabolites to their respective in situ locations, even if damage to diseased stem bases cannot be avoided during sectioning due to the fragile structure.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Comparative AP-SMALDI mass spectrometry imaging of stem base sections obtained from FRR-infected and non-infected wheat seedlings. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> RGB overlay of <italic>m/z</italic> images showing the spatio-temporal distribution of two constitutive wheat metabolites and two pathogen-derived metabolites.

</p><p id="Par23">Taking the identified EN and BEA compounds as markers that indicate a particular disease state, AP-SMALDI-MS imaging predicted for the period 14&#x02013;21 dai a progressive colonization of the leaf sheath, while the stem remains uninfected. This colonization pattern is clearly in line with the observations made by confocal microscopy. Thus, the molecular and the optical analysis support the previously assumed concept of an &#x0201c;epidermis-parenchyma route&#x0201d; that is used by the pathogen to grow from root to stem base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our previous study on root infection could show that vascular system of roots restricts <italic>F. graminearum</italic> colonization, which obviously prevents direct invasion of non-inoculated stem segments via the vascular route. Indeed, the microscopic observation that hyphal invasion of stem base originates at abaxial epidermal and nearby parenchyma cells of leaf sheaths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e) make it very likely that <italic>F. graminearum</italic> spreads via adjacent epidermis and parenchyma cells at the root-shoot junction (shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Considering that partial resistance is mainly characterized by a quantitative limitation of pathogen growth and not by a complete suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], pathogen attempts to invade leaf sheath tissues were phenotypically and microscopically observed to increase between 14 and 21 dai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par24"><italic>F. graminearum</italic> has, so far, not been mentioned as an enniatin or beauvercin producer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this has not been examined for stem or root infections. The <italic>F. graminearum</italic> genome was reported to contain 20 gene clusters coding for unknown metabolites that exhibit a strong gene expression <italic>in planta</italic> during pathogenesis and thus, presumably play a role in enhancing virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The <italic>Fusarium</italic> genes <italic>esyn1</italic> and <italic>kivRFp</italic> encode essential enzymes of EN and BEA biosynthesis, which are applied as markers for the detection of EN/BEA producers <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> homologues of <italic>esyn1</italic> (FGSG_11989) and <italic>kivRFp</italic> (FGSG_02539) were detected by sequence database searching. Both genes are located on chromosome 1 and encode hitherto uncharacterized proteins (details on the BLAST analysis are given in &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). Interestingly, for the deduced <italic>esyn1</italic> gene FGSG_11989 the STRING database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (functional protein association networks) reported interactions, among others, with the polyketide synthase FGSG_02395 (co-occurrence, gene fusion) and the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase FGSG_02394 (co-occurrence, homology). Both enzymes belong to the fungal stress metabolism during pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and are involved in the biosynthesis of ENs and BEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The finding of predicted EN and BEA biosynthesis genes in the genome of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> supports the detection of these mycotoxins by AP-SMALDI-MS imaging. The pathogen is well known to produce the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) to promote pathogenesis of host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. DON was, however, not detected by AP-SMALDI-MS imaging. As was shown in a previous study, the reason could be the low ionization efficiency of trichothecene toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. ENs and BEA may be part of the tissue-specific adaptations made by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to colonize the wheat stem. Whether these toxins are transported to spike tissues, such as the DON toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], remains to be examined. However, studies on the synergistic interaction of co-occurring mycotoxins have demonstrated that mixtures of DON with EN B or BEA are more cytotoxic on mammalian cells than the DON toxin alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. EN B is an emerging harmful toxin with impact on human and animal health as it can cause apoptosis and reduction of cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], while BEA is known to have toxic effects on germinating wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>General metabolic response triggered by FRR in stem base tissues</title><p id="Par25">Due to the label free and multiplexing capabilities of MS imaging it was possible to reveal the temporal and spatial progression of EN analogues and endogenous metabolites of wheat tissues simultaneously. Wheat metabolites that were exclusively detected in FRR-infected seedlings (absent from the healthy tissue) were referred to as disease-induced in the resistant cv. Florence-Aurore (acronym, DIR). The untargeted AP-SMALDI-MS imaging experiments assigned in total 12, 52 and 31 DIR metabolites, each at 10, 14 and 21 dai (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Independent from the time-point examined, compounds belonging to lipid species (4 of 12 at 10 dai; 20 of 52 at 14 dai; 17 of 31 at 21 dai) and phenylpropanoid pathway (1 of 12 at 10 dai; 14 of 52 at 14 dai; 6 of 31 at 21 dai) formed major groups of predicted DIR metabolites. Detected phenylpropanoids were further classified into the downstream biosynthetic pathways of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs). HCAAs (conjugates of phenol-polyamines) and flavonoids were found to form the primary defense response of wheat against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> spreading in spikes. This applied to responses regulated by the major resistance locus <italic>Fhb1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] as well as to those induced by the major <italic>F. graminearum</italic> virulence factor DON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Phenylpropanoids and glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA) were essential for the metabolic defense arsenal associated with the resistance locus <italic>Fhb2</italic>, which specifically lowers the pathogen spread through the spike rachis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Increased activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway leads to physical and chemical barriers against pathogen infection or spreading. Here, associated cell-wall strengthening and antimicrobial compounds play a deciding role, as well as signaling molecules involved in local and systemic defense gene inductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Particularly, HCAAs have a dual function as phytoalexins and as cell wall strengthening agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The interplay between Florence-Aurore seedlings and <italic>F. graminearum</italic> involved also terpenoids, alkaloids and glycosides (in total: 4 of 12 at 10 dai; 10 of 52 at 14 dai; 4 of 31 at 21 dai),&#x02014;chemical groups that belong to the reported FHB inducible defense responses in wheat and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Particularly, terpenoids have frequently been associated with spike resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Molecular profiling of the response to FRR displayed by the resistant cultivar Florence-Aurore demonstrates that AP-SMALDI-MS imaging can confirm data from other MS techniques. Moreover, the observations suggest a basic overlap in the wheat response to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> spreading through stem and ear tissues. A corresponding observation has recently been made in a comparative study on the local and systemic expression of key FHB resistance genes in root, shoot and ear tissues, even though spike and root infection represent different pathosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Identification of wheat metabolites induced at the sites of fungal ingress</title><p id="Par26">Both the molecular and the microscopic analysis have shown that <italic>F. graminearum</italic> used the &#x0201c;epidermis-parenchyma route&#x0201d; to enter the shoot system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e, f). Consequently, the abaxial epidermis of leaf sheath is most vulnerable at the early stage of FRR disease spread. AP-SMALDI-MS imaging could map wheat compounds directly to this host&#x02013;pathogen interface that were co-localized with the fungal elicitor cerebroside C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, red) and the mycotoxin EN B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, red) as predictive factors for disease progression. At 10 dai, four DIR metabolites accumulated specifically in this vulnerable area (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The HCAA compound feruloylagmatine (<italic>m/z</italic> 307.1765) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c, green), the terpenoid iridotrial glucoside (m/z 345.1544) and the fatty acid oxo-octadecadiynoic acid (<italic>m/z</italic> 329,1514) were equally localized in limited areas of abaxial epidermis and adjacent vascular bundle, while the regulatory molecule adenosyl methionine (<italic>m/z</italic> 422.1343) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a&#x02013;c, red) was more widely distributed within the epidermis. Monoterpenes such as iridotrial glucoside and HCAAs such as feruloylagmatine are known to have antifungal properties that limit pathogen growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the adenosyl methionine plays a central role in the biosynthesis of various plant defense-related metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Only the predicted wheat compounds located in the outer leaf sheath epidermis were also reported as being induced in FHB resistant ears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Moreover, the concentration of putative FRR- and FHB-related compounds in this relatively small area coincides with the previous observation that infection rates and necrosis development are significantly lowered at 10 dai in the leaf sheaths of Florence-Aurore seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>FRR-induced changes in the tissue-specific synthesis of wheat metabolites uncovered by high-resolution AP-SMALDI mass spectrometry imaging. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Spatio-temporal distribution of FRR-induced metabolites mapped at 10&#x000a0;days after root inoculation (dai) with <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. <bold>a</bold> RGB overlay of <italic>m/z</italic> images representing the enhanced defensive state of leaf sheath epidermis.

</p><p id="Par27">Stem-specific DIR compounds were not detected at 10 dai (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1), which is consistent with the histological observation that the stem is not a primary site of host&#x02013;pathogen interaction at that time-point (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>i and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]).

Thirty-three of the 52 assigned DIR compounds were located in the stem, while stem-specific metabolites were almost absent at the other time-points (1 of in total 12 metabolites at 10 dai; 2 of in total 31 metabolites at 21 dai). This observation coincides with the histology-based assumption of a (temporary) protective stem response at 14 dai in FRR-infected Florence-Aurore seedlings. Here, confocal microscopy showed non-fungal fluorescence signals in bundle sheath cells surrounding the stem vascular bundles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>j). Besides chitin-containing particles present in fungal cell walls, the applied dye WGA Alexa Fluor 488<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can also stain enriched hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins of secondary plant cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In this context, first evidence for the existence of a systemic wheat response to root infection by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> has recently been reported, based on defense-related gene expressions in healthy stem and leaf tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A significant part of the stem reaction consisted of various flavonoids. These compounds were almost unique for this disease stage (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1) and were typically evenly distributed in the stem, such as the flavone kaempferol methyl ether glucuronide (<italic>m/z</italic> 499.0847) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d&#x02013;f, blue). Five metabolites were specifically synthesized in the vascular bundle region, such as the glycoside corchorusoside E (<italic>m/z</italic> 883.3934) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d&#x02013;f, red&#x02014;appears magenta due to overlay with the kaempferol derivative in blue). In contrast, the majority of metabolites (21 of 23) induced in the leaf sheath at 14 dai belonged to lipid species such as the phosphatidic acid PA(38:3) (<italic>m/z</italic> 765.4835) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d&#x02013;f, green).

Against this background, all five HCAA metabolites detected at 21 dai were specifically located in the leaf sheath vasculature (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), such as the compounds coumaroylagmatine (<italic>m/z</italic> 277.1657) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g&#x02013;i, blue) and feruloylserotonin (m/z 391.1055) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g&#x02013;i, red&#x02014;appears magenta due to overlay with coumaroylagmatine in blue), while phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids, such as PS(36:3) (<italic>m/z</italic> 824.4838) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>g&#x02013;i, green), were specifically induced in the leaf sheath of FRR-infected seedlings at 14 and 21 dai. AP-SMALDI-MS imaging has mapped HCAAs specifically to a tissue system that was microscopically identified as primary target within a sophisticated strategy used by the pathogen to invade upper plant parts of wheat. The vasculature is most likely an appropriate microhabitat for the pathogen by serving as nutrient niche and as important transmission route for the pathogen and its mycotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, the data suggest a &#x0201c;tissue-specific-on-demand-response&#x0201d; to protect vascular bundles from pathogen ingress and thus, to lower both the pathogen&#x000b4;s chance of survival and the systemic colonization of upper shoot internodes. The predicted compounds feruloylserotonin and coumaroylserotonin (<italic>m/z</italic> 277.1657) are well-known marker compounds of a pathogen-induced tryptophan pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], as was, for example, reported for the resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in ears of the model grass species <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In addition, the strengthening of ear rachis cell walls (in particular vascular bundles) as mechanism to lower <italic>F. graminearum</italic> spread has been confirmed by histological localization of HCAAs (e.g. coumaroylagmatine) and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this context, all five HCAA metabolites detected as components of a vascular protection (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were also reported from the corresponding protection in ear tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hence, AP-SMALDI-MS imaging suggested for the vascular tissue a conserved wheat reaction to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in different plant organs, similar to the observation made for the outer leaf sheath epidermis at 10 dai.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par29">The integrated histology and AP-SMALDI-MS imaging analysis presented in this study disclosed spatially and temporally dynamic zones of plant-pathogen interaction&#x02014;showing an oscillation between enhanced defensive states of leaf sheath (epidermis at 10 dai&#x02014;vasculature at 21 dai) and stem (at 14 dai). This dynamics provides insight toward chemical host responses that are locally induced at strategically important sites and, therefore, have a particular relevance for resistance. Hence, AP-SMALDI-MS imaging can provide plant pathologists with knowledge that is interesting with respect to the development of molecular-genetic approaches for disease management. For the generation of crop varieties with an improved yield-defense balance, the identification of local &#x0201c;defense-on-demand-responses&#x0201d; can be important. The allocation of metabolic resources to the production of defense compounds is often associated with a reduction in grain yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The outer epidermal layer and the vascular bundles of leaf sheath were, at different disease stages, identified as prominent sites of pathogen migration and wheat protection. Here, our data suggest certain metabolites (e.g. HCAAs) as key components of a wheat defense to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> that is induced independent of the plant organ or developmental stage. The detection of an overall resistance in wheat (cereals) could effectively help to control different <italic>Fusarium</italic> diseases. Moreover, the usability of AP-SMALDI-MS imaging for molecular histology was demonstrated. Mycotoxin classes that were hitherto unknown for <italic>F. graminearum</italic> were detected, demonstrating patterns of pathogenesis that were consistent with histological features observed by optical microscopy. This led to an in-depth understanding of the path of infection used by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> to colonize wheat plants upon root infection. Further imaging studies are necessary to consolidate these findings. These studies will aim at determining the spatial distribution of secondary metabolites in a direct comparison between compatible and incompatible interactions and/or wheat stem and spike responses to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In the optimal situation, after appropriate near isogenic lines are available, which minimize cultivar background effects as they differ solely in their reaction to FRR and/or FHB, as was proposed by Gauthier et al.
