    "Agricultural soils are becoming contaminated with synthetic chemicals like polyaromatic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols, herbicides, insecticides and fungicides due to excessive dependency of crop production systems on the chemical inputs. Microbial degradation of organic pollutants in the agricultural soils is a continuous process due to the metabolic multifunctionalities and enzymatic capabilities of the soil associated communities. The plant rhizosphere with its complex microbial inhabitants and their multiple functions, is amongst the most live and dynamic component of agricultural soils. We analyzed the metatranscriptome data of 20 wheat rhizosphere samples to decipher the taxonomic microbial communities and their multifunctionalities linked with the degradation of organic soil contaminants. The analysis revealed a total of 21 different metabolic pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds and 06 for the xenobiotics degradation. Taxonomic annotation of wheat rhizosphere revealed bacteria, especially the Proteobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, and cyanobacteria, which are shown to be linked with the degradation of aromatic compounds as the dominant communities. Abundance of the transcripts related to the degradation of aromatic amin compounds, carbazoles, benzoates, naphthalene, ketoadipate pathway, phenols, biphenyls and xenobiotics indicated abundant degradation capabilities in the soils. The results highlighted a potentially dominant role of crop rhizosphere associated microbial communities in the remediation of contaminant aromatic compounds."
