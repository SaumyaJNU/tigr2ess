After acute and chronic irradiation, the phenotypic effects on plant growth, germination rate, seedling height, and root length were examined, and the biochemical changes were investigated by analyzing the expression of antioxidant enzyme-related genes, antioxidant enzyme activities, and total antioxidant capacity. High dosages of chronic radiation reduced plant growth compared with the controls. Electron spin resonance measurement and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl activity analysis showed lower amount of free radicals in colored wheat seeds on chronic irradiation with low dosage of gamma rays compared to seeds subjected to acute irradiation. Expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, antioxidant-related genes, and antioxidant enzyme activity in seeds and young leaves of seedling showed diverse effects in response to different dosages and types of gamma irradiation. This suggests that phenotype is affected by the dosage and type of gamma radiation, and the phytochemicals in colored wheat seeds involved in antioxidant activity to scavenge free radicals respond differently to irradiation types. This provides evidence that acute and chronic exposure to radiation have different effects on seeds and young leaves after germination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Acute irradiation</kwd><kwd>chronic irradiation</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>electron spin resonance</kwd><kwd>anthocyanin</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ionizing radiation has been used as a tool in plant mutation breeding programs to select for new genotypes with improved crop characteristics. Types of ionizing radiations include alpha rays, beta rays, protons, X rays, cosmic rays, gamma rays, and high-energy UV rays. These forms of radiation cause ionization, but the various types of ionizing radiation have different energy levels and can penetrate cells to different degrees. Ionizing radiation generates highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may cause oxidative stress. ROS, including superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub>-), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radicals (OH), cause damage to membrane lipids (peroxidation), nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, resulting in subsequent cellular damage (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To avoid oxidative stress, plants activate several protective mechanisms that control the effects of ROS on the cell (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Foyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). One of the protective systems is the enzymatic defense mechanism that operates with sequential and simultaneous actions of a number of enzymes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>). ROS accumulation is controlled by antioxidant enzymes that include a variety of scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). SOD is the first defense line against ROS and plays a critical role in scavenging superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>-). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is enzymatically eliminated by CAT and several POD isoforms. APX is considered the most important H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenger, using ascorbate as the reducing agent (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Inz&#x000e9; and Van Montagu, 1995</xref>). The ascorbate-glutathione cycle includes various antioxidant enzymes such as APX, DHAR, GR, and MDAR, and this pathway is involved in the scavenging of O<sub>2</sub>- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Asada, 1999</xref>). In addition, antioxidant enzymes have been shown to increase tolerance to various stresses, such as salt, drought, and heat stress that can also cause oxidative stress. Thus, antioxidant enzymes play an essential role in maintaining the balance between the generation and scavenging of ROS increased by ionizing radiation.</p><p>Phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and carotenoids are believed to be effective in combating or providing protection against diseases due their antioxidant effect (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Iloki-Assanga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Colored maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) kernels possess a high content of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, which have been shown to have increased free radical scavenging activity (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zilic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Likewise, a profile of anthocyanins and other phenolics in Mexican maize also demonstrated increased free radical scavenging and reducing activities (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Martinez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In soybean with different seed color, varieties with black and brown seeds contained large amounts of total polyphenols and anthocyanins, which provide a high content of natural antioxidants (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Malencic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>High doses of gamma rays have usually been shown to have negative effects on plant height, shape, yield, and reproductive capacity, whereas exposure to lower doses has a simulative effect. A study of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings demonstrated that plants exposed to low-dose gamma irradiation (1&#x02013;5 Gy) developed normally (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Malencic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Pollen fertility decreased with the increase in dose rate in rice (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), whereas in potato, low-dose gamma irradiation (2.5 Gy) led to a significant increase in the number of microtubers (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Safadi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Although, radiosensitivity depends on the plant variety, harmful effects are more severe at higher doses and with higher dose rates. In addition, the type of irradiation effects can be divided into two categories according to dose intensity and periods of exposure. Acute irradiation is exposure to high doses of radiation for a short period, whereas chronic irradiation is continuous exposure to low doses of radiation over a long period.</p><p>A number of researchers have primarily studied the short-term effects of acute irradiation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">El-Beltagi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Moghaddam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marcu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kovalchuk <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> found that chronic irradiation caused a much higher frequency of homologous recombination (HR) compared to acute irradiation. Application of chronic radiation at 200 &#x003bc;Gy led to a five- to six-fold increase in the frequency of HR, whereas acute irradiation (dose range of 0.1&#x02013;0.5 Gy) did not increase the frequency of HR. Thus, through increased HR occurrence, chronic irradiation can produce a variety of genetic resources in plants. Several studies have been reported that effect of chronic gamma irradiation such as development of wild carrot plants, genetic variation in natural Melandrium album populations, and enzymatic hydrolysis as a pretreatment in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boratynski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Karimullina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). However, there is little information on the effect of chronic irradiation on the development and oxidative defense system of plants.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the biological responses induced by acute and chronic gamma exposure in colored wheat seeds, which could contain high amounts of natural antioxidants. The phenotypic effects of acute and chronic irradiation on plant growth, germination rate, seedling height, and root length were measured and the biochemical changes induced by exposing the plants to acute and chronic irradiation were investigated by analyzing the expression of antioxidant enzyme related genes, antioxidant enzyme activities, and total antioxidant capacity. The results of this study provide insights into the differing effects caused by the various dose intensities and exposure periods of gamma irradiation and provide valuable information of the ideal type of gamma irradiation for breeding programs to use as a mutagen source in crop plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and gamma irradiation</title><p>A hexaploid common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) line with colored-seeds developed by Korea University (accession no. K4191) were used. Seeds of K4191 were exposed to acute and chronic gamma irradiations at dosages of 100, 300, and 500 Gy The different doses are the total absorbed dose at the end of the exposure time, which means that for the same exposure times (two weeks) different dose rates were applied to reach final dosages (100, 300, and 500 Gy - acute dose rate: 12.5 Gy/h, 37.5 Gy/h and 62.5 Gy/h; chronic dose rate: 0.298 Gy/h, 0.893 Gy/h and 1.488 Gy/h). For chronic gamma irradiation, colored wheat seeds were exposed to gamma radiation generated by a <sup>60</sup>Co gamma irradiator (20 TBq of capacity, Nordion, Canada) for two weeks at 23&#x000b0;C in gamma phytotron room at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.</p><p>For acute irradiation, colored wheat seeds were stored in a control room with identical condition of the chronic irradiation facility for two weeks and irradiated for 8 h using a <sup>60</sup>Co gamma irradiator (150 TBq of capacity, AECL, Canada) in gamma irradiation facility on the last day of chronic irradiation treatment to terminate the two irradiation treatments simultaneously. Control seeds were also stored in same control room with identical condition for two weeks. After irradiation, seeds were stored at 4 &#x000b0;C for a short time and immediately used for further analysis.</p><p>Seeds for seedling samples were germinated for two to three days at room temperature and transferred to a Magenta box (6.5 x 6.5 x 20 cm, Greenpia Technology Inc. Seoul, Korea) containing polypro mesh as previously described (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hong <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>).

The water was freshly exchanged each day. To evaluate gamma ray sensitivity to the different doses, shoot length and root length of ten individual wheat seedlings with three biological replicates were scored by rulers. The germination assay was performed at constant temperature (25 &#x000b0;C) in a sterilized petri dish with water-soaked Whatman No.1 filter paper (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Germination rates of a total of 50 seeds with three biological replicates from each dosage and irradiation type treatment group were measured three days after imbibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron spin resonance measurement</title><p>Non-irradiated and irradiated seeds were freeze-dried for three days in preparation for electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. Each sample was weighed into a quartz ESR glass tube (diameter 5 mm). The glass tube was sealed with Whatman film (Whatman, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and stored in a dry-oven (65 &#x000b0;C) at 40% &#x000b1; 5% relative humidity. The ESR measurements were performed at room temperature using a JES-PX2300 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) X-band spectrometer equipped with a cylindrical cavity. The measurements were recorded using the following parameters: power, 0.998 mW; microwave frequency, 9.429 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 KHz; modulation width, 1 mT; magnetic center field, 337.812 mT; sweep time 30 s; time constant, 0.03 s. The ESR sample measurements were recorded simultaneously with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> standard sample set in the same resonator. Variations in ESR signal intensities were measured as the peak-to-peak signal width of the first-derivative spectrum. The signal intensity was expressed in arbitrary units per unit sample weight (AU/mg).</p></sec><sec><title>DPPH radical scavenging activity</title><p>The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-free radical scavenging capacity of irradiated colored wheat seeds was evaluated according to the method of <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Blois (1958)</xref>, with some modification.

Gamma rays are a more economical and effective tool compared to other ionizing radiation types because of their availability and penetration capacity. Generally, free radicals generated by ionization can have negative effects on plant germination, growth, morphology, and yield (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mittler, 2002</xref>). Additionally, stress signals and responses triggered by high doses of gamma irradiation have harmful effects on the physiological and biochemical traits of plants (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aly and El-Beltagi, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, in some cases, exposure to low levels of ionizing radiation is known to have a beneficial effect on plant growth, which is referred to as hormesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese, 2002</xref>). The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological responses induced by acute and chronic gamma irradiation in colored wheat seeds. Currently, most studies have been conducted and focused on the evaluation of the biological response to acute irradiation, whereas relatively few studies investigated the physiological response to chronic irradiation even though it has been shown that exposure to chronic gamma irradiation generates lower amounts of free radicals in comparison to acute irradiation in plants (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kovalchuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vandenhove <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our study indicates that acute and chronic irradiation of wheat may have different effects on plant growth and oxidative stress responses. Within gamma irradiation type treatment groups, the growth of plants treated with high doses of chronic irradiation was more reduced and caused severe growth inhibition compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Free radical molecules are induced by oxidative damage caused by various biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kocsy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Gamma rays can induce free radicals, and these molecules are strong oxidative stress factors that damage lipids, proteins, and DNA within plant cells (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Shikazono <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Moghaddam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These observations indicate that treatment with high doses of gamma irradiation has harmful effects on plant growth and development through the increase of free radicals. However, interestingly, the ESR signal of chronically irradiated colored wheat seeds was lower than that of non-irradiated seeds, and the DPPH radical scavenging activities were slightly increased in wheat treated with all dosage of chronic irradiation compared with both control and acute irradiated seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>When plants are exposed to gamma irradiation, free radical concentrations increase with increasing absorbed doses (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marcu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Flavonoids and polyphenols are compounds that protect cells against the oxidative effects of ROS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dangles, 2012</xref>). Anthocyanins are flavonoids, which are believed to be related to the overall antioxidant capacity of the plant. Anthocyanins function as major scavengers to eliminate free radicals (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Tsuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Radovanovic and Radovanovic, 2010</xref>). ESR signals showed that under chronic gamma irradiation conditions the wheat seeds had lower free radical content than acute gamma irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The anthocyanin contents were significantly higher in all dosages of chronically irradiated seeds than in acute-irradiated seeds, and high anthocyanin content following chronic irradiation could increase the capacity for free radical scavenging. Therefore, even though the seeds under the chronic irradiation condition were damaged more severely that after acute irradiation, it is supposed that phytochemicals such as anthocyanins in the colored wheat seeds affected the regulation of free radical contents caused by gamma irradiation. These results demonstrate that the antioxidant activity of anthocyanins is related to their ability for scavenging of free radicals.</p><p>Excessive ROS levels may cause cell injury and death because they can generate bimolecular oxidative stress (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Poljsak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). During an acute or chronic exposure to ionizing radiation, protective mechanisms like antioxidant enzymes are activated to scavenge for the ROS molecules (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Foyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Several studies provided proof of enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes following gamma irradiation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kovalchuk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Foyer and Noctor, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aly and El-Beltagi, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the expression of enzymatic antioxidant genes including <italic>SOD</italic>, <italic>CAT</italic>, <italic>APX</italic>, <italic>MDAR</italic>, <italic>DHAR</italic>, <italic>GR</italic>, and <italic>GPX</italic> and the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as POD, CAT, APX, and SOD were measured to compare the enzymatic antioxidants of the two irradiation types of dry seeds. Transcripts of two genes, <italic>CAT</italic> and <italic>CuZnSOD,</italic> were expressed at the maximal level after 100 Gy of chronic gamma irradiation and showed higher expression levels compared with control and acute irradiated dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, POD activity was higher in all dosage of chronic irradiated dry seeds, and CAT activity in dry seeds treated with chronic irradiation was higher than in acute irradiated dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). Although our results show that gene expression cannot be directly correlated with enzyme activity, various functions of antioxidant enzymes and their transcriptional regulation may still be involved in the cellular protection against ROS from both the environment and metabolism.</p><p>In young leaves of seedlings, low ESR signals were detected in chronically irradiated plants; High content of formed anthocyanin through chronic gamma irradiation in dry seeds may be involved in the compensatory mechanisms of inhibition of free radicals when wheat seedling growth. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). But, the patterns of anthocyanin and phenolic contents in seedlings did not correlate with those in dry seeds, and the transcription levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, antioxidant biosynthesis related genes, and antioxidant enzyme activities in seedlings did not show significant differences between the different type of gamma irradiation other than in a dosage dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">9</xref>). This result is important from the aspect of showing that the stimulatory effect of acute and chronic gamma irradiation doses for dry seeds and seedling growth may not be the same.</p><p>A previous study observed that chlorophyll content increased with increasing exposure to 100 Gy of gamma radiation in wheat (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Borzouei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In lettuce, the level of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>, carotenoids) increased at doses ranging from 2&#x02013;30 Gy, whereas at higher doses (up to 70 Gy) it decreased (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Marcu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Irradiation of red pepper (16 Gy) and lupine (20 Gy) resulted in a significant increase in the total chlorophyll content (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Khodary and Moussa, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In the current study, seeds irradiated with acute gamma doses ranging from 100 to 300 Gy had enhanced photosynthetic pigment content, but the chlorophyll content declined following chronic irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>). This indicates that the type of gamma irradiation differently affects chlorophyll contents and degradation. High doses of gamma irradiation cause a reduction in photosynthesis due to the disturbance of chlorophyll biosynthesis or degradation, concomitant with a loss of photosynthetic capacity (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Strid <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dale <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Chloroplasts are more susceptible to gamma irradiation than other organelles (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Wi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Most studies on the effects of radiation have investigated the high-acute external exposure on the plants. To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt that compares the effects of chronic and acute gamma irradiation in wheat. After colored wheat seeds were irradiated with acute and chronic gamma radiation at various doses (100, 300, and 500 Gy), their growth pattern inversely correlated with the gamma dose and was inhibited at higher doses. Although colored wheat seeds were treated with the same dose of irradiation with different type of exposure, remarkably plant growth was differently affected depending on type of gamma irradiation exposure. Chronic gamma irradiation caused severe damage and plant growth inhibition to wheat to a much greater extent than acute irradiation. However, the anthocyanin content in colored wheat seeds after chronic irradiation treatment was significantly higher than in the control.</p><p>Generally, high levels of free radicals can lead to the overproduction of ROS in plants, which ultimately results in oxidative stress. Increasing the content of free radicals through increased radiation dose may be related to the reduction in plant growth. Increasing the anthocyanin content can serve as a mechanism to regulate free radical contents. Therefore, it is supposed that phytochemicals in colored seed wheat exposed to chronic radiation treatment could affect total antioxidant capacity, such as ESR signal, free radical scavenging capacity, and antioxidant enzyme activities. In addition, radiosensitivity of wheat seeds depends on both the irradiation type, acute or chronic irradiation. Our study provides a valuable basis for further research on gamma-irradiation mediated mutagenesis in wheat.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Nuclear R&#x00026;D program by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP), and the research program of KAERI, Republic of Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>
