    "We aimed to investigate the biological responses induced by acute and chronic gamma irradiation in colored wheat seeds rich in natural antioxidants. After acute and chronic irradiation, the phenotypic effects on plant growth, germination rate, seedling height, and root length were examined, and the biochemical changes were investigated by analyzing the expression of antioxidant enzyme-related genes, antioxidant enzyme activities, and total antioxidant capacity. High dosages of chronic radiation reduced plant growth compared with the controls. Electron spin resonance measurement and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl activity analysis showed lower amount of free radicals in colored wheat seeds on chronic irradiation with low dosage of gamma rays compared to seeds subjected to acute irradiation. Expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, antioxidant-related genes, and antioxidant enzyme activity in seeds and young leaves of seedling showed diverse effects in response to different dosages and types of gamma irradiation. This suggests that phenotype is affected by the dosage and type of gamma radiation, and the phytochemicals in colored wheat seeds involved in antioxidant activity to scavenge free radicals respond differently to irradiation types. This provides evidence that acute and chronic exposure to radiation have different effects on seeds and young leaves after germination."
