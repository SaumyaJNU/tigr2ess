    "During plant-pathogen interactions, plants have to defend the living transposable elements from pathogens. In response to such elements, plants activate a variety of defense mechanisms to counteract the aggressiveness of biotic stressors. RNA interference (RNAi) is a key biological process in plants to inhibit gene expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, using three different groups of proteins to resist the virulence of pathogens. However, pathogens trigger an anti-silencing mechanism through the expression of suppressors to block host RNAi. The disruption of the silencing mechanism is a virulence strategy of pathogens to promote infection in the invaded hosts. In this review, we summarize the RNA silencing pathway, anti-silencing suppressors, and counter-defenses of plants to viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens."
