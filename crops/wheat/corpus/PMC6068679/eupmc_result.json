    "Dairy and cereal are frequently combined to create composite foods with enhanced nutritional benefits. Dehydrated fermented milk⁻wheat composites (FMWC) were prepared by blending fermented milk (FM) and parboiled wheat (W), incubating at 35 °C for 24 h, drying at 46 °C for 48 h, and milling to 1 mm. Increasing the weight ratio of FM to W from 1.5 to 4.0 resulted in reductions in total solids (from 96 to 92%) and starch (from 52 to 39%), and increases in protein (15.2⁻18.9%), fat (3.7⁻5.9%), lactose (6.4⁻11.4%), and lactic acid (2.7⁻4.2%). FMWC need to be reconstituted prior to consumption. The water-holding capacity, pasting viscosity, and setback viscosity of the reconstituted FMWC (16.7% total solids) decreased with the ratio of FM to W. The reconstituted FMWC exhibited pseudoplastic flow behaviour on shearing from 18 to 120 s-1. Increasing the FM:W ratio coincided with a lower yield stress, consistency index, and viscosity at 120 s-1. The results demonstrate the critical impact of the FM:W ratio on the composition, pasting behavior, and consistency of the reconstituted FMWC. The difference in consistency associated with varying the FM:W ratio is likely to impact on satiety and nutrient value of the FMWCs."
