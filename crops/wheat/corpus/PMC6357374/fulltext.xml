In 2017 Uganda experienced a Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) outbreak with case fatality rate of 100% in Kween district. Although hunting for wild meat was linked to the MVD outbreak in Kween district, less was reported on the land use changes, especially the changing animal grazing practices in Kween district.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Through Makerere University One Health graduate fellowship program with attachment to Uganda Red Cross Society, a study was conducted among the agricultural communities to elucidate the risk behaviors in Kween district that can be linked to the 2017 Marburg disease outbreak.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Results show that although a few elderly participants ascribed fatal causes (disobedience to gods, ancestors, and evil spirits) to the MVD outbreak during FGDs, majority of participants linked MVD to settling in caves (inhabited by Fruit Bats) during wet season as upper belts are extensively used for crop production leaving little space for animal grazing. Members also noted side activities like hunting for wild meat during this grazing period that could have predisposed them to Marburg Virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">There is need to integrate One Health concepts within agricultural extension service provision in Uganda so as to enhance the management of such infectious diseases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Agriculture</kwd><kwd>Livelihoods</kwd><kwd>Zoonotic diseases</kwd><kwd>One health</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) is one of the viral hemorrhagic fevers that affects both humans and non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. First outbreaks of Marburg occurred in Germany in 1967 with links to monkeys which were imported from Uganda for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Marburg Virus Disease is caused by a filovirus similar to Ebola that belongs to the family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>. The Marburg virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates ranging between 24 and 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>Rousettus aegypti</italic> fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, are considered to be natural hosts of Marburg virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through human-to-human transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers have been recorded in Uganda with some linked to foreign travels to Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Four MVD outbreaks have been reported in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The first recorded outbreak was in 2007, where three cases and one death were reported in a community associated with mining activities in the districts of Kamwenge and Ibanda, Western Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In 2012, MVD was responsible for 26 cases with 15 deaths affecting multiple districts and in 2014, Kampala, Uganda&#x02019;s capital city so far has reported only one case diagnosed with Marburg virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Outbreaks of MVD are believed to occur because of close interaction of humans and animals such as non-human primates, bats, and livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Most of the Marburg disease outbreaks in Uganda have been linked to bat species <italic>Rousettus aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most recent outbreak of Marburg in Kween district, Eastern part of Uganda in 2017 was linked to consumption of meat from a bat by a hunter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is similar to other outbreaks like the one in Ibanda and Kamwenge districts of Western parts of Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Apart from effects related to morbidity and mortality, the disease disrupts the country&#x02019;s economy, causes social suffering of the affected families and reduces household productivities among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Its ability to spread beyond borders implies it can disrupt trade between countries reducing foreign exchange. The impacts of Marburg disease outbreaks are similar to the impacts of other hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] that have also caused havoc in the Eastern Africa region in the recent past.</p><p id="Par9">Most of these zoonotic disease outbreaks occur as a result of the changing economic activities that increase human-animal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Such changing economic activities include conversion of natural forests into farmland increasing chances of flooding which is a risk factor for diseases like leptospirosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Examination of a mine in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo revealed bats that were found to have Marburg viruses on being examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This implies that the people who worked in such a mine risked contracting the Marburg viral disease. Uganda currently uses multidisciplinary approaches under the auspices of National One Health Task Force during investigation of such outbreaks. Makerere University is also embracing One Health approaches in community engagement through pairing up students with organizations like Uganda Red Cross Society practicing One Health approaches.</p><p id="Par10">The 2017 MVD outbreak in Kween district was the first of its kind and was linked to hunting of bats. However, little has been done thus far to study the economic activities undertaken by the people of Kween that might predispose people to getting in contact with potential hosts for MVD. This research therefore focused on cattle rearing practices by the people of Kween, Eastern Uganda and their risk of contracting Marburg disease. This research focused on lowland grazing which normally happens during wet seasons of the year and corresponded with the 2017 Marburg disease outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par11">The study was undertaken in Kween District in Eastern Uganda located at 01 25&#x02009;N, 34 31E (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Kween district borders several districts namely: Nakapiripirit to the north, Amudat to the northeast, Bukwo to the east, Kapchorwa to the west and Bulambuli to the northwest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the south, it boarders with the Republic of Kenya. The district headquarters are located at Binyiny; approximately 69&#x02009;km by road from Mbale, one of the largest towns in eastern Uganda. Kween district is one of the youngest districts in Uganda having been created by the Act of Parliament and becoming operational on 1st July 2010. Originally, it was part of Kapchorwa district and together with Kapchorwa and Bukwo district, they form the Sebei sub-region. The district is located on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon, at an average altitude of about 1900&#x02009;m (6,200 Feet) above sea level.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location of the study area (Kween district)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_6477_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">In the three-national population census especially of 1991, 2002 and 2012, the district population was estimated at 37,300, 67,200 and 103,300 respectively Uganda Bureau of Statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The two communities were selected because they are near the lowlands and also represent the communities living up-high on the slopes of Mount Elgon within the district. About six (6) Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in the two study communities. About three FGDs were undertaken in each of the two communities. Sixty (60) participants nominated by community members to represent them took part in the FGDs. FGD participants were grouped according to age and gender. Both male and female adults were aged 25&#x02009;years and above.</p><p id="Par16">The participants were also classified based on their education status and sources of income. The challenges faced by the participants in pursuing their livelihoods were noted during the discussion process. Pre-designed focus group discussion guide were used and the discussions were conducted. A facilitator, note-taker and a tape recorder were utilized during the discussions. The discussions revolved around perceptions of participants on the link between lowland grazing and MVD and on the cattle grazing practices undertaken in the lower belt. The FGDs were conducted in <italic>Kupsabiny</italic>, the local language mostly used in the area. Consent was obtained from the participants and community leaders before the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par17">For qualitative data from FGDs, analysis was conducted using thematic framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This involved; familiarization, and identification of thematic frameworks; indexing; charting; mapping and interpretation. Recorded audio tape was listened to and the transcripts and observational notes taken during the discussions were used to enhance familiarization with the information gathered. This allowed identification of emerging dominant themes during the discussions. In indexing, analysis of the transcript was undertaken with use of codes from the responses obtained in order to sort out interesting quotes from the transcripts with the aid of NVivO coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A determination was then made of the emerging themes in line with the study objectives. Subsequently, a coding frame was developed and coded data was mapped and interpreted. Throughout this, particular attention was paid to the context, comments, and words in order to enhance the internal consistency of the data. Triangulation techniques, in the form of discussions with key community leaders were used to reduce potential bias effects in the data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demographics of participants</title><p id="Par18">Around 60 respondents were interviewed during this study with ages of about 51&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;24&#x02009;years.

The main challenges faced by farmers are pests and diseases. Even though grazing is one of the main activities, they did mention that hunting was common activity during grazing of animals. Setting of traps and eating of monkey meat was one of the activities identified in lowland areas during this study. Studies by Blumberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] among others have shown a link between eating bush meat and occurrence of viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola. Results of this study show that community members have their own perspectives about Marburg like causes of its occurrence. This is similar to what Hewlett and Amolat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found out in Gulu district of Uganda following an Ebola outbreak. Local views about hemorrhagic fevers exists in the affected communities regarding its causes and control. Such local views about an infectious disease like Marburg can provide a measure of the level of knowledge within a community about filoviruses for proper design of public policy. A clear understanding of activities that can lead to Marburg Virus outbreak as illustrated in this paper allows for design of messages to ensure reduced risk of future outbreaks. Such issues and activities include; shortage of fertilizers for use in crop production resulting into use of droppings from bats, mining of rock salt in caves for animals among others. This is similar to the results of the 2012 Marburg disease outbreaks in Uganda in the districts of Ibanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, studies by Green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and Adjemian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]did not consider other factors that drive people to doing the mining activities as highlighted in this study.</p><p id="Par50">Farmers had a belief that bats can potentially spread Marburg to them and their animals. They also believe that access to caves and grazing lands by baboons and monkeys can potentially spread Marburg to farmers. This study is similar to that of Brauburger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that linked the 1967 Marburg outbreaks in Germany to the monkeys that were imported from Uganda. However, his studies did not also include the community&#x02019;s perspective about such disease outbreaks. Chandler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] also notes that design of messages of hope are key in containing infectious diseases like Marburg. A clear understanding of the economic activities like animal grazing are key in design and ensuring effectiveness of such messages and public policy. Natural resource management systems like land tenure systems are key in addressing infectious diseases like Marburg. According to Andersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], land tenure management systems are key to sustainable land management systems. Communal land ownership leads to a tragedy of commons where no one takes the responsibility of say clearing off growing <italic>Lantana camara</italic> that would provide conditions for settlement of wild animals that might be carrying disease causing pathogens. In this case, establishment of routes of escape and places of settlement for organisms harboring fruit bats and monkeys within human settlements can pose a risk of spillover of such pathogens like Marburg Virus to humans. Land tenure systems are therefore key in designing public policy to prevent emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases like Marburg disease. As O&#x02019;Shea et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] notes the likelihood of filoviruses evolving in response to changing environmental conditions due to bat migrations, in this case, settling in caves (habitats for fruit bats) during animal rearing in lowland areas can lead to migration of bats to more open habitats. Such movements can alter the metabolism of the bat causing alteration of the filoviruses like that of Marburg disease increasing its spill over to humans.</p><p id="Par51">This study was however limited by the inability to interview individuals directly affected by Marburg disease in Kween district. The study was also conducted at a much later time when people were not remembering well information regarding Marburg disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">It was generally perceived that settling in caves during lowland grazing could increase the chances of contact with bats. Furthermore, the activities listed by participants, such as mining, grazing of cattle and hunting which are undertaken in the lowland areas can increase It was generally perceived that settling in caves during lowland grazing could increase the chances of contact with bats. Furthermore, the activities listed by participants, such as mining, grazing of cattle and hunting which are undertaken in the lowland areas can increase human-animal animal interaction. Although a few participants ascribed fatal causes (disobedience to gods, ancestors, and evil spirits) to the MVD outbreak during FGDs, majority of participants rightly linked MVD to settling in caves (inhabited by Fruit Bats) during wet season as upper belts are extensively used for crop production leaving little space for animal grazing. Members also noted side activities like hunting for wild meat during this grazing period that could have predisposed them to Marburg Virus. They were therefore of the view that future changes in animal rearing practices will further exacerbate the zoonotic diseases outbreaks in their communities if appropriate interventions are not put in place.</p><p id="Par53">There is need to integrate One Health concepts into agricultural extension service provision in Uganda so as to enhance the management of such infectious diseases. All stakeholders involved in agricultural production (crop, and livestock) need to be acquainted with the concepts of One Health so as to ensure the environment-human-animal interaction is balanced. Otherwise leaving public health officers only to tackle such diseases wont yield much. There is need for more research also on the link between livelihood strategies like lowland grazing among others and Marburg disease outbreaks.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>FGDS</term><def><p id="Par5">Focus group discussions</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to One Health Central and Eastern Africa (OHCEA) for establishing a establishing a platform that allows for field engagement by graduate students.
