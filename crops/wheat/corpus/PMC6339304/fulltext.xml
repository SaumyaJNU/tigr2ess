The impetus was acute need for a better understanding of previously undocumented uses of cycads in this region, and the need to improve cycad conservation strategies using ethnobotanical data. We hypothesized that cycads are significant dietary items with no long-term neurological effects, are important to religious practice, and contribute to cultural identity and sense of place, but that traditional knowledge and uses are rapidly eroding. Guiding questions focused on nomenclature, food and toxicity, relationships to palms and maize, land management issues, roles in religious ceremony, and medicinal uses, among others, and contributions of these to preservation of cycads.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">From 2000 to 2017, the authors conducted 411 semi-structured ethnographic interviews, engaged in participant-observation in Mexican and Honduran communities, and carried out archival research and literature surveys.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We documented 235 terms and associated uses that 28 ethnic groups have for 57 species in 19 languages across 21 Mexican states and 4 Central American nations. Carbohydrate-rich cycads have been both famine foods and staples for at least six millennia across the region and are still consumed in Mexico and Honduras. Certain parts are eaten without removing toxins, while seed and stem starches are detoxified via several complex processes. Leaves are incorporated into syncretic Roman Catholic-Mesoamerican religious ceremonies such as pilgrimages, Easter Week, and Day of the Dead. Cycads are often perceived as ancestors and protectors of maize, revealing a close relationship between both groups. Certain beliefs and practices give cycads prominent roles in conceptions of sense of place and cultural heritage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Cycads are still used as foods in many places. Though they do not appear to cause long-term neurological damage, their health effects are not fully understood. They are often important to religion and contribute to cultural identity and sense of place. However, because most traditional knowledge and uses are rapidly eroding, new community-based biocultural conservation efforts are needed. These should incorporate tradition where possible and seek inspiration from existing successful cases in Honduras and Mexico.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13002-018-0282-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cycads</kwd><kwd><italic>Zea mays</italic></kwd><kwd>Community-based conservation</kwd><kwd>Maize gods</kwd><kwd>Zamiaceae</kwd><kwd>Teenek Maya</kwd><kwd>Nahua</kwd><kwd>Ethnobotany of cycads</kwd><kwd>Neurotoxicity of cycads</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008321</institution-id><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID0EFVAE1346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonta</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Delta State University</institution></funding-source><award-id>ID0EW1AE1347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonta</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006400</institution-id><institution>Universidad Aut&#x000f3;noma del Estado de Hidalgo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID0EGAAG1348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pulido-Silva</surname><given-names>Mar&#x000ed;a Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005324</institution-id><institution>Universidad Aut&#x000f3;noma de San Luis Potos&#x000ed;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID0EVGAG1351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cibri&#x000e1;n-Jaramillo</surname><given-names>Ang&#x000e9;lica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Montgomery Botanical Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>ID0EGMAG1352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonta</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID0EVRAG1353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonta</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Montgomery Botanical Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>ID0EX3AG1355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cibri&#x000e1;n-Jaramillo</surname><given-names>Ang&#x000e9;lica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">This study of historical and contemporary traditional roles of cycads in human societies documents and analyzes fading uses and knowledge, and places emphasis on aspects of cycad ethnobotany that can aid conservation strategies. Cycads (Order Cycadales) are dioecious, cone-bearing gymnosperms with 351 known species of Miocene origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] currently distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. They are the world&#x02019;s most threatened group of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Mexico and northern Central America (MNCA), of the 71 recognized native species, 21 are critically endangered, 23 endangered, and the rest in lesser risk categories, with only 1 least concern species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They are threatened by cattle ranching, habitat destruction, the illicit nursery trade, and climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Though MNCA cycads are protected on paper in response to CITES, additional on-the-ground measures are necessary. MNCA governments have engaged conservationists, scientists, existing parks, and local communities to protect cycads, but results have been spotty. Ex situ efforts such as community nurseries incentivizing habitat conservation through seed harvest, propagation, legal plant sales, and reintroduction have been marginally successful due to bureaucratic insufficiency and lack of marketing and follow-up studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recognition, rescue, and interpretation of cycad ethnobotanical knowledge, a collaborative process between knowledge-holders and outside experts, is vitally important to help community-based biocultural conservation initiatives, and revalorize sense of place and cultural identity, effectively providing a more broad-based and deeply rooted way to protect and sustain cycads, in particular in Latin America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as examples later in this article from Chiapas, northeastern Mexico (NEMX), and Honduras show [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Misconceptions and avoidance of cycad ethnobotanical research</title><p id="Par17">A fundamental impetus for this study was the lack of attention to cycads in the social sciences and the proliferation of false assumptions about them. While biologists have studied cycads extensively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], social scientists have perceived them at best as minor and marginal food resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. At worst, their use as food is often assumed to cause long-term neurological damage to humans, even though attempts to establish a causal link between cycad consumption and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS-PDC are inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The &#x0201c;cycad hypothesis,&#x0201d; an assertion that the putative long-term neurotoxicity of <italic>Cycas micronesica</italic> (formerly <italic>C</italic>. <italic>circinalis</italic>) in the US territory of Guam is the cause for litigo-bodig (a local form of ALS-PDC syndrome), provided post-1960 researchers the justification to study a neurological disease cluster among Chamorros who had consumed cycads heavily as recently as the 1940s and, some studies suggested as a direct result, suffered from extremely high rates of litigo-bodig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, studies of Chamorros did not take numerous environmental and genetic factors into consideration, chief among them other environmental toxin sources as well as the fact that cycad seeds, to be detoxified, were in the 1940s steeped in water-filled, lead paint-coated oil drums. Despite the lack of proof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the assertion that Chamorros&#x02019; consumption of cycads, or of fruit bats that consumed cycads (through putative biomagnification of the toxins in bat muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]), causes long-term neurodegeneration came to be the scientific consensus. Purported but never vindicated reports of cycad neurodegenerative links in Honshu and New Guinea broadened the &#x0201c;cycad hypothesis&#x0201d; to the Western Pacific region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Extensive historical reviews of cycad ethnobotany appeared in the mid-twentieth century, highlighting their uses as staple foods and famine resources as well as for starch production, alcohol, medicine, narcotics, and ceremony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While some cycad parts were eaten raw or with little processing, seed and stem starch necessitated complicated, multi-day procedures to render them safe. And though humans have consumed cycads, often in large quantities, since the Pleistocene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], other than the unproven cases in three Western Pacific locations, long-term neurodegenerative effects have never been documented anywhere else. Cycad-eating cultures universally know that some parts of the plants are acutely toxic and can cause serious sickness and death, and thus that their toxins must be rendered safe before consumption. Nevertheless, the engrained support for the idea that cycads cause long-term neurodegeneration appears to be the primary reason for the dearth of ethnobotanical studies after the 1960s. Simply put, the dominant assumption is that humans consume cycads only as a last resort because they are so toxic, and therefore they can never have been important in human diets, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One of this study&#x02019;s primary aims was to test this assertion, as it can affect any attempt to promote community-based conservation based on preservation of traditional practices related to their importance as food.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Brief summary of post-1960 cycad ethnobotany</title><p id="Par20">Apart from significant work in Australia, and the voluminous Western Pacific toxicity studies, modern cycad ethnobotanical publications have been minimal and scattered. In summary, (1) cycads are still used widely for food and other reasons in the Americas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and some Pacific islands, though rarely as extensively as reported historically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Though we are far from identifying all cycad-eating societies, it is clear that in many cases, users&#x02019; poverty and remoteness from markets is directly related to whether or not they still consume the plants, given increased availability of less risky and labor-intensive foods with modernization. Cycad consumption is not necessarily a direct function of dire need, however, because they are also eaten for their value as sacraments, casual snacks, and representatives of valued cultural heritage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. (2) Cycads are high-status plants associated with power and conferring prestige, e.g., in Vanuatu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], among the Yanyuwa of Arnhem Land, Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], in Panama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As a result, uses and knowledge of cycads have often been kept secret from outsiders. (3) Leaves are still used for religious ceremonies in numerous contexts across the world, and have manifold ritual meanings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. (4) Cycads and their parts are traded licitly and illicitly both from nursery stock and by extraction from the wild.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cycad biology in Mexico and northern Central America</title><p id="Par21">MNCA cycads belong to three genera (<italic>Dioon</italic>&#x02014;15 species; <italic>Ceratozamia</italic>&#x02014;31 species; <italic>Zamia</italic>&#x02014;25 species) in the family Zamiaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Of the three genera, <italic>Dioon</italic> spp. are typically the largest, with stems to 10&#x000a0;m in length and 50&#x000a0;cm in girth or branching at the base.

Female cones take many months to reach maturity and dehisce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Seeds are dispersed by gravity and by vertebrates transporting and caching them for their sarcotestas (fleshy, sugary outer seed coverings) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In areas where people eat them, cycad cones are usually harvested while still on the stems, and few seeds are left behind. The timing of coning is irregular and apparently depends on a range of factors, including fire, which may occur more than once a year in a single location. Fire stimulates new leaf and cone production through nutrient release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Cycads generally produce a new leaf flush annually or biennially; the leaf scars left on the trunks of larger species can be used to establish age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">MNCA cycads tolerate diverse environments, and are most often found on steep, rocky terrain with low nutrient availability.

Cycads grow in grasslands, pine, oak and pine-oak woodlands, tropical dry forest, arid deciduous scrub, and thick, moist evergreen forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Their unique adaptations include nitrogen-fixing coralloid roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], extreme fire- and drought-tolerance, and the capacity to produce numerous offshoots and clones, in some cases as a result of damage. Overall, cycads are remarkably persistent in the face of damage, where not subject to massive anthropogenic destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Aims of the study</title><p id="Par24">The aims of the research that comprises this study were (1) use ethnographic and ethnohistorical methods to collect, consolidate, and streamline a fragmentary, confusing, and anecdotal ethnobotanical knowledge base; (2) elucidate important questions with major ramifications for understanding human relationships to cycads in MNCA and to a certain extent elsewhere in the world; and (3) provide a knowledge base for community-conservation strategies. We were guided by the following questions: (1) What roles have cycads played in human diets? (2) What are the adverse health effects of cycad consumption on people? (3) What are the relationships of cycads to other plants such as palms and maize (given the indication of strong ties to cycads as evinced in nomenclature and previous studies)? (4) What are the meanings of ritual cycad use in Catholic and syncretic ceremonies? (5) How are cycads incorporated into traditional land-use management? (6) How do cycads contribute to sense of place and cultural identity? (7) How are minor uses such as for ethnomedicine related to the other questions? (8) Can human knowledge of cycads be incorporated into conservation strategies? We formulated the following hypotheses: (1) cycads have been and remain important food plants despite their toxicity. (2) Traditional cycad food-processing techniques prevent long-term effects on human neurological health. (3) Cycads are integral to traditional religious practice, particularly because of their close relationships to palms and maize. (4) The importance of food, ceremony, and minor uses have led to heightened sense of place and cultural identity and stimulated traditional protection measures designed to help preserve cycads. (5) Cycad ethnobotanical knowledge, uses, and traditional protection measures are being rapidly eroded across the entire region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par25">To answer our questions and address our hypotheses, we broadly followed standard qualitative ethnobotanical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

For cycad paleoethnobotany, we sought to establish how long and in what regions and contexts cycads had been used. We subjected these scant data to minimal interpretation, and flag excavation methods, chronological uncertainty, and other factors that limit their utility. Our historical component sought to elucidate cycad ethnobotany from Spanish-Indigenous contact around 1500 through the late 1900s. We scanned full-text databases (e.g., Google Books) using common local names such as &#x0201c;teocintle&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;chamal,&#x0201d; and their variants, to locate non-indexed references. For these searches, we focused on works in geographic areas where the terms refer only to cycads and where the plant descriptions clearly indicated that cycads were being discussed.</p><p id="Par27">The few published Colonial-era herbals were also examined, and certain unpublished archival materials were viewed. Except in Honduras, our archival research was quite partial, given the vast, mostly unindexed and un-scanned resources available in local and national repositories across MNCA and in Spain. The primary means we used to reconstruct post-1900 historical ethnobotany was via oral history questions that we incorporated in ethnographic interviews. We did not gather data on the commercial nursery trade, an important factor to consider for community-based conservation studied and quantified elsewhere, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. We released preliminary findings in public presentations, unpublished reports, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and a few popular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and scholarly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] articles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Geographic scope</title><p id="Par28">Though as a whole they are scattered across MNCA, cycads occur in limited areas and are completely absent from the Mexican central plateau and other arid highland areas.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Given striking ethnobotanical similarities between Honduras and Mexico that originally sparked our curiosity and collaborations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], we included both countries as well as intervening Guatemala, El Salvador, and Belize where we were not able to undertake fieldwork. We came to focus on NEMX because of its accessibility to our research facilities combined with its rich existing cycad ethnobotany quite similar to that of Honduras. As our questions and hypotheses evolved, time and funds permitting, we visited other MNCA locations to broaden our scope and fill in gaps between NEMX and Honduras. Our efforts were far from exhaustive and an enormous amount of work remains to be done, including the integration of genetic evidence that helps test some of our hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Literature issues</title><p id="Par30">Definitions and delineations of MNCA cycad species have varied based on differing interpretations of genetic and phenotypical characteristics. At present, full and recent taxonomic descriptions and revisions exist for many species, while monographs have been produced of the cycads for a few areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

If free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) was granted us, we asked local collaborators questions about cycads, and we also engaged in open-ended discussion. We focused our in-depth interviews on people that local authorities and other contacts deemed most knowledgeable about plants. In general, these were people over 50&#x000a0;years of age, though we also talked with younger people who were recognized as particularly knowledgeable. We did not thus focus on a representative cross-section of the population but rather on detecting the greatest amount of in-depth cycad knowledge in the time available to us, which repeated experience had taught us was closely associated with the age of the interviewee. In circumstances where we had limited time, we sought only the most elderly informants. We requested that local contacts and authorities provide us access to 50% men and 50% women. In the small, rural communities that we visited, our target was to be able to spend 2 or 3&#x000a0;days carrying out at least five in-depth interviews with women and five with men. This was not always possible, however, for a range of reasons, particularly including knowledge loss that resulted in less than ten total people having any in-depth knowledge whatsoever of cycads. Some communities only yielded exploratory interviews, or no data at all despite the presence of cycads.</p><p id="Par32">See Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for research guides and translations of Spanish-language question banks from which we drew. The extent and depth of questions grew over time, because when we began we had little idea of the dimensions of cycad knowledge and the answers that we would encounter, and virtually no prior studies to guide us. We selected questions for each community and circumstance based on our background knowledge of socioeconomic conditions, cultural and political sensitivities, and other contextual issues including any concerns that arose during the process of garnering FPIC. Therefore, in general, two sample strategies were applied: first, open interviews and then, semi-structured interviews.</p><p id="Par33">Prior to asking exploratory questions, we always sought to determine if the potential interviewee was familiar with any of the local cycads we thought should be present according to published botanical studies, examination of herbarium vouchers, and personal communication with botanists. Ethnobotany research carried out in Hidalgo and San Lu&#x000ed;s Potos&#x000ed; was preceded by detailed population biological studies of all cycads species present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We confirmed the botanical identity and ethnobotany information with the aid of AV, who is the national expert in Zamiaceae in Mexico. The botanical vouchers are available at HGOM and XAL herbaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We typically evoked a well-known local name and showed a cycad leaf or other part, a herbarium voucher, or a color photo. We also mixed in photos of similar local plants to establish whether or not the potential interviewee was actually talking about cycads. In many cases, cycads are confused with palms, ferns, pine trees, and other plants, particularly in regions where substantial knowledge erosion has taken place. If possible, we had the potential interviewee show us what they thought was a cycad plant of their own volition&#x02014;i.e., in a nearby woods or their garden. In addition, given the extensive work that has been done by biologists, it was usually easy for us to identify local cycad species, which are typically limited to a handful in any given locale, with little potential for confusion. Any uncertainties are flagged (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p><p id="Par34">If we established that the potential interviewee was familiar with cycads, then with their permission, an open, exploratory interview usually commenced, focusing on its names, and if these were in an Indigenous language, we asked the interviewee or a family member, guide, or interpreter to write them phonetically. Names were also recorded on audio, if possible. Whether or not names were known, we asked whether any uses were known. Depending on the nature of the responses, open exploratory interviews lasted from 5 to 30&#x000a0;min, and if conditions were amenable, these became in-depth, semi-structured interviews. In many cases, however, in-depth interviews were left for a later time, to allow the interviewee to collect their thoughts. Where very little was known, we asked the interviewee (or they responded unsolicited) who would possibly know more, thus a snowball sampling method of potential interviewees was used in some communities. In Teenek, Nahua, and certain other Indigenous communities, where we apprised community leaders of the nature of the research, they met to decide whether to grant FPIC, and if they did, thence accompanied us or let us go solo or with an interpreter to interview our target of ten pre-designated elderly cycad experts. Each community was quite distinct in how it approached our research, and in some regions and contexts, particularly in non-Indigenous areas, it was not necessary to do more than inform local leaders of our presence and purpose and show letters of introduction from our research institutions. In some cases, local leaders evinced marginal or no interest in what we were doing and told us there was no need to garner their permission; in such contexts, we sought FPIC person by person.</p><p id="Par35">In-depth interviews lasted 30&#x000a0;min to 2&#x000a0;h, over one or more sessions. Depending on FPIC strictures, we recorded interviews via written notes, audio, and/or video. Interviewees&#x02019; family members and friends often stood by, sometimes engaging in discussions and debates about cycad knowledge. Interpreters were utilized in the case of interviewees who did not or preferred not to speak in Spanish. Interviews took place at the time and place of the interviewees&#x02019; choosing, typically in their homes and gardens. We gave sufficient opportunity for interviewees to provide as much detail as they wished.</p><p id="Par36">Research protocols followed the authors&#x02019; Institutional Review Boards&#x02019; and professional ethical guidelines and requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and though our studies were exempted from necessity to provide human subject protections, we protected interviewee identities and sometimes community names and locations nonetheless (no names or other personal identifiers have been retained). In Honduras, this was due to risk of human rights abuses of interviewees and collaborators by government authorities and other actors, such as those that followed the 2009 <italic>coup d</italic>&#x02019;<italic>&#x000e9;tat</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Mexico, though we did not find this to be the case, we opted to hide identities and localities to impede plant traffickers who access published data to find informants who can point them to cycad populations. This is a serious problem in Mexico, a result of the extremely high value of cycads for domestic and foreign decorative use and is why exact geographical coordinates of population locations for most cycads should not be revealed in publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">As an additional precaution, we carefully explained to collaborators and authorities, whom we assumed were unaware, that cycads are sometimes utilized for secret and even illicit purposes connected to ethnomedicine and narcotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, they could tell potential interviewees to be wary of what knowledge they chose to divulge, and explain that any knowledge divulged inadvertently could, upon an interviewee&#x02019;s or community&#x02019;s request, be destroyed and/or remain unpublished at any point ex post facto. Though we were never asked to destroy our data, in several cases potential interviewees&#x02014;typically traditional healers and shamans&#x02014;whom local authorities had identified and recommended to us did not wish to be interviewed once they learned the exact nature of our research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant observation</title><p id="Par38">In NEMX and Honduras, we stayed in local homes over the course of days and in some cases weeks, affording us the opportunity to gain trust.

MacNeish, who characterized the cycads as &#x0201c;poisonous nuts&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], afforded their overwhelming quantity in La Perra only limited importance; in the same strata as the cycad remains, tiny maize stole the show as the earliest evidence of domesticated maize recorded at the time. But with maize only appearing in very small quantities, MacNeish concluded that La Perra had functioned as a seasonal wild plant foraging camp. Given that large <italic>chamal</italic> populations still exist throughout the Sierra, some quite close to La Perra, we suggest that the shelter was specifically a seasonal cycad harvesting encampment, explaining the overwhelming presence of this plant&#x02019;s remains in the cave. La Perra&#x02019;s function may have been similar to the cycad harvesting camps of recent times we have documented in NEMX and Honduras (see below). In the Sierra de Tamaulipas, cycad harvesting culture lasted to the 1700s&#x000a0;AD when local indigenous groups were exterminated. Given cycad longevity, it is likely that the same populations and possibly some of the same plants were harvested continuously over this time frame.</p><p id="Par50">A question unanswerable until lithic or ceramic implements at La Perra are analyzed is whether or not the toxic starches of cycad seeds were processed for food, or whether the apparently innocuous sarcotestas alone were used (they still are processed into tortillas in other parts of NEMX at present, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) which would have required no specialized knowledge of toxin extraction by water leaching, sun-drying, boiling, or other methods.</p><p id="Par51">In the Valle de Tehuac&#x000e1;n, <italic>Dioon</italic> remains were found sparsely throughout the archaeobotanical record beginning around 6000&#x000a0;BP.

Extrapolating from our exhaustive Honduran research, we think it safe to assume fine-grained archival research elsewhere in MNCA where cycads have been prominent as staple foods and in religious contexts will yield similar results.</p><p id="Par58">We gathered oral historical accounts from Honduras, Oaxaca, and NEMX, and scattered records from elsewhere (marked as &#x0201c;formerly&#x0201d; in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Where cycads are still eaten and appreciated, oral histories typically recalled richer, more nuanced traditions and knowledge than those that persist today. Where cycads are no longer eaten but are still utilized for other purposes, particularly in Zapotec and Teenek contexts, cycad consumption often evoked distant shameful memories of dire poverty and lack of maize among elderly first-language speakers. Teenek interviewees who as children had been forced to gather and eat cycad seeds during famines in some instances terminated interviews with us or cried over the long-buried memories of the suffering associated with the practice. Though such reactions point to cycads as non-desirable &#x0201c;famine foods&#x0201d; rather than desirable staples for such cultures, we found simultaneously that adjacent ethnic groups did not feel this way at all. For example, mestizos and Xi&#x02019;iuy people who continue to harvest from the same cycad populations that Teenek informants were forced to harvest from in the 1940s perceive cycad foods as objects of pride and embodiments of local identity, with highly desirable tastes and textures: i.e., in exactly the opposite manner as the Teenek. The same can be said in Oaxaca, where Chinantec and to a lesser extent Mazatec speakers consume and value cycad foods at present, Chontal de Oaxaca value them as a maize food of the ancestors, while Zapotec people value them for religious reasons but excoriated them (in communities we visited) as famine foods.</p><p id="Par59">Across all MNCA cycad-eating regions, consumption has diminished considerably over the past century as modern transportation has brought communities closer to market centers and maize has become regularly and predictably available for purchase. In the post-World War II period, cycads and numerous other wild foods were all but abandoned. Even in areas where strong connections between cycads and maize continue to exist and cycad eating is not stigmatized (e.g., Nahua of N Hidalgo), consumption largely disappeared during the mid-twentieth century.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strategies of contemporary food processing</title><p id="Par60">Cycad food and drink preparation processes have been documented in detail from several countries outside the region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) (e.g., Dominican Republic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], Colombia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the USA (Florida) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]), but few non-Australian studies discuss components of harvesting, preparation, and consumption in any detail.

As a general rule, landowners eradicate MNCA cycads (even in areas where others harvest them traditionally, sometimes creating conflicts) if they interfere with land management strategies or out of disregard for them where they are perceived as having little or no value. However, most commonly in NEMX and Honduras, we confirmed that local people incorporate at least 26 species of cycads in traditional, intentional land management practices (exclusive of the sacred maize-cycad relationship, described in a later section). Agroecological management strategies may be for purely utilitarian reasons, typically evinced as the case in Honduras, or incorporate sacred dimensions, as among Teenek and Nahua in NEMX and among Chiapanec people in Chiapas. Reasons to manage cycads are focused on their food value and are specifically (1) to improve cone yields, (2) to mitigate damage to leaves from harvesters, (3) to balance cone production and maize production, where the two are intercropped, and (4) to balance with the needs of cattle.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption><p>Trunkless female <italic>chamal</italic> (<italic>Dioon edule</italic>) with mature cone just prior to harvesting, Pamer&#x000ed;a region, San Luis Potos&#x000ed;, 2009</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13002_2018_282_Fig13_HTML" id="MO13"/></fig><fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p>Male <italic>chamal</italic> (<italic>Dioon edule</italic>) with immature pollen cone, Pamer&#x000ed;a region, San Luis Potos&#x000ed;, 2009</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13002_2018_282_Fig14_HTML" id="MO14"/></fig><fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption><p>A <italic>chamalero</italic> demonstrates the process of splitting a <italic>chamal</italic> cone, extracting the seeds, and peeling away the sarcotesta, which is edible raw.

Terms such as <italic>finca</italic> (farm) and <italic>plantaci&#x000f3;n</italic> carry this connotation, distinguishing cycads from other harvested wild species not thought to have been planted by humans. Such cycad &#x0201c;farms&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;plantations&#x0201d; are usually treated as common-property resources even where found on private lands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">The principal intentional engagement of people with cycads in the landscape takes place in the context of the cone harvest. In most places today, cycad populations are accessible by road or by a day-trip on foot. Previously, when fewer roads existed, cycads were located up to several days on foot away from communities, and cycad gatherers, sometimes with their families, and occasionally entire villages, relocated to seasonal cycad-harvesting camps. Taller species, such as <italic>tiusinte</italic> in Honduras, have to be scaled to reach cones, a risky process that entails finding a foothold on the helpful notches carved into the trunks at some point in the past. While typically an activity performed by men, women also recounted harvesting cones in the past. Leaf crowns are typically partially removed to get at the cones, which are twisted off and then broken apart in situ, and the sarcotesta-covered seeds extracted, placed in sacks, often loaded onto beasts of burden, and taken back to permanent residences for processing as described above.</p><p id="Par74">In both NEMX and Honduras mestizo communities, a common belief is that in years that maize is abundant, cycad cones are not, and vice versa, showing the complementarity of the two resources even where the ritual compatibilities of cycads as maize ancestors have been forgotten. Desperately hungry families may destroy immature cones in their search for viable cycad food, resulting in a diminished harvest for others. As an attempt to control this behavior and make harvesting more equitable, municipal authorities in certain Honduran communities once enforced a seasonal ban on harvesting, and there have been recent attempts to restore the practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Local people with substantial agroecological knowledge recognize that cycads are very hardy, and that low-level fires stimulate leaf flushes. In certain locations, people also recognize that careless removal of leaves, particularly by machete, can damage the plants. Because cycads are so hardy and fire-tolerant, they are often the only plants to survive in burned-over maize fields after all other vegetation has been eliminated. In Honduras, maize and <italic>tiusinte</italic> cycads are intentionally intercropped and in a few cases leaves that shade out maize plants are selectively and carefully removed to avoid damage.</p><p id="Par76">Struggle often occurs between cattle ranchers and cycad harvesters. In Honduras, few interviews with cattle ranchers revealed any concern that <italic>tiusinte</italic> was poisonous to cattle to the extent that <italic>Dioon</italic> is in NEMX. Honduran ranchers simply destroy <italic>tiusinte</italic> as they do any woody plant that is not necessary in a pasture&#x02014;by repeated burning, cutting, and poisoning. Nevertheless, recent advances have been made in the Gualaco municipality to reverse this approach, for example through the collaboration of cycad biologists, agronomists, and biologists, and through public education and awareness at events such as cycad fairs (see <italic>tiusinte</italic>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In NEMX, <italic>enchamalamiento</italic> (cycad intoxication) caused widespread loss of stock, particularly from the effects of hind-leg ataxia. Governmental authorities in the past thus considered cycads to be noxious weeds, the &#x0201c;hierbas locas&#x0201d; (crazy weeds) reported by Reko [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], and stimulated campaigns to eliminate <italic>chamal</italic> from vast lowland areas. But in San Luis Potos&#x000ed; villages such as Gamotes and Agua Puerca, the two resources are rendered compatible in traditional land management regimes. In these communities, where <italic>chamal</italic> is still highly valued as a food resource among traditional Xi&#x02019;iuy and mestizo groups, cattle are penned up and thus not allowed to come into contact with <italic>chamal</italic> when new leaves flush, because it is said that the cattle tend to seek out the tender leaves and are poisoned as a result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">Other traditional practices across the region include occasional use of sarcotestas as well as detoxified seeds for domestic animal feed, preparation of a rodenticide from the raw seeds to control crop pests (primarily rats and mice), and use of leaves for thatch in the temporary field shelters erected by farmers.</p><p id="Par78">A final important practice in this category is cycad cultivation in home gardens. We documented the practice where it appeared to be traditional but did not include plants bought in commercial nurseries. Traditional reasons to grow cycads in home gardens, beyond their purely ornamental value, are for access to leaves for religious and secular ceremonies, and occasionally, for access to starch for food (though this presumes enough domestic male and female plants are present in a community to sustain the beetle pollinator population necessary for ensuring fertilization and maturation of female cones). In communities distant from cycad populations, where cycads are nonetheless highly valued, as is the case in Juticalpa, Honduras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], dozens of cycads exist in home gardens and often pre-date the houses themselves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limited and local traditional economic importance</title><p id="Par79">We found seven MNCA cycad species that played some role in the cash economy as a minor food commodity (&#x0201c;Economic uses&#x0201d; column, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). In local, traditional economic contexts, cycad seeds have been incorporated into local and occasionally regional market contexts. In areas with heaviest food usage, such as Gualaco, Honduras, cycad gatherers constitute a seasonal, itinerant, informal labor pool. Some men supplement their income by gathering and selling cycad seeds to households, and interviewees commonly mentioned that such <italic>tiusinteros</italic> utilized the income to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. Seeds also can be found in certain town markets, such as Olanchito in Honduras and in San Luis Potos&#x000ed; and Quer&#x000e9;taro. Food products are occasionally offered for sale as well&#x02014;for example, local Xi&#x02019;iuy people regularly sell <italic>tamales de chamal</italic> to mestizos in the central plaza of San Antonio Tancoyol, Quer&#x000e9;taro. We have not yet found recent evidence of cycad seeds or foods being sold in large regional markets distant from areas of traditional consumption. Leaves, though heavily utilized in religious ceremonies throughout the region, are not commonly offered for sale, and the leaf trade for local use, with the possible exception of the Tehuantepec region of southern Mexico, does not appear to have a significant effect on wild plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Non-religious decorative uses</title><p id="Par80">In traditional as well as commercial contexts, cycads are highly valued as ornamental plants in public and private landscapes, and native species are often mixed with Old World cycad species (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>, <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>, <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>) (see &#x0201c;Other uses&#x0201d; column, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Many MNCA communities where cycads are highly valued contain permanently transplanted cycads in public plazas and other highly visible locations. Otherwise, decorative uses not directly associated with religious ceremonies tend to involve transitional events. In NEMX, cycad leaves are commonly utilized to construct processional arches for wedding receptions and graduations, suggesting a connection to symbolic value as plants that help effect or ease transitions between life stages.

Nevertheless, what we encountered during field research bears brief mention. We often found that cycads&#x02014;whole plants or parts&#x02014;are extracted to be sold in local nurseries, and typically purchased by people from urban areas for purely decorative purposes. Whole plants and seeds are also trafficked illegally across international borders. In one of the most egregious cases we encountered, <italic>Dioon tomasellii</italic> populations, bereft of local ethnobotanical value, ownership, or even knowledge of traditional names or uses, are extracted wholesale by middlemen from the hills near the resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Local people in a rural village near a previously undocumented cycad population asked us point blank if we were interested in buying cycads, because they earn income by helping extract cycads for this illicit business. The cycads are transplanted to resort hotels in Puerto Vallarta. We found no evidence of government knowledge of or interference in the activity.

The latter believed that wild and particularly toxic foods such as cycads (among many others) were &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; and uncivilized and thus should not be used or eaten.

The pride in this important element of cultural heritage is widely apparent in the increasing amount of video evidence and commentary available online. Further study of such cycad pilgrimages is necessary to understand the deeper reasons for cycad use during a Catholic festival of relatively recent invention; we suggest that pilgrimages may have originated with Mesoamerican land fertility rituals given that early May is associated with maize field preparation prior to the onset of the first rains, particularly in southernmost Mexico and Central America.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Associations with palms</title><p id="Par90">Cycads are culturally associated&#x02014;in agroecological and ritual contexts&#x02014;with many other plant groups, ranging from <italic>Pseudobombax</italic> to <italic>Beaucarnea</italic>, <italic>Dasylirion</italic>, various ferns, and so forth. Most of these relationships, evident in local terms for cycads, have barely been explored (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The most significant association, with maize and its relatives, is discussed in the next section. We frequently encountered, and thus briefly highlight here, cycads&#x02019; confusing relationships with palms, with which they are often grouped&#x02014;both by indigenous people possessing extensive knowledge, and by casual observers confusing them due to their physical similarities.</p><p id="Par91">We found 32 distinct terms for MNCA cycads that related them to palms, by far the prevalent nomenclatural association with another plant, after maize. This profusion is most obviously related to the physical resemblances of palms and cycads and many such names may be of quite recent origin or idiosyncratic to individual interviewees. At a deeper level, though, some names reflect the interchangeability of cycads and palms in Roman Catholic religious events, whether for simple expediency or as continuations of pre-Christian uses of cycads at temples and other sacred sites. In essence, palms were sacred in both Old and New World cultures prior to contact between the two regions, while cycads were unknown to Spanish colonizers. After colonization, knowledges and traditions intertwined, thus making it difficult to say whether a specific cycad-palm connection such as a term or a use in a religious altar predates colonization or is of more recent derivation.</p><p id="Par92">The question of whether cycads are conceived as types of palms in MNCA Indigenous and Indigenous-derived cultures is highly contextual. For example, among the Otom&#x000ed;-&#x000d1;uhu, the Teenek, and certain Zapotec groups, cycads are in essence thought to be a type of palm (in some cases, cycads are even seen both as types of palm and as types of maize). Indigenous language nomenclature suggests that cycads-as-palms predates recent Roman Catholic influence. In Honduras, by contrast, we found that even while popular wisdom held that cycads were types of palms, knowledgeable users in areas with native cycad populations were typically insistent that cycads were not palms.</p><p id="Par93">The distinctions, or lack thereof, are highly significant for conservation, given that confusion between the two groups, if not based in deep cultural traditions, can be catastrophic when their differential growth rates are considered. This is best illustrated by frequent cases we encountered in Honduras, where uninformed recent in-migrants assuming cycads to be a type of fast-growing palm simply chopped down thousand-year-old cycads to get at the cones, just as they would local palm species harvested for their nuts. We have observed entire cycad populations razed to the ground in this way, under the assumption that they will grow tall again in a few years. By contrast, knowledgeable and aghast local people who showed us these cases were aware that female cycads can take 50 or more years just to produce a cone and begin to grow a stem.</p><p id="Par94">In the arid Xi&#x02019;iuy cultural zone of San Luis Potos&#x000ed; known as the Pamer&#x000ed;a, <italic>chamal</italic> is closely associated with the palm <italic>Brahea dulcis</italic>, which also has a variety of uses. Both plants are of considerable importance in local culture. The striking complementarity of the two species extends to a form of barter&#x02014;palm resources (leaves for thatch, for example) have long been exchanged for cycad seeds.

Nevertheless, numerous terms and concepts situate cycads as progenitors and protectors of maize among the Xi&#x02019;iuy, Teenek, and Nahua of NEMX and among the Chontal de Oaxaca.

In these definitions, people imbue places with positive meanings that accrue over time and that favor feelings of attachment, belonging, and harmony (or in some cases, neutral or negative associations such as detachment, lack of belonging, fear, etc.). Physical and biological features of landscapes such as mountains, rivers, caves, plants, and animals, are tangible contributors to sense of place.

However, considerations of religious significance and nomenclature aside, the greatest similarities in Honduran and Mexican cultural practices are between the <italic>tiusinte</italic> region and Xi&#x02019;iuy treatment of cycads rather than Teenek or Nahua treatment. It is difficult to believe such similarities could have arisen separately given that they involve identical detoxification practices (particularly ash-washing), cultural beliefs (what constitutes a good tamale), and other aspects of food preparation specific to the two cultures while distinct from anything in the intervening region. However, there is no record of Xi&#x02019;iuy people migrating to Honduras. The key to explaining this conundrum is the multicultural nature of the broader Huasteca region of NEMX through time. For many centuries, as they do today, Nahua, Teenek, and Xi&#x02019;iuy lived in close proximity and sometimes intermarried, thus explaining how a small number of mixed Nahua-Xi&#x02019;iuy families migrating to Honduras&#x02014;any time before the 1700s, when Mexican terms for cycads are first picked up in the historical record in Honduras, and after around 1000&#x02009;AD&#x02014;could have transported a limited but diverse suite of cultural beliefs and practices involving cycads and preserved it in an isolated part of Central America among an Indigenous culture that became known as <italic>Nahoa de Honduras</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], from which neighboring mestizos are also derived.</p><p id="Par118">Indeed, the Xi&#x02019;iuy and similar originally hunter gatherer groups whose ancestors used cycads heavily in the northeastern Mesoamerican frontier region of NEMX in association with maize are intriguing candidates for the ultimate origin of the maize-cycad relationship. However, given our lack of understanding of whether the spatial maize-cycad relationship over four millennia in strata excavated at La Perra reflected any meaningful sacred relationships between the two plants&#x02014;as we find today among the Nahua and Teenek&#x02014;or were simply coincidence, we cannot discard alternate possibilities. It is fully possible that the association originated outside of NEMX in places like Oaxaca, where it also exists, or even in WMX, for example in the maize-origin Balsas River drainage area of Guerrero where both <italic>Dioon stevensonii</italic> and <italic>Zamia paucijuga</italic> are still found.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref></p><p id="Par120">What are the agricultural benefits for the maintenance of cycads in <italic>milpas</italic> that would support a long-term association? Some avenues to explore include the nitrogen-fixing characteristics of cycads and other effects on the soil and rhizosphere that may make them ideal for strengthening and improving maize crops. It is certainly possible that proto-agriculturists sought out cycad populations to plant maize in for reasons such as this. The ultimate origins of and reasons for the maize-cycad belief system, and their connection to the original teosinte-as-grass region in Central America, remain fascinating questions to follow up on.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Threats to the continuance of ceremonial use</title><p id="Par121">As mentioned in the section on religion, above, sacred uses and knowledges of cycads are paramount for biocultural conservation strategies. When cycads are included in floral arrays, these frequently incorporate other plants of great religious importance such as <italic>sotol</italic> (<italic>Dasilyrion</italic> spp.) and <italic>cempasuchil</italic> (<italic>Tagetes erecta</italic>, marigold). In addition to the economic importance and effect on wild plants that such uses may have, it is important to note that the intricate practice of floral arranging is being eroded. Where reasons for incorporation of cycad leaves are forgotten or no longer deemed important, substitutes are found, such as plastic leaves for Honduran Day of the Dead wreathes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Floral arrangement practice at its most complex includes knowledge of wild populations as well as the preparation of a range of decorations, the placement of such decorations, and the function of the decorations in each ceremony. This knowledge is passed down through oral tradition via guild-like associations of participants. The dimensions of these traditions for cycads have not yet been studied through proper documentation (preferably via video and photography) that should occur during the events themselves. In almost all cases, we have been limited to observing decorations left up after events, asking interviewees how such events take place and how decorations are created. The connections between such ritual decorative uses, sacramental food, and other components noted in this article should be studied further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par122">We were greatly limited by the extremely fragmentary nature of published cycad ethnobotanical data prior to our work. Researchers with no prior knowledge of the unique importance of cycads in local culture have failed to ask important questions such as those about the roles of <italic>konlif</italic> in Teenek <italic>milpas</italic>. It is our experience that interviewees do not discuss plants of such importance casually and are more used to being asked about plants outsiders perceive, and the literature underscores, are the most important: first maize, second other crops, and third, wild plants, with least importance afforded those wild plants that available literature suggest are toxic and therefore of little importance.</p><p id="Par123">Another limitation for us was the growing realization that local people withhold or talk little about cycad knowledge because of its sacred, protected nature. This case is similar to accounts elsewhere in the world of numerous important plants, suggesting that a primary reason for cycads&#x02019; remaining unknown is such qualities, tied, we suspect, to their shamanistic uses as entheogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p><p id="Par124">Our archeological data are sparse because MNCA archeologists have not looked specifically for evidence of cycads using methods such as pollen or starch grain analysis&#x02014;indeed, no index of <italic>Dioon</italic> or <italic>Ceratozamia</italic> pollen or starch grains exists that could be employed, suggesting that cycad remains may have been overlooked in past excavations. Compare this to the greater Caribbean, where <italic>Zamia</italic> is considered to have been a staple since earliest human settlement, and archeobotanical remains of <italic>Zamia</italic> are typically prominent in the archeological record e.g.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The same should be the case for numerous MNCA cycads.</p><p id="Par125">More than anything, we were limited by the vast geographical scope of the research, and biased toward areas most easily accessible to our research institutions. Given the fragmentary knowledge of this field of inquiry prior to the onset of our research, we were eventually able to develop adequate questionnaires (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) as we gained field experience learning of many beliefs about and uses of cycads that had never been recorded previously. This was additionally challenging because cycads have been incompletely surveyed, particularly in WMX and Oaxaca, where prominent populations of <italic>Dioon</italic> and <italic>Ceratozamia</italic> have still not been taxonomically treated by botanists.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref></p><p id="Par127">Overall, it can safely be said that our study only delved into cycad ethnobotany in depth in Honduras and among the Teenek, Nahua, and certain mestizo communities of NEMX, while Xi&#x02019;iuy cycad ethnobotany has been adequately investigated by others. Otherwise, extensive work remains to be done for numerous other ethnic groups we are aware of that possess ethnobotanical knowledge of cycads.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par128">While we have advanced considerably in providing at least partial answers to our research questions, let us examine whether our research to date has allowed us to confirm our hypotheses. In terms of food, we can state that while they were clearly once important, cycads have lost enormous value across MNCA except in isolated areas, and even in those areas, food use is diminishing as knowledge of detoxification procedures are lost and former consumers turn to easier-to-prepare and less toxic food sources. Nevertheless, long-term neurotoxic effects indeed have not been an issue, as we suspected. However, we recommend controlled studies of cycad-consuming populations to completely rule this out, and to test for potential long-term negative health effects of other types (e.g., on the liver) as well as for positive effects, given that we know very little about the nutritional value of cycads apart from the carbohydrate content.</p><p id="Par129">The use of cycads in religion appears to be the primary reason people are aware of the plants and appreciative of their values in the vast amount of cases where cycads are not eaten. In terms of incorporation into religious ceremonies, our data do not indicate any increasing or decreasing trends, but they definitely show the centrality of cycads in a range of practices the extent and significance of which have barely been studied. We should also point out that whether or not they are perceived as palms, cycads are specifically sought out for their intrinsic qualities and imbued highly distinct meanings as cycads, with both positive and negative effects on wild populations.</p><p id="Par130">We additionally hypothesized that awareness of how cycads contribute to sense of place and cultural identity could in turn stimulate traditional protection measures designed to help preserve cycads. This was obviously borne out in the cited cases of <italic>tiusinte</italic> in Honduras and Chiapanec pilgrimages, as well as in manifestations of the cycad-maize relationship in NEMX. Overall, though, despite a few cases to the contrary, we were vindicated in our claim that cycad ethnobotanical knowledge, uses, and traditional protection measures are being rapidly eroded across the entire region. We hope that this article will contribute to a reversal of the trend.</p><p id="Par131">We have uncovered an obvious connection between importance of cycads to local culture and how local cultures treat wild populations, and this is key to converting the findings in this study to useful elements of community-based conservation. Cultures that value cycads to a great extent appear to be more likely to avoid eliminating them in the wild, but as such appreciation fades, cycads come to be ignored and are left to be eradicated. But even the worst cases, such as the wholesale destruction of cycads for cattle pasture, have counter examples such as the co-management of cattle and cycads in the Pamer&#x000ed;a region and the contemporary focus in the Honduran <italic>tiusinte</italic> region on creating compatibility between cycads and cattle ranchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Numerous other elements of cycad ethnobotanical knowledge and practice exist that should be publicized and interpreted in collaboration with communities, as has already been done with <italic>Dioon merolae</italic> in Chiapas and <italic>Dioon mejiae</italic> in Honduras. While cycads can become sustainable trade items for purely decorative reasons that put money in harvesters&#x02019; and growers&#x02019; pockets, we suggest that it is most likely they will be protected in situ by local people in the long run if the incentive for their protection is as key elements in the preservation of local identities, traditions, cultural heritage, and sense of place. These, after all, not pecuniary motives, are the reasons they have been protected and valued already for millennia.</p><p id="Par132">Models of community-based cycad conservation also have validity beyond MNCA, given the commonalities found among human-cycad relationships around the world. This study is intended to inspire similar efforts elsewhere as a step toward new approaches to cycad conservation that, where possible, are able to draw on old and even discarded beliefs and traditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec32"><p>
