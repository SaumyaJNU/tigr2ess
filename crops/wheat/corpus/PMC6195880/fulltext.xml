The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of ferulate against the oxidative stress-induced imbalance of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), in connection with our previous finding that oxidative stress-induced imbalance of PTKs and PTPs is linked with proinflammatory nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation. To test the effects of ferulate on this process, we utilized two oxidative stress-induced inflammatory models. First, YPEN-1 cells were pretreated with ferulate for 1 hr prior to the administration of 2,2&#x02032;-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH). Second, 20-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ferulate for 10 days. After ferulate treatment, the activities of PTKs, PTPs, and PP2A were measured because these proteins either directly or indirectly promote NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Our results revealed that in YPEN-1 cells, ferulate effectively suppressed AAPH-induced increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NF-&#x003ba;B activity, as well as AAPH-induced PTK activation. Furthermore, ferulate also inhibited AAPH-induced PTP and PP2A inactivation. In the aged kidney model, ferulate suppressed aging-induced activation of PTKs and ameliorated aging-induced inactivation of PTPs and PP2A. Thus, herein we demonstrated that ferulate could modulate PTK/PTP balance against oxidative stress-induced inactivation of PTPs and PP2A, which is closely linked with NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Based on these results, the ability of ferulate to modulate oxidative stress-related inflammatory processes is established, which suggests that this compound could act as a novel therapeutic agent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ferulate</kwd><kwd>Wheat germ</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>PTK</kwd><kwd>PTP</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ferulate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid) is a well-known phytochemical that has been widely used in maintaining good health and nutrition (<xref rid="b1-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and has been reported to exert beneficial effects, such as lowering blood glucose levels, diminishing cerebral ischemic injury, and promoting anti-tumor activity (<xref rid="b2-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Other reports have shown that ferulate has the potential ability to treat various abnormal conditions, including cancer, arthritis, and aging (<xref rid="b5-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Research continues to investigate ferulate and acquire additional evidence of its powerful activities. Ferulate has been shown to reduce LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; expression (<xref rid="b8-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), modulate IL-6 expression (<xref rid="b9-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and attenuate the inflammatory release of NALP3 (<xref rid="b10-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These promising outcomes of ferulate originate from its strong antioxidant activity, which was shown to affect the regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) (<xref rid="b11-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>During inflammation, NF-&#x003ba;B plays a critical role in regulating proinflammatory gene expression (<xref rid="b12-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is an inducible dimeric transcription factor that is comprised of Rel family proteins that bind a consensus sequence motif and is found in all cell types (<xref rid="b13-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B activation is involved in a wide variety of gene expression patterns in response to infection, inflammation, inflammatory disease, cancer, and senescence (<xref rid="b14-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is also a well-established redox-sensitive transcription factor that is tightly regulated by redox changes (<xref rid="b15-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with the cysteine residues of redox-sensitive signaling molecules, such as transcription factors, protein tyrosine phosphatases, and protein kinases; thus, oxidation of thiol groups on these residues can lead to modifications of the target proteins&#x02019; biological activities, signaling capacities, immune responses, and additional cell live/dead paradigms (<xref rid="b16-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>As a part of redox biology, cellular signaling is involved in redox-regulated control of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Moreover, balancing the activation and inhibition of the reversible oxidation of the active sites on these proteins has emerged as a critical sensor of the redox state (<xref rid="b17-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins is a key regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic physiology that is catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases (<xref rid="b18-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Accumulating evidence from cell and animal models has demonstrated PTP oxidation in models of common diseases, such as cancer, metabolic/cardiovascular disease, immune dysfunction, and age-related diseases (<xref rid="b18-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, the activation status of the PTK Src as well as that of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B are decisive criteria for the onset of cancer (<xref rid="b20-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, NF-&#x003ba;B and the expression of its downstream effector genes are also affected by the imbalance of PTKs and PTPs, which was deemed to be the cause of numerous diseases in humans (<xref rid="b16-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b21-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In addition to limiting tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, PTKs and PTPs affect serine/threonine phosphorylation by modulating the activities of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) (<xref rid="b22-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the PP family, serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been reported to be closely linked with NF-&#x003ba;B activation; thus, PP2A is now considered a potential therapeutic target of inflammatory diseases and cancer (<xref rid="b23-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Some reports have provided evidence that inhibition of pan-tyrosine phosphatase activity by orthovanadate translates to inhibition of PP2A, which would result in the upregulation of cellular physiological responses and proinflammatory genes via NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref rid="b20-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b22-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Based on these reports, ferulate could be a promising agent for treating NF-&#x003ba;B-related diseases. Despite the status of ferulate as a therapeutic agent against inflammatory diseases, cancer, and aging, the effects of ferulate on the regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted the present study to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effect (if any) of ferulate using a rat endothelial cell line and aged rat kidneys.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>2,2&#x02032;-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit, and the BCA protein reagent were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA).

AAPH was used to generate oxidative stress to simulate aging-related conditions in a cell culture model (<xref rid="b16-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The capacity of ferulate to either eliminate or inhibit the production of intracellular ROS was investigated using DCFDA. Furthermore, this study sought to determine the activity of ferulate on the ROS-related, redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B. The results show that ferulate effectively suppressed AAPH-induced ROS levels (<xref rid="f2-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B activity (<xref rid="f2-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulatory effect of ferulate on AAPH-induced PTK/PTP imbalance</title><p>To clarify the effect of ferulate on the AAPH-induced imbalance of PTKs and PTPs activity, we measured the activity of PTKs and PTPs in YPEN-1 cells. Ferulate suppressed AAPH-induced activation of PTK (<xref rid="f3-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and restored AAPH-induced inactivation of PTP (<xref rid="f3-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which led to the modulation of the PTK/PTP balance (<xref rid="f3-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the total activity of PP.

We aimed to identify the phosphorylation site on PP2A in AAPH-treated YPEN-1 cells because phosphorylation of Tyr307 on the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) causes PP2A inactivation (<xref rid="b24-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f4-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, ferulate suppressed AAPH-induced phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr307, but there was no change in total PP2Ac expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Suppressive effects of dietary ferulate on the PTK/PTP ratio and PP activity in kidneys from aged rats</title><p>We explored the effect of ferulate on the PTK and PTP activity in kidney homogenates from aged rats.

As shown in <xref rid="f5-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, ferulate suppressed aging-induced activation of PTK and recovered aging-induced inactivation of PTP, both of which resulted in the modulation of the PTK/PTP equilibrium.</p><p>We also determined the total activity of PP in the kidney homogenates from aged rats. As shown in <xref rid="f6-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, compared with the activity observed in young rat kidneys, total PP activity was significantly reduced in aged rat kidneys, but kidneys from ferulate-fed aged rats had PP activity that increased in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, ferulate suppressed aging-induced PP2Ac phosphorylation (Tyr307) in aged rat kidneys; however, there was no change in total PP2Ac expression (<xref rid="f6-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that ferulate ameliorates age-related oxidative stress-induced PTK/PTP and PP2A inactivation through its antioxidant action. These findings suggest that ferulate could be a regulator of not only cellular redox imbalance but also of PTK/PTP equilibrium.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ferulate is present in whole-grain wheat, wheat bran, and wheat germ (<xref rid="b25-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and has been reported to be the major metabolite of hydroxycinnamates (e. g., ferulate, sinapate, p-coumarate, and caffeate) and diferulates (<xref rid="b26-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

Some recent reports describe the activity of ferulate in attenuating acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice (<xref rid="b28-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), ameliorating trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced ulcerative colitis in rats (<xref rid="b29-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), preventing LPS-induced upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activity, assembly of thick bundles of actin filaments (suggesting a potential intervention of neuroinflammatory diseases in the neuroblast cell line PC12) (<xref rid="b30-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and protecting PK11195-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and cell death in SH-Y5Y neuroblastoma cells (<xref rid="b31-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, these studies highlight the beneficial effects of ferulate in exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>Owing to the antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds, it is likely that they play a role in protecting the body against oxidative stress and the subsequent effects. In fact, phenolic compounds in grains directly mitigate oxidative stress by increasing the antioxidant capacity in the blood or indirectly via cell signaling (<xref rid="b32-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effects of ferulate on oxidative stress-related NF-&#x003ba;B activation. AAPH-treated YPEN-1 cells and aged rat kidneys were prepared as models of oxidative stress-induced inflammation, and we administered ferulate to these models to acquire more evidence of the properties of ferulate. NF-&#x003ba;B activation can occur via several redox-related signaling pathways. Two examples are: IKK &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-dependent I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and degradation, which is activated by its upstream MEKKK family NIK (<xref rid="b34-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b35-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and MAPKs that induce nuclear translocation, such as ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK, which are activated by their upstream MEKK (<xref rid="b36-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>During the aging process, ROS are produced in large quantities because of increased inflammatory reactions. In our previous study, we described a possible mechanism of ROS-induced PTP inhibition and PTK activation via the inflammatory process during aging (<xref rid="b16-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b22-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As depicted in <xref rid="f1-tr-34-333" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the perturbed balance of PTK/PTP by ROS affected the inactivation of PP2A, which led to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B-related serine/threonine kinases, such as NIK/IKKalpha/beta and MAPKs. Therefore, decreases in PP2A activity either directly or indirectly modulate NF-&#x003ba;B activity. In the present study, inactivation of PP2A by ROS or aging was closely correlated with phosphorylation of Tyr307 on the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac), which is consistent with the increase in PTK activity induced by ROS or aging in conjunction with reduced PTP activity. As an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory phenolic compound, ferulate exerted an inhibitory role against PTK and PP2A in the present study. Interestingly, this activity was potent and non-toxic, yet not specific. Additionally, these inhibitory regulations were deemed consistent with the predicted inhibitory activity against NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Ferulate is a low toxicity compound, with LD<sub>50</sub> values of 2,445 mg/kg and 2,113 mg/kg in male and female rats, respectively (<xref rid="b37-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Choi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref rid="b38-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) found that a ferulate treatment up to 1.54 mM did not show any toxicity on NIH-3T3, HepG2, or 3T3-L1 cells. Additionally, 5.1 mM ferulate treatment for 7 days did not exhibit toxicity on human bone marrow stromal cells (<xref rid="b39-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In addition, our previous study found that 200 &#x003bc;M ferulate inhibited t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity on YPEN-1 cell (<xref rid="b11-tr-34-333" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, we have not noticed any adverse reactions in this study. Therefore, ferulate does not seem to have toxic effects on YPEN-1 cells and aged rats.</p><p>In conclusion, the modulatory function of ferulate against proinflammatory NF-&#x003ba;B signaling was demonstrated, and the predicted underlying mechanisms were investigated in this study. The data indicated that ferulate modulated the PTK/PTP balance against oxidative stress-exacerbated inactivation of PTP and PP2A, both of which are directly involved in NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the AAPH-induced cell model and aged rats. Thus, our study supports a novel mode of action of ferulate in the oxidative stress-related inflammatory process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Korean government, Small and Medium Business Administration (Project No. C0355276), of the Republic of Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn2-tr-34-333" fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold>
