Integrated management where biocontrol plays an important role has been suggested in order to fight FHB. <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> A26 is known to be an effective antagonist against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Deeper understanding of the mode of action of <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> A26 is needed to develop strategies for its application under natural settings in order to effectively overcome the pathogenic effects. This study aims to re-evaluate a former study and reveal whether compounds other than non-ribosomal antibiotic lipopeptides could be responsible for the antagonistic effect, despite what is often reported. Wheat seedlings were grown to maturity and the spikes infected with the pathogen under greenhouse conditions.

The disease severity is predicted to increase in various regions owning to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. FHB is of particular concern because many of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> species produce mycotoxins that contaminate infected grain and may pose a serious threat to human and domestic animal health. Grain that has been infected with the fungus may become incorporated into our staple diets. For these reasons the antifungal activity of biocontrol agents against FHB pathogens has been extensively studied and several mechanisms suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3"><italic>Paenibacillus polymyxa</italic> is known as an FHB biocontrol agent. It is generally recognised that surface-associated bacteria colonise as biofilms, which are microniches entirely different from their surroundings. This allows the bacteria to work as a functional unit, accomplishing tasks not possible for their planktonic state. Biofilms consist of cells and matrices where complex exopolysaccharides and proteins are major components, and they can provide an important bacterial survival strategy in natural systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> biocontrol ability is often linked to the large bacterial pool of bioactive compounds such as nonribosomal peptides/polyketides (NRPs/PKs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Despite enormous diversity the compounds have common regulatory systems, as they are produced nonribosomally and require activation by phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTase) of which Sfp-type PPTase is required for activation of peptidyl and acyl carrier domains. The broad range of activities of NRPs and PKs includes promotion of adaptation to unfavourable environments. The <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> A26 strain was isolated from the Evolution Canyon, South Facing Slope, Israel (EC SFS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and has co-evolved with wild progenitors of cereals over a long period of time, helping host plants to adapt and survive under diverse harsh conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The genome analysis reveals regions that reflect these adaptations and the isolate is a superior plant growth promoting bacterium (PGPB) compared to isolates from more moderate environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In order to study the performance of the isolate we inactivated its Sfp-type PPTase gene and created a mutant that is incapable of producing enzymatically active 4&#x02032;-phosphopantetheinyl transferase. This in turn results in a strain lacking enzymatically active NRPs and PKs (A26&#x02206;sfp), and the nonribosomal peptide and polyketides, often reported as active metabolites for the biocontrol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, are not produced.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Evolution Canyon (EC) model.

While A26 antagonizes effectively at both low (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) and high (10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml) densities of inocula used in the study, A26&#x02206;sfp <italic>F. graminearum</italic> antagonism at 10<sup>8</sup> inoculum density leads to up to 25% improved antagonistic ability, reaching the ability of the wild type to antagonize <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). At the same time, 10<sup>3</sup> bacteria of both bacterial strains at both inoculum densities were recovered from the wheat heads one week after inoculation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It is commonly known that even though bacteria are crucial for biofilm formation, their measurement is insufficient to quantify biofilms. The EPS which form the major part of the microbial biofilm matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> were detected in the spike biofilm water solutions. The A26 biofilm contains 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g and A26 Sfp 1.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of EPS per ml (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The significant increase in the mutant biofilm matrix production is in accordance with our former findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Owing to the huge complexity of EPS matrix components, their detailed quantification is a challenge. D-glucuronate (D-GA) has previously been suggested as a proxy for biofilm comprehensive screening and uronic acid is widely determined as representative of myco-polysaccharides in biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The assay is based on the effectiveness of chemical bond disruption and digestion of polysaccharides into component monosaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Significant differences were detected in A26&#x02206;sfp D-GA at the two inoculum densities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The D-GA comprised 6% of EPS at the 10<sup>8</sup> inoculum density in comparison to 3.5% at the 10<sup>6</sup> inoculum density (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The result correlates well with the ability of the mutant to antagonize <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (r &#x0003e; 0.78, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The EPS titre and its D-GA content in the native biofilm layers of the control plant spikes and of the spikes prior to A26 or A26Sfp treatment were evaluated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It is interesting to note that all the native biofilms on control spikes, similar to A26Sfp high inocula biofilms, comprised around 6% D-GA. In order to further investigate the role of uronates, two commercially available reference polymers levan and alginic acid were used. Both EPS components can be found in <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> The commercial sugars contrast in D-GA content (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Levan is a polymer of fructose while alginate is comprised of uronates. While the alginate treatment fully antagonized the pathogen, fungal overgrowth was observed in the case of the levan treatment. The results further confirm the role of uronates regarding the antagonistic effect against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p><p id="Par28">How do we reconcile the outcome that 100 times initial inoculum density differences result in significant increases in the D-GA production of A26&#x02206;sfp? The interesting phenomenon that differences in initial inoculum density can lead to variable metabolism that cannot be linked to the inocula growth stage, has been reported earlier by Jeon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> GBR-1 <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-amylase gene was expressed only at a high inoculum density (10<sup>8</sup> per ml). The gene was not expressed with the low density inoculum (10<sup>6</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This phenomenon is certainly connected with complex biofilm biology and requires further study using parallel sequencing and high-resolution microscopy. However, even though the D-GA composition of the EPS matrix varies between the A26 and A26&#x02206;sfp strains, their isolated EPS, applied in surplus, induce resistance to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in the wheat kernel assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">It is widely recognised that uronic acid moieties affect the physiological and biological properties of polysaccharides. The uronates with high content of EPS, e.g. alginate and xanthan, result in increased water holding capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> It is believed that uronic acid backbones lead to changes in other sugar backbones, which eventually will result in alteration of their properties and bioactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. It is well known that EPS biosynthesis generally involves a very sophisticated network dependent on complex factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. EPS are combinations of monomers and polymers consisting of sugar compounds connected via glyosidic linkages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. EPS length, composition and formation vary considerably<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The main factors that influence EPS interactions include the charges, polymer functional groups, backbone and chain fitness, and the relative concentrations of the constituents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Hence EPS are not random co-polymers but vary and occur in combinations dependent on the various C and N sources used for bacterial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We were interested in the fragment length of the EPS in A26 and A26&#x02206;sfp wheat head biofilms. The analyses demonstrated that in biofilms from both the strains, the primary compounds were monomers (176&#x02009;Da), dimers (352&#x02009;Da), trimers (528&#x02009;Da) and tetramers (704&#x02009;Da). There were no significant quantities of oligomers larger than tetramers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Typical examples of mass spectra recorded for diverse fractions of <italic>Paenibacillus polymyxa</italic> A26 and A26&#x02206;sfp wheat spike biofilms at low and high inoculum densities.

It has been suggested that the ecological &#x02018;success&#x02019; of EPS depends on their potential to favorably influence the microorganisms&#x02019; adaptation to the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The EPS matrix serves as the microbial interface with the environment. In addition to environmental adaptation, EPS are also used for social skills communication, compartmentalization, competence and defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As the production of EPS requires copious amounts of energy, their regulatory control is important and there are many levels of EPS synthesis. Different subpopulations of <italic>eps</italic>- producing genes are activated during the different stages of biofilm development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Several EPS molecules have high WHC which can be even as high as 15 times their weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. WHC water accumulation can protect against water stress and was suggested by us as a mechanism of the drought tolerance enhancement of EC, SFS rhizobacterial strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The strains from the <italic>Hordeum spontaneum</italic> rhizosphere are likely to have machinery contributing to the wild cereal progenitors&#x02019; adaptation to the unfavorable environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to the alleviation of plant drought stress, the strain WHC contributes to nutrient availability, maintaining water potential and physiological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In our experiment the D-GA-containing EPS layer with high WHC could provide a physical barrier against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> pathogens. UHPLC-ESI-MS fragment assessments of the wheat head biofilm EPS after inoculation with A26 or A26Sfp at low and high inoculum densities showed that all biofilm EPS contain the mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramer fragment mixture (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Yet it is hard to speculate which types of D-GA-containing EPS were produced by the bacterial strains in the assay. It is clear that both A26&#x02206;sfp and A26 EPS are capable of absorbing water. The study in which sand was mixed with the biopolymers showed that A26&#x02206;sfp and A26 EPS have high WHC, which is similar to sodium alginate WHC (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). It is interesting to note that the treatment with the commercial low titre (15&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml<sup>1</sup>) reference substrate alginate resulted in protection against the pathogen in the model system. The result supports the idea that a biocontrol agent EPS matrix with high WHC is one of the critical factors providing a mechanism against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> pathogens. Several research groups have considered the strategy of application of pure EPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The work has mostly not resulted in consistent results owing to the complexity of the physical and chemical conditions of the natural environments as well as to the presence of native microbial communities which metabolize the EPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. On the other hand, it is possible to engineer the EPS production of the native biofilm formers via the nutrient supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par31">Here we present a study where the initial observations of the antagonism of the <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> A26 biofilm to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in the kernel assay are examined at a coarser scale in the greenhouse, and at a finer scale in experiments with commercial EPS application.

Previous studies have shown that the multifaceted information about the bacterial biofilm cannot simply be adopted from studies of their domesticated strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is possible that the A26 uronate-containing EPS matrix is required for efficient antagonism in the cases where the more common mechanisms of antagonism with antibiotic lipopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> are not available (as with A26&#x02206;sfp).

How much the EPS produced by wild type <italic>P. polymyxa</italic> A26 contribute to its <italic>F. graminearum</italic> antagonism under different environmental conditions remains to be elucidated.
