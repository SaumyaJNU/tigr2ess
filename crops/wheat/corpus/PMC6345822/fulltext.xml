However, cell culture-based expression of monoclonal IgG is costly and time-consuming, making this process difficult to use for high-throughput screening in early-stage evaluation of biologics. With the goal of establishing a fast, simple, and robust high-throughput expression system for IgG, we implemented the synthesis of functional aglycosylated IgG by constructive approach based on a reconstituted prokaryotic cell-free protein synthesis system (PURE system). Optimization of the PURE system revealed that the following factors and reaction conditions were needed for IgG synthesis: (1) inclusion of the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, (2) adjustment of the GSH/GSSG ratio, (3) inclusion of the molecular chaperone DnaK and its cofactors, and (4) use of an extended incubation time. Synthesis temperature and template DNA ratio (light chain-/heavy chain-encoding) also had been optimized for each IgG. Under optimal conditions, peak production of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab reached 124&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL. Furthermore, the active forms of other IgGs, including IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses, also were synthesized. These results provide basic information for the development of novel high-throughput expression and functional screening systems for IgG, as well as useful information for understanding the IgG synthesis process.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is an indispensable experimental tool in current basic biology research, where this molecule is used for its specific binding ability and high affinity for antigens. Concomitantly, monoclonal IgGs continue to attract attention as a dominant therapeutic protein for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases in the global biopharmaceutical market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. IgG is a large, complex, Y-shaped heterotetrameric protein consisting of two identical light chains (LCs) and two identical heavy chains (HCs) connected by disulfide bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Each chain is organized in multiple Ig domains, which can be categorized in turn into variable (VL, VH) and constant (CL, CH1, CH2, CH3) domains. In mammalian B cells or plasma cells, both LC and HC are co-translationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and form a whole IgG via a multiple-step folding and subunit assembly process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The complicated folding of IgG and associated quality control processes are assisted by ER proteins such as the ER chaperone BiP, peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> isomerase (PPIase), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and their cofactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Due to the complexity of IgG synthesis, various well-established mammalian cell culture systems (such as murine hybridoma, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and HEK293 cells) have been employed for the development and production of monoclonal IgG, from the laboratory scale to the industrial scale. Cell culture-based systems, however, include multiple steps, and can require intervals ranging from several days to several months to obtain cells transiently or stably expressing recombinant monoclonal IgG, rendering these processes costly and time-consuming, especially for high-throughput expression. These challenges represent bottlenecks in the early stages of development of therapeutic antibodies. One solution has been the high-throughput expression and functional screening of monoclonal antibodies using cell-free protein synthesis platforms. Antibody fragments such as single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and fragment antigen-binding (Fab) can be synthesized with cell lysate-based cell-free systems derived from wheat germ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, insect cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the past decade, several reports have described the synthesis of whole IgG using cell lysate-based cell-free systems derived from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, plant cell culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, or CHO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, Groff <italic>et al</italic>. reported the synthesis of aglycosylated IgG at gram-per-liter scale by using an improved <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> S30 extract-based system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The cell lysate-based cell-free system is relatively cost- and time-effective and scalable for the purpose of expression of monoclonal IgG compared to mammalian cell culture. However, because unpurified cell lysate is used for the system, the reaction mixture contains cell-derived components with concentrations varying by lysate preparation conditions and cellular source. The lysate includes not only substances related to protein synthesis but also organelles (e.g., ER reformed as microsomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>), interfering substances (e.g., nucleases, proteases, and other degradative and metabolic enzymes), and unintended protein synthesis-promoting factors (e.g., chaperones and unknown protein-folding and -stabilizing factors). This crude background impedes the establishment of more-robust, high-throughput expression and simpler functional screening systems for the following reasons: (1) It is difficult to identify substances that interfere with IgG synthesis for selective inhibition or removal from the mixture. (2) Since the crude background may interfere with the subsequent functional analyses such as binding kinetics and cell-based assays, a process for high-level purification of the synthesized product is essential. Therefore, identification of the minimal factors essential for cell-free synthesis of IgG is expected to permit the establishment of a simple and robust expression system, facilitating further improvement of the system while also potentially permitting functional screening of the products even in the absence of purification. Thus, a constructive &#x0201c;bottom-up&#x0201d; approach, depending on systematic assembly of the synthetic components (rather than generating a lysate by breaking down from the cell), is expected to be useful.</p><p id="Par5">The PURE (Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements) system is a reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system based on the protein synthesis machinery of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Unlike the cell lysate-based system, the PURE system contains only purified factors involved in transcription, translation, and energy regeneration. In the PURE system, the number of cell-derived contaminants is greatly decreased; reagent composition and reaction conditions can be readily adjusted. Thus, the PURE system is expected to be useful for evaluating protein synthesis and subsequent folding reactions under conditions that exclude the influence of contaminants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, facilitating functional analysis of the synthesized protein even in the absence of purification.</p><p id="Par6">Therefore, in the present study, we attempted the synthesis of whole IgG by the addition of minimal factors to the PURE system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), permitting the definition of the minimal additional factors and the optimum reaction conditions for the synthesis of functional aglycosylated IgGs. Several IgGs, including IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses, also were synthesized in a limited number of steps using the optimized PURE system; the binding activities of these products were confirmed even without purification. Our results provide valuable information regarding the IgG synthesis process, and a useful basis for further engineering of the IgG synthesis process. Therefore, our results indicate the applicability of the constructive approach, based on the PURE system, for establishing simple and robust high-throughput expression and functional screening of antibodies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>IgG synthesis with the standard PURE system.

The well-known anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> was selected as a model IgG for the optimization of synthesis conditions. Since the PURE system does not contain nuclease activity, linear (e.g., PCR product) or circular DNA can be used as the expression template. Therefore, LC- and HC-encoding template DNAs were constructed in a T7 promoter-driven PCR product format (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As a first step, we tested whether IgG can be synthesized with the standard PURE system with only basic protein translation function. <italic>LC</italic> and <italic>HC</italic> template DNAs were simultaneously added to a total of 10&#x02009;nM of the mixed PCR products (molar ratio of <italic>LC</italic>:<italic>HC</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1:1) to the PURE system and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 16&#x02009;hours. After centrifugation, the reaction mixture was subjected to reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE following by detection and quantitation in the gel by staining with fluorescent dye (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As shown in reducing SDS-PAGE, both LC (23.6&#x02009;kDa) and HC (50.6&#x02009;kDa) were synthesized (to 166&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL and 116&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL, respectively) using the standard PURE system without optimization. However, all of the synthesized LC and HC were pelleted by centrifugation (lane &#x0201c;pellet&#x0201d;); notably, whole IgG (148.3&#x02009;kDa) was not observed on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (lane &#x0201c;sup&#x0201d;). This result indicated that the synthesized LC and HC needed to be solubilized to permit assembly of whole IgG. Therefore, the improvement of IgG synthesis by constructive approach based on the PURE system was attempted, as follows.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Improvement of solubility and formation of disulfide bonds</title><p id="Par8">In separate work (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), we showed that Fab and scFv derived from trastuzumab could be synthesized in soluble and active forms by adding a molecular chaperone DnaK and its cofactors (DnaK mix) and a disulfide bond isomerase DsbC to the reaction mixture. Therefore, enhancement of IgG synthesis with the PURE system was attempted here using the same approach. First, DnaK mix was added to the PURE system to improve the solubility of LC and HC.

Thus, oxidation of DTT by GSSG is almost irreversible due to imbalanced equilibrium under the condition described here. TCEP, a water-soluble trialkylphosphine, is an irreversible strong reducing agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The DTT and TCEP results suggest that maintaining the proper thiol-disulfide equilibrium state between reducing and oxidizing agents in the presence of DsbC is necessary for IgG formation.</p><p id="Par29">The IgG formation efficiency of the tested IgGs was far from 100% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The first cause of this result is the imbalance of the amount of the synthesized products of HC and LC molecules, presumably due to unstable CDR sequences. For example, in trastuzumab which has the highest IgG formation efficiency among IgG1 members in this experiment, the synthesized LC and HC molecules were approximately 1:1 at the maximum yield of IgG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e,f</xref>). However, in adalimumab and cetuximab, the synthesized LC and HC molecules were not 1:1 at the maximum yield of IgG (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Since the presence of excess HC or LC molecules reduces IgG formation efficiency, it will be necessary to optimize the ratio and to stabilize the HC or LC molecules by optimizing the CDR sequences. As a second, since control of intermolecular disulfide bonding is very difficult <italic>in vitro</italic>, undesirable byproducts such as HC and LC monomer, dimer, HC<sub>2</sub>-LC trimer and nonspecific disulfide-bonded polymer are simultaneously formed with whole IgG. Moreover, the assembly of LCs and HCs into the heterotetramer required extended incubation (28&#x02009;hours). In order to improve IgG formation efficiency and accelerate IgG formation more, addition of other factors to the optimized PURE system would be needed. Feige <italic>et al</italic>. have summarized the folding mechanism of IgGs, categorizing the folding of each Ig domain into three categories based on the folding process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In all categories, prolyl <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> isomerization is commonly the rate-limiting step. Indeed, several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that the folding of the Ig domain is accelerated in the presence of PPIase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, the simultaneous addition of 1&#x000d7;&#x02009;DnaK mix and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> PPIase FkpA to the PURE system did not accelerate IgG formation in our experiments, instead lowering the yield (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Nonetheless, addition of other <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> PPIases (e.g., trigger factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>) or eukaryotic PPIases to the optimized PURE system may still further accelerate IgG formation and improve IgG formation efficiency. On the other hand, it has been reported that initial disulfide bond formation facilitates the establishment of a folding nucleus for the Ig domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Similarly, Sato <italic>et al</italic>. reported that PDI family proteins ERp46 and P5 act in concert with PDI to accelerate disulfide bond formation in the mammalian ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Those authors hypothesized that ERp46 and P5 rapidly and indiscriminately introduce non-native disulfide bonds to the nascent polypeptide chain while translocating the chain into the ER, and PDI proofreads the disulfide bond to ensure the formation of the correct links. Similarly, the prokaryotic DsbA protein has been predicted to introduce disulfide bonds acting in cooperation with DsbC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, addition of P5 or DsbA to the optimized PURE system also may accelerate IgG formation and improve IgG formation efficiency.</p><p id="Par30">In the present study, we used the optimized PURE system and a simple procedure to successfully synthesize trastuzumab and other IgG antibodies, including members of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses, in the active form. The synthesis used PCR products as templates and was completed in a total of 2 days. The yield ranged from 33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 to 124&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, which would be sufficient for small-scale evaluation experiments at the early stages of development of monoclonal antibodies, for example. The information obtained during optimization of the synthesis temperature and of the template DNA ratio for individual IgGs may provide important information for improving the stability of each IgG. On the other hand, in the case of synthesis of multiple IgGs at the same time with the optimized PURE system, a condition of 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and <italic>LC</italic> DNA:<italic>HC</italic> DNA&#x02009;=&#x02009;1:1 is recommended as the universal synthesis condition for high-throughput. The reaction mixture containing synthesized IgG was directly applied to ELISA and the affinities could be evaluated even without purification. Additionally, as we report in the supporting information, the level of harmful endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) is low in the PURE<italic>frex</italic><sup>&#x000ae;</sup> kit, so the reaction mixture containing synthesized product could be directly applied to cell-based assays for functional screening when using more than 400-fold dilution without purification (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).
