    "Background:The Suwan population is a well-known maize germplasm that has greatly contributed to the development of maize breeding in tropical and subtropical regions, especially in southern China. Inbred lines derived from the Suwan population always contain stronger resistance and extensive adaptability in different environments. To evaluate the genetic character of inbred lines derived from the Suwan population, a panel including 226 inbred line derived from the Suwan population and temperate resources was assembled and genotyped by using MaizeSNP50 BeadChip, which contained 56,110 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. This panel contained 98 temperate inbred line and 128 lines derived from the Suwan population. Results:The results showed that high genetic diversity was found, with PIC and GD to be 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. In addition, two novel subgroups were identified, with representative inbred lines as HCL645 and Ki32, respectively. One acknowledged heterotic group of Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (SS) was also identified in this study. This study can provide some additional scientific evidence for heterotic group division and use in maize. Additionally, lower linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels and weaker genetic relationships were found, with an average LD level of 41.15 kb that varied from 3.5 to 96 kb. A total of 82.8% of paired relative kinships ranged from 0.05 to 0.28. Conclusions:These results would not only facilitate maize breeding practices in tropical and subtropical regions, but also revealed that this panel can be used in dissecting the genetic basis of complex quantitative traits' variations by using genome-wide association studies (GWAS)."
