Inbred lines derived from the Suwan population always contain stronger resistance and extensive adaptability in different environments. To evaluate the genetic character of inbred lines derived from the Suwan population, a panel including 226 inbred line derived from the Suwan population and temperate resources was assembled and genotyped by using MaizeSNP50 BeadChip, which contained 56,110 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

This study can provide some additional scientific evidence for heterotic group division and use in maize. Additionally, lower linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels and weaker genetic relationships were found, with an average LD level of 41.15&#x02009;kb that varied from 3.5 to 96&#x02009;kb.

Many local landraces or farmer&#x02019;s varieties were formed owing to the repeated introduction, artificial selection, and adaptation to different environments. Some representative inbred lines with different origins were produced, and relevant hybrids were released. To continuously improve the performance of hybrids adapting to partial ecological environments effectively, heterotic groups and heterotic patterns were clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which played important roles in maize commercial breeding programs. However, to date, less than 5% of germplasm is used in maize breeding around the world, and less than 1% is used in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">A few classical inbred lines were repeated used to develop new lines and excellent hybrids in temperature conditions, which contributed mostly to maize hybrid breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. i.e., B73, PH207, Mo17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and Huangzaosi (HZS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].For instance, most lines belonged to Stiff Stalk (BSSS) and were derived from B73, and approximately 35% of Pioneer&#x02019;s hybrids were from BSSS. Mo17 was common used in all U.S. seed companies, and more than 45% of Pioneer&#x02019;s commercial hybrids contain the pedigree of Mo17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the Huang-Huai River region of China, HZS is widely used during the maize breeding process, has derived more than 40 elite lines and 80 hybrids and has greatly contributed to the industrial development of Chinese maize. For example, the maize hybrid &#x02018;Zhendan 958&#x02019; (Zheng58&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Chang7&#x02013;2) has been grown in an area of more than 35 million ha in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In addition, Tuxpe&#x000f1;o is one of the well-known maize germplasms that has greatly contributed to the development of tropical maize breeding programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tuxpe&#x000f1;o maize pools often contain a broad genetic base and show larger diversity than that in temperate populations. Tuxpe&#x000f1;o germplasm&#x02019;s productivity and crossing it with the race ETO result in Tuxpe&#x000f1;o-ETO heterotic patterns in tropical maize breeding, which are widely used in Thailand, Colombia, and Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, during the Tuxpe&#x000f1;o maize pools&#x02019; ultilization process, its lower resistance to some diseases and insect pests in tropical regions was found, which limited its widely use. Therefore, some improvements were done during maize breeding practice. Since the 1960s, 36 accessions have been collected across the world, and relevant agronomic traits have been evaluated in order to improve maize adaptation under Thailand&#x02019;s cultivation conditions. Based on the results of data analysis, one synthetic variety of Suwan1 with excellent performance was released through modified ear-to-row selection methods, which showed better performance in tropical regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and rapidly spread to tropical and subtropical regions as a result. The heterotic pattern by crossing lines from Suwan1to temperate resources became famous and was widely used in subtropical regions, especially in southwest China. However, knowledge on the genetic differences between Suwan population and temperate maize germplasm is still limited, which remains one of the impediments to its increased use in breeding programs.</p><p id="Par24">For decades, many marker-based studies have addressed genetic diversity, population structures, and genetic relationships by using different panels and markers Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed that only four heterotic groups were identified when integrating only the Chinese elite lines from temperature regions together, which was smaller than that found by using tropical and temperate lines together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In Yan&#x02019;s studies, 632 lines from temperate and tropical/subtropical public breeding practices were used: it contained 351 tropical/subtropical lines from the Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and showed much higher genetic diversity than that in the temperate panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, fewer markers and resources of maize germplasm were used in other reports, which would provide limited information when dissecting the potential genetic diversity in maize germplasm.</p><p id="Par25">By using the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method, Romay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] evaluated the genetic characters of 2815 accessions in the USA national maize inbred seed bank. Based on 681,257 SNP markers, many more rare alleles were identified, but only a modest amount of the available diversity was found in the commercial germplasm. Strong population stratification was identified, with a small number of key lines as the center of one cluster. This genotypic information provided abundant insight into maize genetic diversity around the world. However, most lines used in previous studies were publicly available, representing historical recombinants during the maize domestication and improvement progress. Along with the development of private commercial maize breeding, more and more new elite inbred lines were produced and widely used in modern maize breeding practice. This was especially true for the Suwan population, which came from tropical regions, and derived many more elite lines widely used in tropical/subtropical maize breeding program, such as Ki32, QR273, and QB446. Therefore, collecting one naturally diverse panel that contained the latest lines derived from temperate and Suwan resources that are widely used in modern breeding programs is better for in-depth study of the genetic character of maize germplasm. Based on this panel, we dissect the genetic relationship between pair-lines by using the high-throughput genotyping method, which is important not only for expanding gene pools to accelerate maize breeding progress but also for providing additional information for evaluating whether this panel is suitable for genome-wide study (GWAS) in analyzing variation of complex traits.</p><p id="Par26">In this study, 226 accessions derived from the Suwan population and temperate resources were selected and genotyped by using the MaizeSNP50 BeadChip, including approximately 56,110 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

In this study, three subgroups are divided first, with representative lines selected as HCL645, Ki32, and B73, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Most lines belonging to the subgroup Ki32 were selected directly from the landrace of the Suwan population, or contained Suwan blood in their pedigrees. For instance, an inbred line of Ki32 is selected from the landrace of Suwan1 population, directly. QB446 was selected from the crossers of the Suwan1 population and Mo17. The two lines were also appointed into the same subgroup of Ki32. The heterotic mode of crossing lines from the subgroup of B73 with lines from the subgroup of Ki32 is widely used for maize breeding in the southern Chinese environment. Some excellent hybrids were released and widely used for maize production in southern China, such as Jinyu838 with parental lines QB446 and QB1018, wherein QB1018 belongs to the subgroup of B73 and QB446 to the subgroup of Ki32.

In this study, lower LD levels were found, with average LD decay distance to be 41.15&#x02009;kb, varying from 3.5 to 96&#x02009;kb (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This was much smaller than that when using elite temperate maize germplasm only, with average LD decay distance at 328&#x02009;kb, varying from 272 to 595&#x02009;kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the LD levels found in this study were also larger than that identified in Yan&#x02019;s report, with average LD levels at 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;kb, varying from 1 to 10&#x02009;kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One possible reason is that in Yan&#x02019;s panel, many original tropical accessions were included, and much more genetic diversity existed. However, in this study, where many improved tropical lines were derived from tropical populations and some local landraces, the tropical blood ratio was lower. In addition, gene diversity (GD) of 0.67 and PIC of 0.60 was identified in this study, which was obviously higher than that reported before, with GD and PIC ay 0.36 and 0.29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One possible reason for this phenomenon is that much more tropical maize germplasm were included in this study. In our previous research, 367 elite lines were collected. Because of the narrower genetic base among lines, stronger pair-relationships existed, with 94.97% of paired relative kinship ranging from 0.05 to 0.28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which was significantly higher than that detected in this study, with 82.8% of paired relative kinship varying from 0.1 to 0.4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Because of this, we integrated maize germplasm from Suwan and temperate regions together in this study, wherein the Suwan population showed much more abundant genetic diversity than that of temperate populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These results showed that the panel used in this study contained more abundant genetic diversity, along with lower LD levels, which would provide higher detection resolution for using genome-wide association study to dissect the variation in complex quantitative traits in maize.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">In this study, we clarified the population structure differentiation of maize germplasm derived from Suwan germplasm and related improved lines. Two novel subgroups were found, with representative lines identified as Ki32 and HCL645, respectively. However, much more genetic diversity and lower LD level were also detected, which revealed that this panel could be used for the dissection of quantitative traits&#x02019; genetic variation by using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) strategy. These results would provide some additional information for heterotic group division and use. As a result, this may facilitate better maize breeding, especially in tropical and subtropical regions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par34">The maize panel used in this study contained 226 accessions derived from the Suwan population and temperate resources.

In addition, most temperate lines were used in the latest maize breeding program in China, such as QB1013 and HC3. In addition, 128 accessions derived from the Suwan population were also selected, such as Ki32, QR273, and QB446, all of which are widely used in maize breeding practices in the southwest of China.
