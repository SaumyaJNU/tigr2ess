While significant research has focused on &#x0201c;drugging&#x0201d; components of the PI3K/mTOR network, efforts have also been directed towards inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-dependent translation. Small molecule inhibitors of this complex have been identified, characterized, and used to validate the rationale of targeting this step to curtail tumor cell growth and modulate chemotherapy response. One such class of compounds are the rocaglates, secondary metabolites from the plant genus <italic>Aglaia</italic>, which target the RNA helicase subunit of eIF4F, eIF4A. Here we explore the ability of synthetic derivatives of aglaiastatins and an aglaroxin derivative to target the translation process <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and find the synthetic derivative <italic>oxo</italic>-aglaiastatin to possess such activity. <italic>Oxo</italic>-aglaiastatin inhibited translation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and synergized with doxorubicin, ABT-199 (a Bcl-2 antagonist), and dexamethasone when tested on hematological cancer cells.

A critical control point involves eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F, a complex that recruits the 40&#x02009;S ribosome (and associated factors) to mRNA 5&#x02032; ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. eIF4F is a heterotrimeric complex that binds the mRNA cap structure <italic>via</italic> its eIF4E subunit and utilizes its eIF4A helicase subunit to unwind local mRNA secondary structure in preparation for ribosome binding. eIF4F assembly falls under the governance of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, a signalling cascade usurped in the majority of human cancers - making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. It has been shown that eIF4E can exist in two distinct complexes, one as a component of eIF4F and the second, in complex with one of three repressor proteins known as eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP). Activation of mTOR leads to phosphorylation of 4E-BP, disrupting its association with eIF4E and increasing levels of eIF4F<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Alterations in eIF4F levels are associated with a selective change in the translation of choice mRNAs, several of which encode for activities that fuel the Hallmarks of Cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Strategies that aim to dampen eIF4F levels or activity are currently being explored as anti-neoplastic agents and show promising activity in pre-clinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Among the small molecules found to inhibit eIF4F activity, rocaglates have shown impressive potency and exert their effects through the selective inhibition of eIF4A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

These plants produce several cyclopenta[<italic>b</italic>]benzofuran-containing metabolites, among which rocaglamide (Roc) A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was the first isolated active compound and shown to exhibit anti-leukemic activity in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since then, a large number of naturally occurring and synthetic rocaglamide derivatives (&#x0003e;100) have been characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These fall within one of three classes based on their core structures: (i) cyclopenta[<italic>bc</italic>]benzopyrans (aka thapsakins), (ii) benzo[<italic>b</italic>]oxepines (aka thapoxepines) and, (iii) cyclopenta[<italic>b</italic>]benzofurans (aka rocaglates or flavaglines) (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Among these metabolites, it is only the latter that have activity towards eIF4A and inhibit translation initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, synthetic <italic>aza</italic>-rocaglates, in which the benzofuran ring oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen, have been synthesized and do not inhibit translation - highlighting the critical nature of the furan core for activity (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. One of the most studied rocaglates, silvestrol, exhibits potent anti-proliferative activity against many cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in xenograft models (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). Structure-activity relationship studies, facilitated by the development of an enantioselective synthesis approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> have led to the identification of a synthetic derivative, (&#x02212;)-CR-1-31-b (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) - a hydroxamate-containing rocaglamide with improved biological activity and anti-cancer properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Among the cyclopenta[<italic>b</italic>]benzofuran metabolites, aglaiastatins and aglaroxins have not been as extensively characterized (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These molecules differ from rocaglates by the presence of a pyrimidone unit fused to the cyclopenta[<italic>b</italic>]benzofuran core while retaining the carbonyl and tertiary amine functional groups that could participate in target recognition.

CMLD010582 was synthesized as a potential stable analogue of aglaiastatin, a compound known to undergo facile oxidation to the pyrimidinone aglaroxin C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our initial comparison involved scoring for translation inhibitory activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in Krebs-2 extracts programmed with a FF/HCV/Ren bicistronic mRNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This reporter encodes for firefly luciferase (FLuc) which reports on cap-dependent protein synthesis and renilla luciferase (RLuc) which is driven by the hepatitis C viral (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and recruits ribosomes in an eIF4F-independent manner.

Cells expressing the eIF4A1<sup>F163L</sup> mutant protein were resistant to protein synthesis inhibition by CMLD011580 at concentrations up to 900&#x02009;nM.

The ability of ABT-199 to antagonize BCL-2 and of CMLD011580 to inhibit MYC expression may account for the synergy seen with these two compounds.
