    "Translation is a highly regulated process that is perturbed in human cancers, often through activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway which impacts directly on the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation. While significant research has focused on \"drugging\" components of the PI3K/mTOR network, efforts have also been directed towards inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-dependent translation. Small molecule inhibitors of this complex have been identified, characterized, and used to validate the rationale of targeting this step to curtail tumor cell growth and modulate chemotherapy response. One such class of compounds are the rocaglates, secondary metabolites from the plant genus Aglaia, which target the RNA helicase subunit of eIF4F, eIF4A. Here we explore the ability of synthetic derivatives of aglaiastatins and an aglaroxin derivative to target the translation process in vitro and in vivo and find the synthetic derivative oxo-aglaiastatin to possess such activity. Oxo-aglaiastatin inhibited translation in vitro and in vivo and synergized with doxorubicin, ABT-199 (a Bcl-2 antagonist), and dexamethasone when tested on hematological cancer cells. The biological activity of oxo-aglaiastatin was shown to be a consequence of inhibiting eIF4A1 activity."
