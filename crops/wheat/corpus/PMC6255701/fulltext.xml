Wheat yield per unit land area is a function of the weight of individual grains and the numbers of grains per unit land area (influenced by numbers of ears per plant and number of filled grains per ear). Numbers of grains per unit land area is a complex, weakly inherited trait, but individual grain weight is more stably inherited (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Kuchel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Sadras and Slafer, 2012</xref>). Although there is frequently a trade-off between individual grain weight and grain number, this relationship may not be due to competition (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Acreche and Slafer, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Ferrante <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Indeed, it is possible to produce wheat varieties that have both high grain numbers per unit land area and high individual grain weights. Robust quantitative trait loci (QTL) that increase grain weight without reducing grain number have been identified (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Understanding how individual grain weight is determined could thus contribute to efforts to increase wheat yields.</p><p>Many previous attempts to understand and to increase final grain weight in wheat have focussed on substrate availability and the capacity for starch synthesis during grain filling. Since starch is by far the major component of the mature grain, it has been assumed that variation in the capacity for starch synthesis during grain filling can influence final grain weight. There is some experimental support for this assumption. Manipulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the first committed enzyme of starch synthesis, is reported to increase final grain weight under some conditions. Specifically, transgenic wheat plants with elevated AGPase activity during grain filling have been reported to have both more grains and higher yields (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Smidansky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic></xref>), and in one case higher individual seed weight (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic></xref>). Haplotypes of genes encoding both the large and the small subunits of AGPase are also reported to show association with wheat grain weight (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Rose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Indirect evidence for the importance of AGPase comes from experiments in which developing wheat ears were treated with a chemical from which the sugar-signalling molecule trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) is released by UV light. T6P is believed to increase starch synthesis, putatively through activation of AGPase (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kolbe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Lunn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and elevated expression of genes encoding enzymes of starch synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Application of T6P to wheat ears was found to result in larger grains with elevated starch contents on a weight basis (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The capacity for starch synthesis was not assessed, but the data are consistent with the idea that T6P produces larger grains by accelerating starch synthesis.</p><p>There is also evidence that the second enzyme of starch synthesis, starch synthase (SS), may be important for grain filling. First, SS activities are barely sufficient to support the rate of starch synthesis throughout wheat grain filling, and the rate of starch synthesis and SS activity decline in parallel as grains mature (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Hawker and Jenner, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Tomlinson and Denyer, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi and Jenner, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Other enzymes on the sucrose-to-starch pathway have much higher activities than required to support the flux to starch. Second, the widely observed deleterious effect of temperatures above ~25 &#x000b0;C on wheat grain starch synthesis and hence on grain size and yield is partly attributable to the properties of SS. It is reported to have very low Q<sub>10</sub> values and to exhibit thermal instability, and elevated temperatures may reduce SS gene transcription (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bhullar and Jenner, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Rijven, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Hawker and Jenner, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Keeling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Denyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Jenner, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Hurkman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi and Jenner, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Reduction of SS activity in developing grain by short heat pulses has led to the conclusion that grain filling is controlled predominantly by SS, particularly at high temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Keeling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest that variation in endosperm AGPase and/or SS activity during grain development can affect starch accumulation and hence may affect final grain weight.</p><p>Increased supply of sucrose into the developing grain can also influence final grain weight, but the basis and extent of this effect is unclear. Expression of the barley sucrose transporter HvSUT1 in transgenic wheat increases the capacity for sucrose uptake into developing grains and also increases final grain weight, but has minor or variable effects on starch, sucrose, and protein concentrations in the grain (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Weichert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Saalbach <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Elevated grain weight in this case may be due to increased endosperm cell numbers rather than increased storage-product synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Weichert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The idea that increased supply of assimilates generally increases grain growth is contradicted by numerous physiological experiments in which the relationship between assimilate supply (i.e. leaves, the &#x02018;source&#x02019;) and the capacity of the grain to use assimilates for growth (the &#x02018;sink&#x02019;) is manipulated, either by removal of grains or by removal or shading of leaves (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Serrago <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, and discussions therein).</p><p>Despite indications that substrate availability and starch synthesis capacity during grain filling can affect final grain weight, the general relationship between these variables has not been systematically investigated. Most studies of starch synthesis capacity have examined relatively few genotypes (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), and recent studies have examined transcript levels rather than enzyme activities (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Extrapolation from transcript levels to enzymatic capacity is problematic: the enzymes are encoded by multiple genes (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Stamova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and changes in transcript levels do not necessarily result in changes in protein contents or activities (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Fernie and Stitt, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In order to establish the extent to which final grain weight is influenced by substrate availability and the capacity for starch synthesis during grain filling, we measured the maximum catalytic activity (an estimate of the total capacity of the tissue for a particular enzymatic reaction) of AGPase and SS, and the levels of carbohydrate substrates for starch synthesis during grain filling in a large panel of diverse genotypes of hexaploid wheat, and examined the relationship between these values, the accumulation of starch, and the weight of individual grains at maturity. To provide insights relevant to the wheat crop, samples were taken from field-grown plants, in two successive years. Plants were grown in Norfolk, UK, an area of high wheat yields with a moderate climate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Growth and sampling</title><p>Elite cultivars of wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) were from the Earliness &#x00026; Resilience for Yield in a Changed Climate (ERYCC) panel generated with funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK Government) and the UK Home-Grown Cereals Authority (Project LK0992: <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Clarke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

In 2014, a subset of 21 elite cultivars and landraces was grown on 1.5 &#x000d7; 1.5 m plots at Bawburgh.</p><p>Individual primary ears from plants inside the plot were tagged on the day on which they underwent anthesis. At time-points during development, ears were harvested from six plants per genotype, sealed in plastic bags and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored on dry ice for transport to a &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C freezer. Samples of grains for enzyme and metabolite assays were dissected into pre-weighed tubes, on dry ice. Each sample contained 10 grains from the outer (most proximal to the rachis) florets (positions F1 and F2) of spikelets in the central region (from 25&#x02013;75% of the base-to-tip distance) of a single ear. Following weighing, sample tubes were stored at &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>Grain was harvested after whole-plant senescence (complete yellowing of leaves, peduncle, and spike).

Our conclusions are subject to the limitations of our experimental set-up. The technical demands of assaying enzymes and metabolites on numerous samples meant that it was not possible to replicate the genotypes in independent plots, as is usual practice for field experimentation. Instead, we repeated a large part of the experiment in two growing seasons. Our conclusions are based on consideration of these two, independent sets of analyses.</p><p>In general, our results indicated that final grain weight was not strongly influenced by the availability of sugars or the activities of AGPase or starch synthase in the genotypes and under the environmental conditions we studied. We first discuss the roles of sugar availability, starch synthetic capacity, and starch accumulation in determining final grain weight, and compare our data in these individual respects with the outcomes of previous studies. We then evaluate the idea that developmental processes rather than grain filling determine final grain weight, and discuss whether this is likely to be the case for genotypes and environments different from those in our experiments.</p><sec id="s16"><title>Final grain weight is not dependent on levels of sugars in the grain from 10 DAA onwards</title><p>Our data revealed no consistent, positive correlations between final grain weight and levels of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in the grain on a weight basis from 10 DAA onwards (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table S2)</xref>. In broad terms, these findings imply that the availability of substrate for starch synthesis in the developing grain did not determine final grain weight, and hence that attempts to increase the availability of sugars in the grain during the main period of grain filling are relatively unlikely to result in heavier grains in high-yielding environments.</p><p>Other studies have also concluded that starch synthesis during grain filling is not usually limited by the availability of sucrose. For example, manipulation of sucrose supply to grains by the removal of leaves or by provision of exogenous sucrose to detached, developing ears has no major effects on dry weight gain, implying that the supply of sucrose is not limiting for grain growth (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Jenner and Rathjen, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Jenner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Hexoses fell to low levels during the first 30 DAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).

Glucose seems to be important for events early in development rather than for starch synthesis. Reduced import into young grains profoundly affects development of transfer cells in the basal endosperm transfer layer in maize, suggesting a specific, developmental signalling function (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Sosso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Final grain weight is not strongly dependent on AGPase or starch synthase activity from 10 DAA onwards</title><p>We found no significant correlations between final grain weight and AGPase activity on a weight basis from 10 DAA onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table S2)</xref>.

It is thus unlikely that grain filling and hence final grain weight were limited by AGPase activity during the main part of grain filling.</p><p>These results are at odds with the widespread expectation that high AGPase activity in the endosperm leads to high starch content and hence high grain weight (discussed in <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Tuncel and Okita, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cakir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), and with previous research that supports this expectation. For example, transgenic wheat with elevated AGPase activity in the grain has higher final grain weight than untransformed controls (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013<italic>a</italic></xref>), and polymorphisms in genes encoding the subunits of AGPase have been associated with variation in final grain weight in two different panels of wheat genotypes (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Rose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Hou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). We suggest that these effects of AGPase variation on grain weight may not arise during grain filling, but may instead reflect a crucial role for the enzyme in events around the time of anthesis that influence final grain weight via the extent of expansion of enclosing maternal tissues or patterns of endosperm cellularisation. Support for this suggestion is as follows.</p><p>There is good evidence that AGPase activity around anthesis can influence numbers of grains that set, and/or very early developmental processes in the grain. Expression of an inhibition-insensitive form of endosperm AGPase in maize increases kernel yield under heat stress: <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hannah <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> found that this effect was associated with increased numbers of mature kernels. As well as expression during kernel filling, the transgene was expressed in reproductive tissues around the time of fertilisation. This expression increased the chance that a given ovary would develop into a kernel under heat stress. Genes encoding the main endosperm AGPase of wheat are also expressed in the developing spike prior to fertilization (small subunit genes 7AS_1B2A8C929, 7BS_4FBE4B00A, 7DS_02539EB3B; large subunit genes 1AL_A1B2A8EB0, 1BL_190920E1E, 1DL_844FE40E6; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wheat-expression.com/;">http://www.wheat-expression.com/;</ext-link><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Borrill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; see also <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Chrimes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and there is an association between haplotypes for one of these AGPase genes and the numbers of grains per spike (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Rose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). It has been suggested that reproductive structures are susceptible to starvation-induced abortion around the time of fertilisation, and that starch reserves help to prevent this problem (see <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin and Boyer, 2004</xref>). This idea may explain why modulation of AGPase activity in reproductive structures influences grain numbers rather than final grain size.</p><p>In contrast to our findings for AGPase, there were some significant correlations between final grain weight and SS activity on a weight basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, SS activity was not correlated with starch content on a weight basis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table S2)</xref>. It is thus unlikely that SS activity influenced grain weight by determining the amount of starch per unit weight. The mechanistic basis of the relationship between SS activity and grain weight remains unclear.</p><p>As described in the Introduction, SS activity is strongly limiting for starch synthesis in wheat grains at temperatures at the upper end of the physiological range. Surprisingly, the molecular basis of this potentially important phenomenon is not known. QTL and association studies have not found robust links between SS haplotypes and either starch content or weight of mature grains, but these approaches are compromised by the complexity of the SS family. Four different SS isoforms contribute to synthesis of the major, amylopectin component of starch, and there is likely to be both synergy and a high degree of redundancy between these forms (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Tetlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). A fifth SS, granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) is exclusively responsible for the synthesis of the amylose component of starch, but there is good genetic evidence that it is not important for starch content or weight of mature grains (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ahuja <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Hucl and Ramachandran, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Yamamori and Yasui, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It remains possible that other steps in starch synthesis in wheat endosperm are important in determining final grain weight. The possibility that control is exerted at the point of the entry of ADP-glucose into the amyloplast via the transporter Brittle1 (Bt1), was investigated by over-expression of <italic>Bt1</italic> in rice endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cakir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Capacity for ADP-glucose transport into amyloplasts was increased in the transgenic lines but there was no effect on grain weight, indicating that this step exercised little control over starch synthesis under normal circumstances. It is also possible that although variation in activities of individual enzymes have little effect on final grain weight, a simultaneous change in the same direction of most or all of the enzymes on the sucrose-to-starch pathway could have a significant effect (see <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Fell, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our conclusion that that final grain weight was not limited by the maximum catalytic activities of AGPase or starch synthase or by substrate availability during grain filling is seemingly at odds with the demonstration that application of T6P analogues during grain filling increases starch content and final grain size (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In Arabidopsis leaves, applications of the same analogues increase the rate of starch synthesis (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), so it is reasonable to propose that increased starch synthesis may account for greater grain size in T6P-treated wheat ears. We suggest that T6P may modulate multiple aspects of grain metabolism, rather than acting on a single component of the starch biosynthetic machinery. In Arabidopsis seedlings in liquid culture, application of T6P analogues altered the transcript levels for multiple genes under the control of the energy-sensing protein kinase SnRK1 as well as for several enzymes of starch metabolism (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Final grain weight is independent of starch content on a weight basis</title><p>Our data indicated that final grain weight was not strongly related to starch accumulation on a weight basis during grain filling (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). If starch accumulation determines grain weight, we would expect large grains to have a higher percentage of starch than small grains. This was not the case: at maturity, there was much more variation between genotypes in grain weight than in starch content on a weight basis. In other words, starch made up a similar percentage of grain weight in all genotypes, regardless of final grain weight. There were no significant correlations between these two variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table S2)</xref>. There was also little correspondence between final grain weight and the pattern of accumulation of starch during the main period of grain filling. Although the overall contribution of starch accumulation to the increase in grain dry weight fell from 30 DAA onwards (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), patterns of starch accumulation varied considerably between genotypes and were not obviously correlated with either starch content or final grain weight. For example, two elite cultivars with high grain weights and starch contents in 2013 had very different patterns of starch accumulation during grain filling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Text S1</xref>). Overall, the data implied that the extent of starch accumulation was determined by the physical limits on grain volume set by developmental processes, rather than grain size and weight being determined by the extent of starch accumulation.</p><p>Our data support the notion that final grain weight may be determined primarily by developmental factors such as cell size in either the outer, maternal tissues or in the endosperm. This idea is consistent with evidence that early developmental processes can be important in determining final grain weight. For example, it has previously been shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase GW2, a factor controlling grain weight that is conserved in species as diverse as Arabidopsis (in which it is named DA1) and rice (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), influences carpel growth prior to anthesis in wheat (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Other studies have confirmed the importance of carpel size in determining the size of the mature grain (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Calderini <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Xie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), although carpel/ovary volume may be influenced by environmental as well as developmental factors (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Calderini <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Benincasa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Second, a QTL responsible for 7% variation in grain weight has been shown to act by altering the length of pericarp cells, which in turn affects the maximum length to which the grain can grow (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Brinton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above conclusions, we suggest that in order to achieve higher individual grain weights, breeders and biotechnologists must find ways to increase the cell size and/or number in maternal and/or endosperm tissues of the grain. Higher individual grain weights are unlikely to be achieved by manipulation of either photosynthesis (hence sucrose supply) or starch-synthesising enzymes during grain filling. We emphasise that these conclusions apply to the main period of grain filling. As discussed above, the capacity for starch synthesis and the supply of substrates from photosynthesis may be crucial determinants of various yield parameters in the period around anthesis and early in grain development (see also <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Tuncel and Okita, 2013</xref>). The avoidance of starvation&#x02014;especially during adverse conditions&#x02014;and the early establishment of sink strength may influence ovary size (see above) and how many grains will fill (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), and may also impact on individual grain weight at maturity by influencing critical cell division and other developmental processes immediately post anthesis.</p><p>Although our results were obtained with winter wheat grown under near-optimal conditions for high yield, our conclusions may be more widely applicable. Many experiments in which assimilate supply to the developing grain has been manipulated&#x02014;through reduction of photosynthesis (defoliation or shading) or through removal of grains&#x02014;have led to the conclusion that the supply of assimilates from photosynthesis does not limit the growth of grains. The failure of grain weight to respond to either a limitation or an increase in assimilate supply has been observed in both near-optimal and stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Acreche and Slafer, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Serrago <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite fact that we did not use replicated plots in our experiments, the application of PCo analysis to provide information about degrees of similarity between genotypes was not compromised because it works on the &#x02018;means&#x02019; of the pseudo-replicate data per genotype. The input matrix to the PCo procedure thus contains independent observations, allowing valid comparison of the genotypes. We emphasise that the analysis is descriptive rather than based on formal statistical testing. We also cannot discount the possibility that environment as well as genotype influenced the outcomes of these analyses. Nonetheless this dataset allows the generation of hypotheses to be tested in future work.</p><p>Principal coordinates analysis tended to separate the elite cultivars from the landraces when genotypes were grown in the same location in 2014, indicating that these groups may be distinct when multiple parameters are considered together. Dendrograms derived from similarity matrices suggested that the elite cultivars were as diverse as the landraces with respect to most of the variables we measured, even though the range of final grain weights was far greater for landraces than for elite cultivars. This finding appears to run counter to the common belief that plant breeding has seriously reduced genetic diversity in modern, elite varieties (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Tanksley and McCouch, 1997</xref>). It may also reflect the fact that the variables we measured have not been subject to strong selection during breeding in the recent past. Increased grain number per unit area is a major factor in yield improvement, with a relatively small contribution from variables related to grain filling and grain size (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Sadras and Slafer, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Slafer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig S1.
