Coding sequences of wheat genes obtained from ENSEMBL were aligned to known AMT and NRT sequences of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, barley, maize, rice, and wheat to retrieve homologous genes. Bayesian phylogenetic relationships among these genes showed distinct classification of sequences with significant homology to <italic>NRT</italic>1, <italic>NRT2</italic>, and <italic>NRT3</italic> (<italic>NAR2</italic>). Inter-species gene duplication analysis showed that eight AMT and 77 NRT genes were orthologous to the AMT and NRT genes of aforementioned plant species. Expression patterns of these genes were studied via whole transcriptome sequencing of 21-day old seedlings of five spring wheat lines. Eight AMT and 52 NRT genes were differentially expressed between root and shoot; and 131 genes did not express neither in root nor in shoot of 21-day old seedlings. Homeologous genes in the A, B, and D genomes, characterized by high sequence homology, revealed that their counterparts exhibited different expression patterns. This complement and evolutionary relationship of wheat AMT and NRT genes is expected to help in development of wheat germplasm with increased efficiency in nitrogen uptake and usage.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nitrogen (N) is a major element in plant physiology and metabolic processes. It is used in synthesis of amino acids, proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and secondary metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> as well as in signaling of several cellular and morphological processes that regulate plant growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, nitrate, the primary source of inorganic nitrogen for plants, is involved in early growth of lateral roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and controls the ratio of root: shoot growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">N is available to the plant via uptake of two main molecules: ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Plants have evolved to develop different affinity transport systems to cope with and operate under variable (high and low) external nitrogen availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These two uptake systems are referred to as low affinity transport system (LATS) and high affinity transport system (HATS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. LATS is involved in transporting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> at high external NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentrations (&#x0003e;1.1&#x02009;mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In contrast, HATS is activated when NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> is limited (&#x0003c;1.1&#x02009;mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The two main nitrate transporter (NRT) gene families are the low-affinity <italic>NRT1</italic> and the high-affinity <italic>NRT2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The <italic>NRT1</italic> family is well documented and averages 54 family members in land plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> of which only <italic>NRT1.1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>1.8</italic> have been postulated to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The <italic>NRT2</italic> gene family is thoroughly characterized and consists of 7 members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similar to the NRT family, the ammonium transporter (AMT) genes are divided into <italic>AMT1</italic> and <italic>AMT2</italic> based on affinity levels. <italic>AMT1</italic> family consists of 1&#x02013;7 members and <italic>AMT2</italic> family consists of 1&#x02013;10 members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, six AMT genes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and ten in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, the HATS and LATS systems are different for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> predominately uses HATS because of low NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations in the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Currently, only 16 nitrate transporter (NPF) genes are postulated in hexaploid wheat and are localized in all chromosomes except 4A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Expression of these genes is often tissue specific. The genes <italic>NPF6.1</italic> and <italic>NPF6.2</italic> were highly abundant in roots yet low in shoots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>NPF6.3</italic> had similar abundance in the roots and shoots but <italic>NRT6.4</italic> had much higher abundance in the roots. Relative to nitrate transporters, the AMT genes have not been extensively studied in wheat. To date, only two wheat AMT genes &#x02013; <italic>TaAMT1</italic>;<italic>1</italic> and <italic>TaAMT1;2</italic> &#x02013; have been reported in the scientific literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Uncovering and characterizing the gene sequences of previously undetected AMT (as well as NRT) could help in the study of these genes with relation to N availability and use efficiency (NUE). In crops, NUE is defined as the plants&#x02019; capacity to use the applied nitrogen and transform into grains and biomass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. N fertilizers can represent a significant cost to farmers and the environment, and as such, optimizing NUE can help reduce the cost of N applications and decrease environmental contamination resulting from excessive N inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Understanding how and when nitrate and ammonium transporter genes express in plants from their earliest growth stages is one way to further characterize genotypes with superior NUE. As wheat is one of the most important staple crops in the world, identifying accessions with higher NUE could increase wheat production at lesser cost to meet the demands of a growing global population.</p><p id="Par6">Lately, using next-gen sequencing approaches for crop genomics studies have been gaining popularity. A particular usefulness of the rich next-gen data is that it allows one to obtain an in-depth insight of the genome, including that of the coding and non-coding regions. Sequencing and study of a crop transcriptome can contribute to identification of genes and transcripts involved in important pathways, such as the genes involved in the ammonium and nitrate transport systems identified and discussed in this study. Furthermore, functional annotation of the genes can assist in broadening our knowledge of tissue-specific (as well as generation and stage specific) genes that can further contribute in development of nutrient efficient plant varieties. Our work expands on this idea, and attempts to capture a snapshot of the physiological level landscape of nitrate and ammonium transporter genes in wheat by making use of the publicly available wheat gene sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Previously reported ammonium and nitrate transporter studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> have used fewer genes obtained from less and different plant species. Here, we present a comprehensive set of wheat AMT and NRT genes leveraging on the availability of abundant genomic information and tools.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, in this study, we present phylogenetic relationships among nitrate and ammonium transporter genes in hexaploid wheat, and their in-seedling expression patterns. A broad list of wheat nitrate and ammonium transporter genes was assembled based on homologous and/or orthologous relationship with genes from the model plant species <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and four crop species (barley, maize, rice, and wheat). By identifying the molecular pathways involved, we provide putative functional annotation of the assembled genes. The approach taken and methods implemented highlight a simplified process for pathway specific study models in other plant and animal species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome sequencing</title><p id="Par8">As the experiment constituted of five wheat lines and two organ types (root and shoot), 10 cDNA libraries were constructed for sequencing.

The number of raw reads generated from these libraries amounted to 487 million. Removal of reads with Q score &#x0003c;20 resulted in loss of less than 3% of the reads with 483 million reads retained.

During the analysis in both approaches, an exon was retained only if it was expressed at a count-per-million of &#x0003e;1 in at least 3 samples. This led to reduction of wAMT genes to 53 from 57, and wNRT genes to 459 from 500. An FDR threshold of &#x0003c;0.001 was then applied to obtain the DEGs in edgeR. FDR-correction was not available in NOISeq hence the q value, which is defined as the ratio of probability of differential expression to probability of non-differential expression, was used at 0.9. We provide a comparison between the two methods at the end of this section, yet limit our primary discussion to edgeR results. Eight wAMT DEGs were detected whose expression were significantly different between root and shoot across all five lines. These genes were located on chromosomes 5B, 6A, 6B, and 6D. Specifically, 6 were detected in Glenlea, 5 in Red Fife, 4 in Ruby, 5 in Stoa, and 8 in Sumai3.

For genes common in &#x02265;2 lines, the log fold change (logFC) in expression was similar for all genes in all lines.

Genes wNRT77&#x02013;86 and wNRT465&#x02013;467, which are orthologs of three maize genes <italic>DAA60764.1</italic>, <italic>NP_001288684.1</italic>, and <italic>AAO67353.1</italic>, are all placed in Clade I of the wNRT tree (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

Furthermore, the genes had to be present in at least two of the three wheat sub-genomes to be declared homeologous. This led to detection of 8 and 12 sets of homeologous wAMT and wNRT genes, respectively (Supplementary Dataset). While not an exhaustive list, these gene sets provided adequate information to understand their inter-relationships during phylogenetic assignment and in tissue-specific gene expression. Unsurprisingly, the homeologous gene sets often grouped near each other in both wAMT and wNRT trees. For example, three wAMT genes &#x02013; wAMT6 (<italic>TGACv1_473845_AA1533160.1</italic>), wAMT7 (<italic>TGACv1_501472_AA1617880.1</italic>), and wAMT8 (<italic>TGACv1_527195_AA1700270.1</italic>) &#x02013; located on chromosomes 6AL, 6BL, and 6DL respectively, were grouped together (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These three genes are most similar with three others &#x02013; wAMT1, wAMT3, and wAMT9 &#x02013; of which wAMT1 and wAMT3 are located on 2AL and 2BL respectively whereas wAMT9 has not been assigned to a chromosome. Their placement was not unexpected as all these genes were annotated to the <italic>ammonium transporter 1</italic> (<italic>AMT1</italic>) family. Similarly for wNRT, a group of 16 genes (wNRT40&#x02013;41, 181, 183, 208, 210&#x02013;218, 234, and 247) located on chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D neighbored each other and belonged to the <italic>nitrate transporter 1</italic> (<italic>NRT1</italic>) family (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Dataset). Although most wAMT and wNRT homeolog genes clustered together, not all groupings conformed to this configuration. An example is the placing of wAMT genes 49&#x02013;52 where wAMT49 and wAMT50 are located on 4DS whereas wAMT51 and wAMT52 are located on 5BL and 5DL, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Similar observation was made also for wNRT sequences where genes 52&#x02013;54 belonging to chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D were placed closely with genes 46&#x02013;50 belonging to chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D with high posterior probability score (&#x0003e;0.8). Because of the large number of wNRT genes used in drawing the tree, these groupings are not possible to show in the figure; this data is available in Supplementary Dataset.</p><p id="Par19">Expression patterns of homeologous wAMT and wNRT genes in root and shoot tissues of all lines were mostly similar, with few exceptions.

Similarly, wAMT17 (<italic>TGACv1_405370_AA1325990.1</italic>), located on 5BL, was expressed more in root of all lines whereas wAMT18 (<italic>TGACv1_433945_AA1425980.1</italic>), located on 5DL, was not expressed (Supplementary Dataset). For wheat nitrate transporters, expression of wNRT130&#x02013;134 (all located on 6A and 6B) was virtually non-existent in roots of all lines relative to that of wNRT135&#x02013;137 (located on 6D). Expression of wNRT92 (<italic>TGACv1_471614_AA1511800.1</italic>) (located on 6A) was higher in shoot of all lines relative to that of wNRT96 (<italic>TGACv1_502018_AA1622420.1</italic>) (6B) and wNRT97 (<italic>TGACv1_526485_AA1685000.1</italic>) (6D).

We observed that such relationships among the wAMT and wNRT genes mostly resulted in grouping of similar genes and gene families.</p><p id="Par22">The number of AMT and NRT genes detected in this study is higher when compared to wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> as well as in other plant species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and poplar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. One explanation could be the derivation of several copies of wAMT and wNRT genes from a handful of ancestral genes, as seen from duplicated and multiplicated AMT and NRT genes, predicted by MEGA. Specifically, 8 gene duplications were observed among the wheat AMT genes and AMT genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, maize, and rice; and this number was 77 for the NRT genes (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Wheat has a highly repetitive genome derived from inter-species hybridization of three diploid progenitors that occurred &#x0003c;1 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Differences in rates of nucleotide substitution, polyploidization, and overall rates of evolution have been observed in plant species of different ploidy levels, including grasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, variability in mechanisms used for structural changes in the genome such as gene duplications and inversions&#x000a0;are to be expected in a crop with a complex genome such as wheat, as detected by MEGA. Another possible reason is because wheat genome is massively large at approximately 16 giga base pairs and contains over 110,000 genes (ensembl.org), which is more than 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;the number of genes in rice or poplar. Perhaps the most convincing argument is the fact that wheat has three homeologous sub-genomes which could harbor additional copies of transporter genes, as they have been known to carry multiple copies of several genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. From a technical perspective, the availability of high-quality gene&#x000a0;sequences could also have had a significant role in helping us uncover a comprehensive set of AMT and NRT genes in wheat.</p><p id="Par23">As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, most AMT genes clustered with each other. Two other groups &#x02013;&#x000a0;putative ammonium transporter and symbiotic ammonium transporter &#x02013; also formed distinct groups. Often, the resolved groups had genes from the same group of chromosomes. For example, genes belonging to 1A, 1B, 1D or 4A, 4B, 4D were organized among each other, probably owing to higher homeology among the protein sequences of genes in each group of chromosomes. This was also found to be true in the case of nodes with low (&#x0003c;0.2) posterior probability values. As the number of annotated AMT genes in wheat remains small, identification of several AMT genes based on sequence homology to other plant species, of which some are reported here&#x000a0;for the first time, should contribute towards identification of even more AMT genes in wheat and their utilization in plant breeding.</p><p id="Par24">Phylogenetic relationships among the NRT genes also showed similar trends as alike genes were grouped together (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The NRT genes are mainly divided into three categories: &#x02018;<italic>NRT1</italic> (recently named as <italic>NPF</italic> (<italic>NRT1/ PTR FAMILY</italic>)), <italic>NRT2</italic> (&#x02018;high-affinity&#x02019; genes), and <italic>NRT3</italic> (recently named as <italic>NAR</italic>). We annotated our Bayesian phylogenetic tree with 5 clades of which clade V, the most evolutionarily distant clade, constituted of high-affinity <italic>NRT2</italic> and <italic>NRT3</italic> (<italic>NAR2</italic>) wheat genes. The remaining clades constituted of low-affinity transporters from <italic>NRT1</italic> family - which have been now designated as <italic>NPFX.Y</italic> in the new nomenclature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>- and mostly resolved into several smaller groups based on the gene families. As seen in Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, some known genes overlap across different clades (example: <italic>NPF6.1</italic>). This was indeed true for both wAMT and wNRT genes where distribution of non-similar genes among multiple branches was observed. One explanation for this is that the protein coding motifs of different wAMT/wNRT genes are similar enough to represent the same gene during <italic>blastx</italic> search. Another explanation is that a gene being positioned in different clades simply suggests that the wAMT/wNRT sequences with which they are associated with could have different sequences and therefore are different from each other; yet based on the <italic>blastx</italic> hits, depending on the similarity %, are still the same. Exploring the relationships among ammonium and nitrate transporters of different species have been reported before, and is not new to wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, the close associations of wAMT and wNRT genes with ammonium and nitrate uptake genes in other plant species shown in our work are expected to yield similar functions in wheat.</p><p id="Par25">We also used root and shoot transcriptome from five wheat lines &#x02013; Glenlea, Red Fife, Ruby, Stoa, and Sumai3 in order to uncover differentially expressed AMT and NRT genes between root and shoot during early growth stages of wheat. We used two R packages &#x02013; edgeR and NOISeq for DEG detection. Majority of the genes we found using edgeR were also confirmed by NOISeq results, and <italic>vice-versa</italic>. The residual differences in DEG detection between the two packages are to be expected because they follow different approaches during DEG analysis. The biggest point of contrast between the two is their underlying assumption of transcript abundance: edgeR assumes a negative binomial distribution of the read counts whereas NOISeq adapts to the data on a nonparametric method. Another difference we observed was how genes with 0 reads or count per million (cpm) reads were handled. In edgeR, the cpm values are taken and processed as-is for DEG detection whereas NOISeq replaces genes with cpm&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 with a user-determined value. These led to differences in detection as well as in lack of detection of some genes during the comparative analysis. Choice of the appropriate program is therefore a function of number of available biological and technical replicates, handling of missing data, and the presumed read distribution. Depending on the dataset used for analysis, both methods are known to show varying results in terms of number of genes detected, false discoveries, and precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Across all lines, 8 wAMT genes were differentially expressed of which four were common in all lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, 7 of the 8 DEGs were located in group 6 chromosomes and one was located on 5B. It is also worth noting that all 8 wAMT genes were located on long arms of their respective chromosomes. It has been previously shown that <italic>TaAMT1;1</italic> is located on 2BL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> yet the authors report that this gene could also belong to 2AL, 2BL, or 6DL. In our study, the wAMT gene <italic>TGACv1_527195_AA1700270.1</italic> was located on 6D and found to be identical with <italic>TaAMT1;1</italic> (GenBank accession <italic>AAS19466.2</italic>) with full-length alignment of 503&#x02009;bp and e-value of 0 (Supplementary Dataset). Therefore, we can predict with high confidence that one copy of <italic>TaAMT1;1</italic> is definitively located on 6DL of wheat. As previously discussed, the wheat AMT genes are poorly studied and the genomic locations of all wheat AMTs are unknown. In this study, we have uncovered 57 wheat AMT genes. We hope that our discovery adds to the annotation effort of the wheat transcriptome. Simultaneously, using these reported sequences in validation of wAMT genes could help understand their functions and pave the path to use them in breeding.</p><p id="Par27">The 52 differentially expressed wNRT genes were identified in all chromosomes except in 2A, 3A, and 3B. Buchner and Hawkesford<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> have reported the presence of the seven NPF families in all 21 wheat chromosomes. In particular, chromosome 2A contains <italic>TaNPF2.3</italic> and <italic>TaNPF6.7</italic>; and both 3A and 3B contain <italic>TaNPF1.1</italic>, <italic>TaNPF2.4</italic>, and <italic>TaNPF2.5</italic>. As these genes were detected during <italic>blastx</italic>-search (Supplementary Dataset, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), it is possible that they were not differentially expressed between root and shoot tissues in the lines used in our experiment. We found that <italic>TaNRT2</italic> (GenBank accession <italic>AAG01172.1</italic>) was highly similar with 10 genes located in chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D of which five genes, all located on 6AS, were differentially expressed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>); Buchner and Hawkesford (2014) did not observe any transporter family 2 genes on group 6 chromosomes. A handful of genes, including low-affinity nitrate transporter genes, that were initially detected in tissues of adult barley plants by Kohl <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, were also observed in our wheat seedlings.

Also, our discovery suggests that not all nitrate transporter genes may be expressed in a wheat plant during its early stages.</p><p id="Par28">Tissue-specific expression of several wAMT and wNRT DEGs were congruent with previous studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Another example was the <italic>HvPTR1</italic>-like low-affinity nitrate transporter gene (GenBank accession <italic>CCJ47250.1</italic>) reported by Kohl <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> in barley shoot tissue (flag leaf, glumes, and grains) during seed development. This gene was similar to <italic>TGACv1_177275_AA0571880.2</italic> (wNRT433) on chromosome 2D and was found to be expressed highly in shoot tissue of all five lines. This indicates that this gene is mostly active in the shoot and is involved in acquiring nitrate from the roots.</p><p id="Par29">Several wAMT and wNRT genes also exhibited differential expression patterns in previously published studies, which we uncovered by aligning these genes with wheat RNA-seq transcripts from those studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (Supplementary Dataset). For instance, the wNRT genes <italic>TGACv1_392635_AA1262450.1</italic> (<italic>AtNRT1.5</italic>) decreased in transcript abundance post-anthesis flag leaf whereas genes <italic>TGACv1_471614_AA1511800.2</italic> (<italic>AtNAR2.2</italic>) and <italic>TGACv1_423416_AA1376380.1</italic> (<italic>AtNPF2.11</italic>) increased in abundance on post-anthesis flag leaf.

We mostly observed that the overall expression of the wAMT and wNRT genes in these studies did not follow a strict pattern, implying that expression is a function of genotype as well as conditional differences. Nearly all the genes expressed in these datasets were also present in our study, suggestive of a comprehensive compilation of wheat AMT and NRT transcripts in wheat seedlings despite being a single-point capture. Although we discovered these genes in 21-days-old wheat seedlings, their detection in previously published datasets that studied adult wheat plants emphasizes their importance in all plant growth stages.</p><p id="Par30">Lastly, we would also like to highlight few genes that were undetected during DEG analysis (largely due to filtering parameters) but had interesting expression patterns. Seventeen wNRT genes in 11 chromosomes were not expressed in either root or shoot of the five lines; 9 of these 17 genes are annotated as putative low-affinity nitrate transporters (Supplementary Dataset). Forty-two genes did not express in roots of any of the five lines, of which three were identified as DEGs in shoot of all five lines. Similarly, 72 genes were completely absent in shoot. Of these 72, 17 were identified as DEGs in the roots of which 15 were highly expressed in all five lines. In case of wAMT genes, we did not find genes that were not expressed in the roots. However, 14 wAMT genes were not expressed in shoot of any line of which three were identified as DEGs (Supplementary Dataset). Additionally, several sets of homeologous genes exhibited differential expression that were generally tissue-specific. The genes in these sets contained several polymorphisms and indels among their alignments (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). While the differences among the homeologous sequence pairs might be rendering each gene different function relative to others, a definitive statement cannot be made with the amount of data we have. Our group is currently conducting a follow-up study to understand involvement of genes when different N levels are supplied to the wheat plant in controlled environment as well as in the field. Upon completion of this project, we hope to uncover the relationship among these tissue-specific non-expressed and highly expressed genes in wheat seedlings with adult wheat plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Creation of a &#x02018;pseudo reference&#x02019; containing wheat AMT and NRT genes</title><p id="Par31">One of the main objectives of this study was to assemble the hexaploid wheat complement of ammonium transporter (AMT) and nitrate transporter (NRT) genes.

Tissues for RNA extraction were flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored in &#x02212;80&#x000b0; C until RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Whole transcriptome sequencing</title><p id="Par34">Total RNA from root and shoot tissue was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). The RNA was treated with DNaseI (Promega, Madison, WI), cleaned using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), and checked for quality and quantity using BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). For each line, equal amount of RNA from three replicates of root tissues were pooled together and three replicates of shoot tissues were pooled together to create cDNA libraries. The libraries were created following Illumina&#x02019;s instructions, multiplexed (10 samples in one lane), and sequenced on Illumina&#x02019;s HiSeq 2500 using the 100&#x02009;bp paired-end protocol. Obtained sequences were filtered for minimum phred quality score (Q) of 20 followed by adapter and barcode trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.36, and assigned to the corresponding sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p id="Par35">Indexing of both wAMT and wNRT genes was conducted using the <italic>index</italic> command in kallisto 0.43.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Alignment of the sequenced paired end transcripts to wAMT and wNRT genes was also done in kallisto (<italic>quant</italic> command) with 100 bootstrapping of the input reads. The resulting alignment counts were further analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> package in R 3.3.1 using a false discovery rate (FDR) of &#x0003c;0.001. A second R package, NOISeq, was used with recommended threshold (q) of 0.9 to cross validate the results from edgeR. NOISeq is a nonparametric approach to identify differentially expressed genes in samples without technical replications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. For DEG analysis in both methods, in-root expression was compared with in-shoot expression within each line. Assigning definite physiological functions to the DEGs on an individual basis is a difficult task and is outside the scope of our work. Therefore, a holistic gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out to obtain a snapshot of the general functions of these genes. DEGs were categorized into GO slim categories using the method of Hu <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>qRT-PCR validation of DEGs</title><p id="Par36">RNA-seq results were further evaluated by performing qPCR on 9 DEGs that were expressed highly in either root or in shoot tissues. Because we saw similar expression trends in the RNA-seq results across all five lines, only Glenlea and Red Fife were used in qRT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of total RNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Expression of genes was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The analysis was carried out using three biological replicates per tissue per line. For internal control, the housekeeping genes Actin and &#x003b2;-tubulin were used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.
