    "BACKGROUND:Selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient in both animals and humans, has various biological functions, and its deficiency can lead to various diseases. The most common method for increasing Se uptake is the consumption of Se-rich plants, which transform inorganic Se into organic forms. Wheat is eaten daily by many people. The Se content of Aegilops tauschii (Ae. tauschii), one of the ancestors of hexaploid common wheat, is generally higher than that of wheat. In this study, two genotypes of Ae. tauschii with contrasting Se-accumulating abilities were subjected to different Se treatments followed by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS:Sequencing of 12 transcriptome libraries of Ae. tauschii grown under different Se treatments produced about a total of 47.72â€‰GB of clean reads. After filtering out rRNA sequences, approximately 19.3 million high-quality clean reads were mapped to the reference genome (ta IWGSC_MIPSv2.1 genome DA). The total number of reference genome gene is 32,920 and about 26,407 known genes were detected in four groups. Functional annotation of these mapped genes revealed a large number of genes and some pivotal pathways that may participate in Se metabolism. The expressions of several genes potentially involved in Se metabolism were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS:Our study, the first to examine Se metabolism in Ae. tauschii, has provided a theoretical foundation for future elucidation of the mechanism of Se metabolism in this species."
