    "In the majority of wheat growing areas worldwide, the incidence of drought stress has increased significantly resulting in a negative impact on plant development and grain yield. Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is known to improve drought stress tolerance of wheat. However, quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in the response to drought stress conditions in the presence of mycorrhizae are largely unknown. Therefore, a diverse set consisting of 94 bread wheat genotypes was phenotyped under drought stress and well watered conditions in the presence and absence of mycorrhizae. Grain yield and yield components, drought stress related traits as well as response to mycorrhizae were assessed. In parallel, wheat accessions were genotyped by using the 90k iSelect chip, resulting in a set of 15511 polymorphic and mapped SNP markers, which were used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In general, drought stress tolerance of wheat was significantly increased in the presence of mycorrhizae compared to drought stress tolerance in the absence of mycorrhizae. However, genotypes differed in their response to mycorrhizae under drought stress conditions. Several QTL regions on different chromosomes were detected associated with grain yield and yield components under drought stress conditions. Furthermore, two genome regions on chromosomes 3D and 7D were found to be significantly associated with the response to mycorrhizae under drought stress conditions. Overall, the results reveal that inoculation of wheat with mycorrhizal fungi significantly improves drought stress tolerance and that QTL regions associated with the response to mycorrhizae under drought stress conditions exist in wheat. Further research is necessary to validate detected QTL regions. However, this study may be the starting point for the identification of candidate genes associated with drought stress tolerance and response to mycorrhizae under drought stress conditions. Maybe in future, these initial results will help to contribute to use mycorrhizal fungi effectively in agriculture and combine new approaches i.e., use of genotypic variation in response to mycorrhizae under drought stress conditions with existing drought tolerance breeding programs to develop new drought stress tolerant genotypes."
