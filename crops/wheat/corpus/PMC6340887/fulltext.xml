In addition to anatomical adaptations such as development of roots, vascular systems and cuticle-coated epidermal layers with stomata for efficient water usage, land plants also developed signal transduction systems for sensing and responding to water-deficient conditions. Osmostress-responsive accumulation of the phytohormone ABA triggers responses such as stomatal closure, and accumulation of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and soluble sugars that protect cellular functions from dehydration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. ABA signalling acts through protein phosphorylation via SnRK2 kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These are classified in three subclasses (I&#x02013;III)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and the subclass III SnRK2s are an essential component for ABA signal transduction regulated by soluble ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) and Group A protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2CAs) in angiosperms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. PP2CAs of Arabidopsis negatively regulate ABA signalling by inhibiting subclass III SnRK2 activity through direct interaction. The inhibition is cancelled when ABA binds to PYR/PYL/RCAR, which specifically sequester the PP2CAs, facilitating SnRK2 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. SnRK2s are also activated by osmostress. Disruption of all three subclasses in Arabidopsis results in a loss of osmostress responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, it is yet to be elucidated how ABA-nonresponsive SnRK2 (subclass I) is regulated through osmostress.</p><p id="Par4">Although SnRK2s are evolutionarily conserved among land plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, our knowledge of SnRK2 functions in non-angiosperms is limited. The genome of the model moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> encodes only four <italic>SnRK2</italic> genes (<italic>PpSnRK2A</italic>&#x02009;/&#x02009;<italic>2B</italic>&#x02009;/&#x02009;<italic>2</italic><italic>C</italic>&#x02009;/&#x02009;<italic>2D</italic>), all of which belong to subclass III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. <italic>PpSnRK2A/ Pp OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1)</italic> restores ABA responsiveness of stomatal closure in the Arabidopsis <italic>snrk2.6/ost1</italic> mutant, and disruption of <italic>PpSnRK2A/PpOST1</italic> results in defective ABA-responsive closure of moss stomata, which occur only at the base of sporophytes, the non-dominant generation in bryophytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, it is not known whether the <italic>Ppsnrk2a/Ppost1</italic> plant also has a defect in the ABA responsiveness of the moss protonemata, where ABA responses as well as tolerance to desiccation and osmostress have been well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Our previous studies have highlighted the differential regulation of ABA signalling between <italic>P. patens</italic> and Arabidopsis. We have shown that PP2CAs of <italic>P. patens</italic> play a major role in repressing ABA signalling downstream of the 40&#x02009;kDa ABA-activated kinases, suggesting a novel mechanism to regulate the kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, we identified a novel ABA-activated Raf-like kinase (ARK), also known as ABA NON-RESPONSIVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1-LIKE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, that acts upstream of the 40&#x02009;kDa ABA-activated kinases and is essential for ABA responses in <italic>P. patens</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, to understand the function of SnRK2s in bryophytes, we establish <italic>Ppsnrk2</italic> null mutants of <italic>P. patens</italic> using sequential gene targeting. We show that a high level of osmostress tolerance in <italic>P. patens</italic> is achieved exclusively through an ABA&#x02013;SnRK2 signalling module. The highly conserved motif in the activation loop of land plant subclass III SnRK2s, which is the phosphorylation target of ARK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, plays a crucial role in SnRK2 activation. A cross-species complementation assay demonstrates that a <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene from the semiterrestrial alga <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic>, which contains all the components of ABA signalling except ABA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> can complement <italic>Ppsnrk2</italic> mutants. We propose that the ABA/ARK/subclass III SnRK2 signalling module is an ancestral feature that enabled the colonization of land by simple plants, which subsequently recruited ABA to modulate the dehydration response before the separation of bryophytes and vascular plants. Subsequently, vascular plants further developed a novel subclass I SnRK2 signalling module for osmostress tolerance independent of the ABA-ARK system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Role of SnRK2 in ABA- and osmostress responses of <italic>P. patens</italic></title><p id="Par6">We established <italic>Ppsnrk2</italic> null mutants of <italic>P. patens</italic> using sequential gene targeting of the <italic>Ppsnrk2a (Ppost1</italic>) plant (SKO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> to generate the <italic>Ppsnrk2a/b</italic> double knockout (DKO), the <italic>Ppsnrk2a/b/c</italic> triple knockout (TKO), and two independent <italic>Ppsnrk2a/b/c/d</italic> quadruple knockouts (QKOs; line #3 and #7) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1a</xref>).

To confirm the identity of the kinase activity, proteins extracted from ABA- or mannitol-treated protonemata of wild-type and <italic>Ppsnrk2</italic> disruptants were subjected to the in-gel kinase assay (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). A decrease of kinase activity correlated with the number of disrupted genes, QKO plants showing little kinase activity after treatments. These results strongly support identification of the 40&#x02009;kDa kinases as PpSnRK2s. ABA responses of <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemata were also adversely affected in the <italic>SnRK2</italic> disruptants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Growth of wild-type protonemata is effectively repressed by ABA treatment, with structural changes leading to the formation of thick-walled spherical brood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Even with ABA concentration increased to 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, few brood cells were observed in QKO plants <bold>(</bold>Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref><bold>)</bold><italic>.

We confirmed the lack of expression of several <italic>LEA</italic> genes in QKO plants in response to ABA by RNA gel blot analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). We further investigated the accumulation of boiling-soluble proteins, which is a feature of hydrophilic LEA proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Exogenous ABA and mannitol-induced osmostress caused accumulation of boiling-soluble proteins in wild-type, but not in QKO plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody to 17B9 (Pp3c23_13700V3.1), a LEA-like protein associated with the osmostress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> confirmed this (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). We then evaluated the osmostress tolerance of QKO plants. We dehydrated protonemal cells in an atmosphere of 97% RH (corresponding to &#x02212;4 MPa water potential) for 50, 75, and 100&#x02009;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). As previously reported, this treatment reduces water content of the protonemata to about 60 (50&#x02009;h), 45 (75&#x02009;h), and 40% (100&#x02009;h), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These protonemata were rehydrated and then recovered on normal medium. Both QKO plants and the <italic>ark</italic> mutant survived dehydration for 50&#x02009;h like wild-type plants, suggesting that PpSnRK2s and ARK are not essential for mild (60% water content) dehydration stress-tolerance. By contrast, whereas wild-type plants survived 75&#x02013;100&#x02009;h of dehydration, the QKO plants and the <italic>ark</italic> mutant did not. QKO plants were also hypersensitive to osmotic stress. Protonemata of QKO as well as the <italic>ark</italic> mutant could not survive after culture on medium containing 1&#x02009;M mannitol (&#x02212;2.5&#x02009;MPa) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Furthermore, when wild-type protonemata were subjected to osmoshock by exposure to a moderate concentration of 0.4&#x02009;M mannitol solution for 15&#x02009;min, the majority of cells survived, as judged by Evans blue staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>), whereas most protonemal cells of the QKO plants did not survive this treatment. We also compared osmoshock tolerance of QKO with both ABA-deficient transgenic <italic>P. patens</italic> (<italic>ppaba1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and the <italic>ark</italic> mutant. The ABA-deficient mutant and to a lesser extent the <italic>ark</italic> mutant was tolerant to this treatment; however, QKO was not. This suggests that an additional ABA- and ARK- independent SnRK2 function also enables wild-type cells to withstand osmoshock. It is possible that even without osmostress PpSnRK2 might be slightly activated through unknown upstream kinase(s) or by autophosphorylation. Nevertheless, QKO protonemata were susceptible even to mild osmoshock imposed by 0.35&#x02009;M mannitol; however, if pretreated with a non-detrimental osmostress (0.1&#x02009;M mannitol) for 12&#x02009;h, they acquired tolerance to 0.35&#x02009;M mannitol (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). In contrast, ABA-pretreatment did not recover the osmotolerance of QKO protonemata, indicating that osmostress acclimation of <italic>P. patens</italic> involves an ABA- and SnRK2-independent system. Analysis of <italic>Ppsnrk2a/b/d</italic> TKO plants showed these to have ABA sensitivity comparable with wild-type (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2e</xref>). Moreover, introduction of <italic>PpSnRK2A</italic> or -<italic>D</italic> sequences under the constitutive <italic>actin</italic> promoter was sufficient to complement the QKO mutant phenotype, restoring ABA sensitivity to protonemata (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>PpSnRK2</italic> genes are functionally redundant and play a major role in protonemal ABA signalling. Our data clearly demonstrated the essential role of SnRK2 in ABA signalling as well as in dehydration tolerance of the moss protonemata.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>SnRK2 in global gene expression and protein phosphorylation</title><p id="Par9">To investigate the effect of <italic>SnRK2</italic> disruption on global gene expression we used RNA-seq analysis of wild-type and QKO plants treated with 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M ABA (12&#x02009;h) or subjected to osmostress with 0.4&#x02009;M mannitol (12&#x02009;h) (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The RNA-seq data were verified by qPCR analysis of the response of signature ABA/stress-response genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In wild-type plants, 16,924 genes were represented by more than five mapped reads per transcript. Of these 2187 were significantly (&#x0003e;2 fold with a false discovery rate with <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05) upregulated and 2880 were down-regulated by ABA treatment. Osmotic stress resulted in 1028 genes being significantly upregulated and 1595 down-regulated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). The majority of osmostress-responsive genes overlapped with ABA-responsive genes, suggesting that osmostress-induced ABA accumulation is responsible for these expression patterns. The number of ABA-responsive genes was greatly reduced in QKO plants whereas that of osmostress-responsive genes was relatively normal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Principal component analysis of gene expression profiles in QKO plants indicated that the effect of <italic>PpSnRK2</italic> disruption appeared most prominently in the ABA response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), as was also indicated by scatter plots of gene expression of QKO vs wild-type after ABA treatment (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0378) compared to that of osmostress treatment (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6108) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). We found a significant number of genes that were affected only by osmostress in wild-type (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). Interestingly, expression of these genes was scarcely affected by disruption of <italic>SnRK2</italic>. This cohort of ABA- and SnRK2-independent osmostress responsive genes represent candidate components of the osmostress acclimation process. It is noteworthy that RNA-seq analysis also demonstrated that the expression of many genes, including <italic>LEA</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4b</xref>), were more drastically reduced in the QKO mutant than in the wild-type, under normal conditions. This may partly explain the reason for the hypersensitivity of QKO plants following osmoshock (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Transcriptomic analysis of PpSnRK2 downstream factors. <bold>a</bold> Numbers of ABA-regulated genes and osmostress-regulated genes in wild-type (WT), and the numbers of genes affected in QKO plants.

The SAGs were also upregulated by typical dehydration-related stresses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Functional categorization of SAGs, by gene ontology term enrichment analysis revealed that SnRK2s are involved mainly in abiotic stress responses and energy metabolism (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We compared our transcriptomic data with that of the <italic>ark</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> for ABA-responsive genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). Most ARK-regulated genes (91% for ABA-induced and 77% for ABA-repressed) were included in SnRK2-regulated genes, indicating the major role of the ABA/ARK/SnRK2 module in the regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression. To investigate the overlap between responses of SnRK2-regulated gene expression in <italic>P. patens</italic> and Arabidopsis, we analysed transcriptomic data for the Arabidopsis <italic>srk2dei</italic> mutant, which lacks subclass III SnRK2, deposited in ArrayExpress (E-MEXP-3713;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4d</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We found that about 20% of Arabidopsis subclass III-regulated ABA responsive genes were orthologues of <italic>P. patens</italic> SnRK2-regulated, ABA-responsive genes. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis of the overlapping gene sets showed enrichment of stress responsive genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4e</xref>), indicating SnRK2 function to be evolutionarily conserved in regulating stress responses of land plants. We also investigated genes with fewer than 5 mapped reads in any samples, which were removed from analyses described above. These genes also contained a significant number of ABA- and SnRK2-regulated genes such as <italic>LEA</italic> genes (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5a</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Gene ontology term enrichment analysis of these genes resulted in a similar pattern with that of SAGs (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5b</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">In addition to the RNA-seq analysis, we performed phosphoproteome analysis to investigate the effect of <italic>SnRK2</italic> deletion on ABA-responsive protein phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We detected 3789 unique phosphopeptides in protonemal proteins prepared from wild-type and QKO treated with or without ABA. Of these, 760 showed significant differences between the wild-type and QKO, and principal component analysis demonstrated that disruption of PpSnRK2 greatly affected the phosphoproteome profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In wild-type plants, 498 phosphopeptides showed a more than 3-fold change in abundance after ABA treatment in at least two of the three biological replicates. In QKO plants, 138 (27.8%) of the 498 ABA-responsive phosphopeptides (corresponding to 105 unique proteins) were lower in abundance (1/3-fold compared to wild-type) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Amagai et al. reported through the phosphoproteomic analysis of the <italic>ark</italic> mutant that ARK regulated 126 (88.1 %) of the 143 ABA-responsive phosphopeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We compared the ARK-regulated ABA-responsive phosphopeptides with the 138 ABA-responsive phosphopeptides regulated by PpSnRK2. The result showed that 24 proteins were commonly regulated by ARK and SnRK2, which included an ABA-responsive bZIP transcription factor (ABF)-related protein (Pp3c20_7230V3.2.p). Examples of these ABA-responsive phosphorylation profiles between wild-type and QKO are shown (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). An in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed to confirm whether SnRK2 could phosphorylate selected phosphopeptides identified in this study. We chose 3 phosphopeptides from the list of PpSnRK2-regulated phosphopeptides and one phosphopeptide which is not included in the list, then these peptides were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation assay by PpSnRK2B (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Our data demonstrated that two peptides derived from a kinesin motor protein and a serine/threonine-protein kinase as well as a positive control peptide derived from a sucrose-phosphate synthase, which was shown to be phosphorylated by PpSnRK2B in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, were strongly phosphorylated by PpSnRK2B, confirming that our phosphoproteomic data involved SnRK2 substrates. On the other hand, a PpSnRK2-regulated phosphopeptide from phototropin was only weakly phosphorylated to a similar extent with that of a phosphopeptide not regulated by PpSnRK2 derived from a calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA), suggesting that the phototropin may not be directly phosphorylated by PpSnRK2. It has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis that ABFs are SnRK2 substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and four ABF transcription factors (ABF1, ABF2, ABF3, and ABF4) are the master regulators for SnRK2-activated ABA-responsive transcription in vegetative tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Our analysis in <italic>P. patens</italic> detected a conserved, ABA-responsive, SnRK2-dependent phosphopeptide NFGpSMNMDEFLK in a bZIP transcription factor, which is also found in the C1 domain of Arabidopsis ABFs and which is known to be phosphorylated by Arabidopsis subclass III SnRK2 in an ABA-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that ARK and SnRK2 together regulate ABA signalling through phosphorylation of ABFs in <italic>P. patens</italic> and that the core ABA phosphosignalling is evolutionarily conserved between bryophytes and angiosperms. The Motif-X algorithm detected four motifs; [&#x02013;R&#x02013;x&#x02013;x&#x02013;pS&#x02013;], [&#x02013;pS&#x02013;P&#x02013;], [&#x02013;pS&#x02013;x&#x02013;S&#x02013;] and [&#x02013;S&#x02013;x&#x02013;pS] from the phosphopeptides enhanced in response to ABA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The motif [&#x02013;R&#x02013;x&#x02013;x&#x02013;pS&#x02013;] was the only sequence common to both ABA-enhanced and SnRK2-dependent datasets. This motif was also identified as a phosphorylation target motif of Arabidopsis subclass III SnRK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, representing the evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation preference in subclass III SnRK2 in land plants. We also detected the [&#x02013;pS&#x02013;P&#x02013;] motif in SnRK2-independent ABA-responsive phosphopeptides. This motif is a minimal mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) target motif, suggesting an involvement of MAPK cascade in ABA signalling of the moss, as demonstrated in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The [&#x02013;pS/pT&#x02013;x&#x02013;S&#x02013;] and [&#x02013;S&#x02013;x&#x02013;pS/pT&#x02013;] motifs were not detected in previous phosphoproteome analyses of Arabidopsis SnRK2 or of <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> ARK, suggesting that these motifs are species-specific recognition motifs of SnRK2 in the moss and represent differences in ABA-responsive phosphosignaling between bryophytes and angiosperms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that there were only three overlaps of SnRK2-regulated proteins between <italic>P. patens</italic> and Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> {AT3G13300/Pp3c15_3450V3.1.p (varicose); AT3G57150/Pp3c22_190V3.1.p (putative pseudouridine synthase NAP57); AT1G49720.1/ Pp3c20_7230V3.2.p (ABF1 abscisic acid responsive element-binding factor 1)}. This observation may imply the differential evolution of ABA-responsive phosphosignalling downstream of SnRK2 after the separation of bryophytes and vascular plants, as suggested in the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, 360 peptides were phosphorylated in response to ABA in QKO plants, suggesting the presence of an alternative, SnRK2-independent, phosphorylation cascade(s) in response to ABA.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Phosphoproteomic analysis of <italic>P. patens</italic> WT and <italic>Ppsnrk2</italic> QKO plants. <bold>a</bold> Principal component analysis of quantitative data of phosphopeptides from wild-type (WT) and QKO plants under ABA treatment. <bold>b</bold> A Venn diagram of two phosphopeptide groups; one is the ABA-responsive (upregulated) group in WT, and the other is the SnRK2-dependent group.

The core sequence <underline>S</underline>QPK<underline>S</underline> is evolutionarily conserved among subclass III SnRK2s, but it has been changed to S[K/R/N/M]PKS in subclass I SnRK2s (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). To confirm the importance of the conserved <underline>S</underline>QPK<underline>S</underline> motif for the subclass III SnRK2 activation, we introduced mutations into PpSnRK2D to change the consensus sequence to the subclass I-type and monitored activity using an endogenous ABA-responsive <italic>PpLEA1</italic> promoter (<italic>PpLEA1-GUS</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). The single mutation of Gln to either Met or Asn significantly reduced the activation of <italic>PpLEA1-GUS</italic>.

The mutated versions of PpSnRK2D all showed reduced activity in response to osmostress, comparable with the reductions in ABA-responsiveness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). We further confirmed the importance of the SQPKS motif in vitro. PpSnRK2D with or without mutations fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the kinase domain of ARK fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and affinity-purified proteins were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation assay.

Thus the evolutionarily conserved motif in the activation loop of subclass III SnRK2s is important for the ABA-dependent activation of the kinase through ARK. Since we observed partly different effects of the mutations between the in vitro phosphorylation assay and the in vivo functional assay, it is possible that unknown factor(s) such as a protein phosphatase is involved in the regulation of phosphorylation status of the motif.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>ABA-activated SnRK2 activity of <italic>P. patens</italic> depends on the evolutionarily conserved ARK phosphorylation motif in the activation loop. <bold>a</bold> Protonemata of wild-type (WT) or transgenic plants expressing SnRK2B-GFP or mutated SnRK2-GFP (S165/169&#x02009;A) under the control of the rice <italic>actin</italic> promoter were treated with or without 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;M ABA for the indicated periods in minutes, then the protein extracts were subjected to in-gel kinase assay.

Moreover, Arabidopsis SnRK2.8 and 2.6 transformants restored the ABA sensitivity and osmotolerance of QKO mutant plants, whereas Subclass I SnRK2s did not (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">9</xref>a and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">9</xref><xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">b</xref>). Thus, these data suggested that the system for osmostress activation of SnRK2 subclasses II and III is evolutionarily conserved between the bryophyte and Arabidopsis, whereas the bryophyte does not possess the necessary upstream and/or downstream factors for subclass I SnRK2s to function in osmostress responses. Our result also agreed well with the previous report that the activation mechanism of Arabidopsis subclass III SnRK2 by osmostress is different from that of subclass I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par15">Our results show the fundamental role of SnRK2 in ABA signalling as well as in osmostress and dehydration tolerance (including desiccation) of <italic>P. patens</italic>, an extant member of a basal land plant lineage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that even an algal SnRK2 from the evolutionarily distant charophyte, <italic>K. nitens</italic>, is functionally equivalent to that of land plants in executing ABA signalling, clearly identifying that the origins of SnRK2-mediated responses predate the evolution of land plants. Previous reports suggest that subclass III SnRK2 is the prototype of the SnRK2 family and that SnRK2 subclasses I and II evolved after separation of bryophytes and vascular plants, with the former representing the most recent form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of the increased genome information from evolutionarily distant plant species such as charophycean algae and gymnosperms, we provided further insights into <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene family evolution by a survey of <italic>SnRK2</italic> genes from published genome sequences and expressed sequence tags from algae and land plants (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">10&#x02013;14</xref>). All the charophycean algae investigated so far (but none of the chlorophytes) possess only a single <italic>SnRK2</italic> gene that belongs to subclass III (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">10</xref>). In bryophytes, the mosses <italic>Sphagnum fallax</italic> and <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, and the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, also have only subclass III <italic>SnRK2</italic> genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">11</xref>). The other subclasses of <italic>SnRK2</italic> are detected only in vascular plants (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">12</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Thus it is likely that the precursor of the <italic>SnRK2</italic> genes (subclass III-type) arose before the evolution of land plants, and that gene duplication and subfunctionalisation (the emergence of subclasses I and II) occurred after the separation of bryophytes and vascular plants (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">14</xref>). The land plants are monophyletic in origin, indicating descent from a single successful colonisation of the terrestrial environment by an aquatic ancestor within the charophyte algae approximately 500 million years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Phylogenomic analyses have supported the identification of either the Charales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> or the Zygnematales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> as sister to the land plants, with the argument provided by Wickett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> favouring the Zygnematales currently the most convincing, based as it is on phylogenetic reconstruction from the extensive sequence data generated in the 1000 plants programme. A number of extant charophyte species occupy semiterrestrial habitats, supporting the hypothesis that the successful colonisation of land derived from algal adaptations that enabled these anatomically simple algae to survive the challenging environmental conditions encountered on land<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Bryophytes are thought to be the most ancient extant land plant lineages, and the ability to tolerate dehydration must have been a key trait enabling successful colonization of land, and in land plants this trait is regulated by ABA. Significantly, although charophyte algae do not respond to ABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, the Klebsormidium genome shares with the land plants all the core genes of ABA signalling with the exception of ABA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and our observation that the <italic>Klebsormidium</italic> SnRK2 ortholog can complement the <italic>P. patens</italic> QKO mutant in transducing an ABA signal supports the view that the recruitment of ABA to regulate a pre-existing ARK-SnRK2-dependent dehydration response was a major adaptation enabling the successful colonisation of terrestrial environments. It is evident from the transient assay that orthologs of ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) in <italic>P. patens</italic> function in ABA signalling upstream of SnRK2 since their introduction into wild-type cells enhanced the ABA response of the <italic>PpLEA1</italic> promoter but no effect was observed when introduced into QKO (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">15</xref>). Although the activation of Arabidopsis SnRK2 is regulated through ABA-dependent interaction between ABA receptors and PP2CA, <italic>P. patens</italic> PP2CA seems to act downstream of SnRK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Recent phosphoproteomic analysis of <italic>P. patens</italic> demonstrated that SnRK2 was phosphorylated in an ABA-dependent manner in the absence of PP2CA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, indicating the existence of an additional ABA-signal transduction pathway independent of the PYL/PP2CA interaction. These observations suggest an ancestral form of ABA signalling, in which ABA-dependent activation of SnRK2 is mediated through ARK. ARK belongs to the B3 mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, which can be divided into three subgroups (ARK-like, CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1-like, and ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE-like), but ARK-like B3- MAPKKK was lost during land plant evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, probably by acquiring a new mechanism to regulate subclass III SnRK2 by PP2CA through the PYL-ABA interaction. Emergence of a novel subclass I SnRK2 signalling module after the separation of bryophytes and vascular plants might have enabled vascular plants to develop new systems to cope with osmostress conditions independent of ABA/PP2CA regulation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant materials and growth condition</title><p id="Par16">The Gransden wild-type strain of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> ssp. patens was used as the wild-type strain.
