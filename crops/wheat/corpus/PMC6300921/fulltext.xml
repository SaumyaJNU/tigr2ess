Root exudates are technically challenging to measure in soil because roots are difficult to access and exudates can be bound by minerals or consumed by microorganisms. Exudates are easier to measure with hydroponically-grown plants but, even here, simple compounds such as sugars and organic acids can be rapidly assimilated by microorganisms. Sterile hydroponic systems avoid this shortcoming but it is very difficult to maintain sterility for long periods especially for larger crop species. As a consequence, studies often use small model species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to measure exudates or use seedlings of crop plants which only have immature roots systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We developed a simple hydroponic system for cultivating large crop plants in sterile conditions for more than 30&#x000a0;days. Using this system wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) plants were grown in sterile conditions for 30&#x000a0;days by which time they had reached the six-leaf stage and developed mature root systems with seminal, nodal and lateral roots. To demonstrate the utility of this system we characterized the aluminium-activated exudation of malate from the major types of wheat roots for the first time. We found that all root types measured&#x000a0;released malate but the amounts were two-fold greater from the seminal and nodal axile roots compared with the lateral roots. Additionally, we showed that this sterile growth system could be used to collect exudates from intact whole root systems of barley.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">We developed a simple hydroponic system that enables cereal plants to be grown in sterile conditions for longer periods than previously recorded. Using this system we measured, for the first time, the aluminium-activated efflux of malate from the major types of wheat roots. We showed the system can also be used for collecting exudates from intact root systems of 30-day-old barley plants. This hydroponic system can be modified for various purposes. Importantly it enables the study of exudates from crop species with mature root systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13007-018-0380-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hydroponic</kwd><kwd>Root exudates</kwd><kwd>Organic anion</kwd><kwd>Malate</kwd><kwd>Aluminium-tolerance</kwd><kwd>Wheat</kwd><kwd>Barley</kwd><kwd>Sterile system</kwd><kwd><italic>TaALMT1</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CSIRO OCE Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></funding-source><award-id>1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawasaki</surname><given-names>Akitomo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Cereal plants are estimated to release approximately 11% of their net fixed carbon from the roots as rhizodeposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These deposits include sloughed off border cells and tissues, mucilage, volatile organic molecules and exudates comprised of high and low molecular weight compounds such as sugars, amino acids, phenolics, and organic anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Collectively these compounds modify the rhizosphere and affect the composition and abundance of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Plants are also known to release specific exudate compounds in response to certain environmental stresses. A well-studied example is the release of organic anions from root apices in response to the toxic aluminium (Al<sup>3+</sup>) ions prevalent in acid soils. These anions protect the sensitive root apices by chelating the toxic Al<sup>3+</sup> cations in the apoplast of root cells to form less-harmful complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In wheat this response is controlled by two genes: <italic>TaALMT1</italic> on chromosome 4DL and <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> on chromosome 4BL. <italic>TaALMT1</italic> encodes an anion channel from the aluminium-activated malate transporter family that releases malate anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] while <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> encodes a transporter from the multidrug and toxic compound exudation (MATE) family that releases citrate anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both TaALMT1 and TaMATE1B are constitutively expressed in the root apices of wheat. However, TaALMT1 requires soluble Al<sup>3+</sup> cations to activate malate release at low pH, whereas citrate release via TaALMT1B is constitutive and independent of external pH or Al<sup>3+</sup> concentration.</p><p id="Par5">Various methods have been used to collect root exudates and they all have advantages and disadvantages. Exudates can be collected directly from the soil adjacent to roots using suction cups with polymer or ceramic filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] but it is unclear how the samples collected this way have been modified by microorganisms and, therefore, how well they reflect the compounds released from the roots. Hydroponic systems are convenient for measuring root exudates because they avoid the mechanical damage incurred by removing roots from solid substrates and minimise the microbial degradation of exudates that will occur in soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Non-sterile hydroponic systems have been successfully employed to measure certain root exudates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but this becomes more difficult in mature plants because contamination is inevitable. Therefore, the composition and quantity of exudates collected in non-sterile hydroponics growth systems will be affected by microbial activity as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Sterile hydroponic systems enable root exudates to be measured under controlled conditions. These systems are generally suitable for seedlings or small plants like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that can be grown easily in low-volume wells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or sterile glass flasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is technically difficult to maintain sterility much beyond the seedling stage with larger plants including many crop species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The reason for this is that the whole plant needs to be fully enclosed to prevent contamination and the roots require larger volumes of hydroponic solution to match their nutrient needs. The solutions need to be renewed periodically and constantly aerated to avoid anaerobic conditions. Both of these requirements increase the risk of contamination. Consequently, most previous studies that have examined the exudates from crop species (e.g. wheat, barley and maize) in sterile conditions have used young plants with immature root systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The well-characterised organic anion release from Al-resistant wheat plants has only been performed on the seminal roots of young seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and it is unknown whether the same response occurs in the nodal or lateral roots of older plants. This is an important omission since the composition and quantity of exudates can change with plant age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and seminal roots represent a small fraction of the total root system of a mature plant.</p><p id="Par7">A few studies claim to have maintained sterile root systems on wheat and maize plants for several weeks. For instance, Gaume et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] studied root exudates from 18- and 21-day-old maize plants, and Warren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] examined root exudates from 28-day-old wheat plants. However, it is very unlikely that either of these studies maintained truly sterile root systems over those periods because the shoots were not fully enclosed in sterile chambers. There is a need to develop new methods for analysing exudates from the various root types on mature crop plants under sterile conditions.</p><p id="Par8">We describe a simple and novel hydroponic system that is fully-enclosed and able to maintain crop plants like wheat and barley in sterile conditions until at least the six-leaf stage. Nodal roots and an extensive lateral root system were able to develop during this time. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we characterised the Al<sup>3+</sup>-activated malate exudation from the seminal, nodal and lateral roots for the first time. We show that this system is also suitable for collecting exudates from the whole intact root systems from similarly-aged sterile plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A system for growing large crop plants under sterile conditions for 30&#x000a0;days</title><p id="Par9">A hydroponic system was developed for growing cereals such as wheat and barley under axenic conditions for at least 30&#x000a0;days, which was sufficient for plants to develop mature root systems comprising seminal, nodal and lateral roots.</p><p id="Par10"><italic>Surface sterilising the seed</italic> An important obstacle in maintaining sterility was ensuring the seed was effectively surface-sterilized prior to germination. Using wheat grain from different batches or sources several methods were tested which&#x000a0;included various combinations of ethanol, bleach and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> washes, fumigation with chlorine gas and heat treatments. Sterility was easier to achieve if the grain were freshly harvested, clean and visibly free from fungal contamination. Bacteria were relatively easy to control and a single treatment with bleach or chlorine gas was sufficient to eliminate bacterial growth. The fungal spores were more resilient and could not always be controlled with a single treatment with bleach or chlorine gas. Fungal contamination was sometimes detected many days after germination. Endophytes were difficult to eliminate because they were embedded in tissues, but as long as they did not emerge from the rhizodermis and infect the solution they did not affect exudate composition. The most effective procedure for preventing fungal contamination started by imbibing the seed and then using a series of bleach and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> washes followed by a 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C heat treatment (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section). This procedure reduced germination rates by 5&#x02013;28%, depending on the seed batch, however the sterilized seedlings developed 130&#x02013;213% longer seminal roots (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) than the non-sterilized seeds after 14&#x000a0;days on agar/nutrient plates and the plants later grew well. The method was similarly effective in sterilising barley seed and may be equally useful for sterilising non-cereal species.</p><p id="Par11">Sterile-growth system: The system is fully enclosed and comprised of two joined chambers made from polypropylene containers or jars. The 2&#x000a0;L upper chamber covered the plant shoot and the 3&#x000a0;L lower chamber contained the roots and nutrient solution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Detailed descriptions of the materials required and the procedure for constructing the apparatus is described in the Methods section. These chambers enabled the nutrient solutions to be aerated constantly and renewed regularly without microbial contamination. The polypropylene containers used to construct the system were slightly opaque and reduced the light intensity by&#x02009;~&#x02009;18%. The light intensity of the growth cabinet was 610&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photon m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> but the intensity inside the upper chamber was&#x02009;~&#x02009;500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photon m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However polypropylene containers were most suitable because, apart from being readily available and inexpensive, they withstand autoclaving, are easy to process (drill and glue) and release minimum amounts of organic substances.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>A photograph and a schematic drawing of the hydroponic system. The system is mainly comprised of an upper chamber that contains aerial part of the plant and a lower chamber that contains the nutrient solution and the plant root system. The plant is held between the two compartments with a plant holder insert.

The nutrient solutions were changed regularly and sterility was confirmed by periodically plating out a sample of nutrient solution on agar/nutrient plates. No bacterial contamination was detected in any of the samples but fungal contamination developed in two of the 30 systems assembled. The most likely source of this contamination was the seed. The composition of the nutrient solution is at the discretion of the experimenter. We used a simple low-strength nutrient solution (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d; section) and nutritional status of the plants and pH of the nutrient solution were monitored. During the preliminary experiments solutions were renewed weekly and while no visual deficiency or toxicity symptoms were detected, tissue analysis at harvest indicated marginal P deficiency in some plants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The solutions were changed more frequently in subsequent experiments. These changes also helped to maintain the solution pH which tended to decrease between solution changes (from pH 6.0 to 5.0). Changes in pH can also be minimised by adding a buffering agent or by modifying the composition of the nutrient solution (especially the ratio of ammonium and nitrate) depending on the experimental goals and the species being tested. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Elemental analysis of hydroponically-grown wheat shoot tissue</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Element</th><th align="left">Hydroponics</th><th align="left">Reference value<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Al (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">2.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;&#x02009;200</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">4.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1</td><td align="left">3&#x02013;25</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ca (% w w<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.20&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td align="left">0.18&#x02013;0.40</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cu (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">17.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5</td><td align="left">1.3&#x02013;18.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fe (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2</td><td align="left">25&#x02013;100</td></tr><tr><td align="left">K (% w w<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">3.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1</td><td align="left">3.0&#x02013;3.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mg (% w w<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.003</td><td align="left">0.05&#x02013;0.40</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mn (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6</td><td align="left">&#x0003c;&#x02009;700</td></tr><tr><td align="left">P (% w w<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02</td><td align="left">0.24&#x02013;0.70</td></tr><tr><td align="left">S (% w w<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">0.35&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01</td><td align="left">0.28&#x02013;0.30</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Zn (mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td char="&#x000b1;" align="char">102&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4</td><td align="left">18&#x02013;390</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Whole-shoot tissues of sterile hydroponically grown 30-day-old wheat plants were homogenised and elemental content analysed by ICP-MS.

Barley (cv Golden Promise) plants grown in&#x000a0;the hydroponic system for 30&#x000a0;days was slightly more vigorous than wheat and showed a greater variation in final root and shoot biomass (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Roots were rinsed twice with sterile MilliQ water to wash off cell debris and nutrient solution, and root exudates were collected from the whole, intact root system in sterile MilliQ water for 2&#x000a0;h. Exudate compounds were identified with untargeted GC&#x02013;MS analysis. The original nutrient solution cannot be analysed directly because the mineral salts are incompatible with GC&#x02013;MS analysis. Furthermore, over time some exudates are likely to be reabsorbed by the roots. While not quantified in detail a total of 95 metabolites were detected among the barley root exudates with the major metabolite groups being amino acids (24 metabolites), organic acids (11 metabolites) or sugars and sugar derivatives (20 metabolites) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The experiment demonstrates another method for collecting exudates from sterile intact roots on more mature plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par18">Root exudates are an important means by which plants interact with and control their environment. Hydroponic systems are widely used for studying root exudates even though they lack many of the chemical and mechanical stimuli that could affect growth and exudation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Notwithstanding the artificial nature of hydroponic systems, the literature contains many reports where the physiological processes described in hydroponically grown plants, and even sterile conditions, reflect the same processes occurring in soil-grown plants. Examples include the root exudates associated with aluminium resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], nutrient stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and signalling. For instance, a diverse range of flavonoids released from roots in hydroponics are known to affect signalling, nodulation, plant development, pathogen defence and bacterial quorum sensing in the soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and their roles as inducers of nodulation genes in rhizobia has been demonstrated in vitro using flavonoids collected from the exudates of hydroponically grown plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Other links have been established between the exudates collected in hydroponics and the microbiome developed around soil-grown&#x000a0;plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Root exudates can be technically difficult to measure and most methods use seedlings or small plants (e.g. Arabidopsis) grown in hydroponic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Larger plants pose more challenges especially if sterile conditions are required to avoid microbial degradation of the exudates. Warren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] collected exudates from 4-week old wheat plants but since the shoots were not fully-enclosed it is unlikely that sterility of the roots was maintained. While the nutrient solutions were changed frequently in those experiments (every 2 to 6&#x000a0;days) the roots were maintained in a 250&#x000a0;mL container which is small considering the root biomass on wheat plants of that age.</p><p id="Par20">The fully-enclosed hydroponic growth system described in this study could maintain sterility until wheat and barley plants were at least 30&#x000a0;days old by which time they had developed mature root systems. Five features of this method are emphasised: (1) Surface-sterilization of the seed is critical to avoid contamination; (2) The system maintained sterility in the chambers despite constant aeration and regular changes in nutrient solutions; (3) The large lower chamber allowed a relatively large volume (2.2&#x000a0;L) of nutrient solution to be included for root growth. This reduced the number of solution changes required which is important for minimising the risk of contamination; (4) The materials are inexpensive and the assembly is straight forward and uncomplicated; (5) The volume of the chambers can, in principle, be scaled up so that the plants can be grown for longer periods than described in this study.</p><p id="Par21">Composition of the nutrient solution and pH can be adjusted to match the species or experiment requirements. It is important to maintain the pH stable because it influences the bioavailability of some nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A pH range of 5.5&#x02013;6.5 is considered optimum for growing wheat in hydroponics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We used 1&#x000a0;mM MES to buffer the nutrient solution to pH 6.0 but other buffers with different pKa values are available and the concentration of these can be increased to stabilise pH as long as growth is not adversely affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">This growth system enabled us to characterise the Al<sup>3+</sup>-activated malate efflux from specific root types of mature wheat plants. This response is the major mechanism of Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and although it has been studied in detail for 25&#x000a0;years, all previous reports have used young seedlings with seminal roots only. This has been an important omission because wheat seedlings only develop three to six seminal axile roots which represents a very small proportion of the final root length on mature plants. Nodal roots are probably 10 to 20-fold more numerous than seminal roots, while lateral roots represent approximately 95% of total root length in mature cereal plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Clearly these other roots types play a critical role in accessing water and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This sterile growth system enabled us to measure the malate efflux from the four major types of root (seminal axile, nodal axile, seminal lateral and nodal lateral) on 30-day-old wheat plants for the first time. We found that the Al<sup>3+</sup>-dependent malate release from seminal and nodal roots averaged 2.5&#x000a0;nmol root apex<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which was greater than previous reports from seminal roots of 5-day-old seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lateral roots released less malate than the seminal and nodal axile roots, even after normalising for differences in root surface area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results demonstrate that the malate exudation from seminal roots is maintained for many weeks and that similar responses occur on the nodal and lateral roots. This study only investigated malate exudation but the system could be used to measure other exudates from various root types and in different genotypes.</p><p id="Par23"><italic>TaALMT1</italic> is constitutively expressed in all four root types which is consistent with rapid activation of malate by Al<sup>3+</sup> treatment from all the roots. Interestingly, expression level in lateral roots was significantly greater than the seminal or nodal axile roots even though malate efflux was less from the laterals. Future studies should compare TaALMT1 protein levels since protein/mRNA ratios for a given gene can be vary between tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The newly developed hydroponic system was also suitable for collecting exudates from whole-root systems. We demonstrated this by analysing the exudates from the whole root system of sterile 30-day-old barley plants. We collected root exudates by submerging the roots in 200&#x000a0;mL of MilliQ water in a 600&#x000a0;mL beaker with gentle shaking. This volume can be adjusted depending on the root biomass to minimize stress and damage to the tissue. Prolonged treatment to MilliQ water will damage roots because the integrity the root cell membranes can be compromised when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absent from the solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However the inclusion of too many salts in the solution poses other problems because&#x000a0;once they become concentrated after lyophilisation they can interfere with the GC&#x02013;MS analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. As a compromise, we collected the exudates in MilliQ water but only for 2&#x000a0;h. This is shorter than many other studies, some of which collected exudates in ultra-pure water for up to 3&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Furthermore, the metabolite profile of root exudates collected in water or 0.5&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was quantitatively and qualitatively similar after short collections periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Non-targeted GC&#x02013;MS analysis identified a wide range of compounds with amino acids representing the largest metabolite group. This profile is generally consistent with other root exudate studies of barley and wheat grown in sterile sand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], moistened filter paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and in hydroponics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Even though exudates were collected over a relatively short period it is possible that the quantity of some compounds might be underestimated using this technique if the roots reabsorb them after being released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

A hole (6&#x000a0;cm diameter) was bored in the centre of the screw cap of the polypropylene tube (Part #3). This allowed a disc of plastic mesh (Part #5) to sit on the inside when the tube was suspended from the glued lids.

These later held filters to vent air from the upper chamber. Firstly, syringe needles were obtained and the metal needles removed from their plastic bases by sawing or cutting. These bases (Part #9) were inserted into the drilled holes and glued in place so that 0.45&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m nylon syringe filters (Part #11) could be later inserted on the outside (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Two 4&#x000a0;mm holes were drilled on the side of the lower chamber (Part #2). The first hole was drilled 4&#x000a0;cm from the top for the air inflow to aerate the solution. The second hole was drilled near the bottom of the chamber and was used for draining when the nutrient solution required changing (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An inline plastic tap (Part #6) was screwed into the upper air inlet hole and glued in place. Once dry an elbow adaptor (Part #8) was firmly attached and glued to the tap on the inner side of the chamber. On the outer side of the chamber, a syringe head (Part #10) was attached and glued to the inline tap (Part #6), and this allowed a syringe filter (Part #12) to be attached for filtering the incoming air. A 20&#x000a0;cm length of silicon tubing (Part #13) was attached to the elbow adapter (Part #8) so that the lower end of the tubing was near the bottom of the chamber. A 4&#x000a0;mm threaded adaptor (Part #7) was screwed into the bottom draining hole and glued in place. A&#x02009;~&#x02009;10&#x000a0;cm length of silicon tubing (Part #13) was attached to the draining adaptor (Part #7) at the bottom of the jar. This draining tube was plugged with a plastic plug, which can be made from a 1&#x000a0;mL syringe head that&#x000a0;had the hole was sealed&#x000a0;with heat (Part #10), and clamped with a metal bulldog clip (Part #14).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">The whole system can be pre-assembled, filled with nutrient solution, and then autoclaved, or each component can be wrapped in foils, autoclaved separately and then assembled in the laminar flow hood.</p></list-item></list>

A 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m sterile nylon syringe filter (Part #12) was attached to the air inlet tap (Part #6 and 10 joint) to filter the inward-flowing air (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A series of 0.45&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m sterile nylon syringe filters (Part #11) were then inserted into the adaptors (Part #9) at the top of the upper chamber (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S7).</p><p id="Par37">Sterile nutrient solution (~&#x02009;2.2&#x000a0;L) was added to the lower chamber until the solution just touched the bottom of the plant holder when it was inserted and suspended from the hole in the glued lids (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S6). The lower chamber was screwed into the glued lids, and using sterile forceps, a surface-sterilized, germinated seedling was carefully placed on the middle of the plastic mesh of the plant holder so that its young roots passed through the mesh and into the nutrient solution. The upper compartment was then screwed into the other side of the glued lids. The compartments and the glued lids were sealed with Parafilm.</p><p id="Par38">Plants were cultivated in a growth cabinet (Conviron, Canada) with a 16&#x000a0;h&#x000a0;day/8&#x000a0;h night cycle (20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C/15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and 610&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photon m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> light intensity. The light intensity was attenuated in the polypropylene containers by&#x02009;~&#x02009;18%. The lower chamber was not covered so that root development could be easily monitored. However, if it is important that the nutrient solution not be exposed to light the lower chamber can easily be covered with foil or cloth. Typically 12 hydroponic setups were prepared at one time. Aquarium pump tubing (Part #16) of equal length were attached from the 0.22&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m filters to a manifold which was connected to an air compressor (Part #15). The tube connecting the manifold to the air compressor first passed air through a closed chamber containing activated carbon granules which removed organic volatiles emitted from the pump. The equal length of tubing between the manifold and each inlet port helped ensure the air pressure going to each apparatus was equal. Final aeration rates were 2.9 L air min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p id="Par39">Nutrient solutions required changing once or twice a week depending on the size of the plants but this will vary depending on the species and the composition of the nutrient media. To change the solutions the aeration tubes were detached from the filters and each apparatus transferred to a laminar flow hood. The solutions were drained into a container via the bottom tube by removing the bulldog clip and the plug (this occurred more easily if the lower chamber is unscrewed slightly). The plug was sterilized with 70% EtOH each time it was removed from the tube. Once the solution was drained, the draining tube was plugged and clipped again and the lower chamber unscrewed from the lid. Fresh sterile nutrient solution was added to the lower chamber, by lifting the upper chamber (with the plant holder and plant) for a short time. At each change the pH of the used solution was measured and sterility checked by plating out a sample on Nutrient Broth agar plates and incubating them at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Plant sampling and root exudate collection</title><p id="Par40">Wheat and barley plants were harvested after another 28&#x000a0;days of cultivation in the hydroponic system (30&#x000a0;days old from germination). To measure malate exudation from various wheat roots, the upper and the lower chambers were detached, and plants carefully removed from the plant holder and laid on a tray with sterile nutrient solution. The mesh disc remained attached to the roots. The plant was scored for growth stage, tiller number and nodal root number. All axile roots (nodal and seminal) were cut off from the base of the stem and washed in sterile 0.2&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. The root apices (5&#x000a0;mm) of seminal axile roots, nodal axile roots and the primary lateral roots of seminal and nodal roots were excised with a scalpel and placed in a glass tube. Malate released from these root apices was collected as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Each replicate included five root apices from seminal axile roots, 10-15 root apices from nodal axile roots, and 30 root apices from each lateral root type. They were washed with 1&#x000a0;mL of 0.2&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 4.3) in 5&#x000a0;mL glass vials sealed with Parafilm by placing the vials on their sides on a platform shaker (~&#x02009;50&#x000a0;rpm) for 30&#x000a0;min. The washing solution was removed, and the root apices were rinsed twice with 1&#x000a0;mL of 0.2&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 4.3) (control treatment) or with 0.2&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> with 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AlCl<sub>3</sub> (pH 4.3) (+Al<sup>3+</sup> treatment).

The root exudate solutions were removed and stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until the subsequent organic anion analysis. The remaining root apex tissues were stored at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for later RNA extraction. The diameter of each root type was later measured from stereo microscope images.</p><p id="Par41">To collect exudates from the whole root system of sterile 30-day-old barley plants, the lower chamber of the apparatus was detached and the root system rinsed twice in sterile MilliQ water to wash off the cell debris and nutrient solution.
