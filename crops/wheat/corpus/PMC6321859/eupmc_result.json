    "This data article is a presentation of data related to the research article entitled \"Crop rotation and residue management effects under no-till on the soil quality of a Haplic Cambisol in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa\" (Gura and Mnkeni, 2019) [1]. A number of soil experimental techniques were used to acquire the soil indicators data and the data was interpreted using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to assess and quantify the impacts of conservation agriculture strategies on soil quality. The data was processed and analyzed using the JMP statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., 2013) [2]. The data is made available for further use and for furthering the understanding of the key findings of the related research."
