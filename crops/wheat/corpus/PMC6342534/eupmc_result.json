    "We have previously shown that supplementation of wheat with hot-water extract reduces myocardial injury by inhibiting apoptosis in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). Arabinogalactan-peptide (AGP), a cell wall polysaccharide of wheat, was also responsible for the protection. However, the underlying mechanisms were not elucidated. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms for how AGP supplementation reduces myocardial injury. First, we isolated highly pure AGP from all-purpose wheat flour. We supplemented rats with AGP at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d for 3 days, and subjected the rats to ischemia (30 min) through ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by reperfusion (3 h) through a release of the ligation. Supplementation with AGP significantly reduced the infarct size in the heart. In addition, AGP intake inhibited the apoptotic cascade, determined through decreased mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylation, decreased Bcl-2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma ratios, and decreased generation of nicked DNA, which was confirmed through western blotting and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining. These findings indicate that AGP intake can protect against myocardial injury. Traditionally, consumption of dietary fiber such as AGP has been shown to reduce MI risk by inhibiting preocclusion steps through reducing risk factors. Our findings suggest that AGP intake can also reduce MI risk by inhibiting postocclusion steps. This study describes a better dietary recommendation and new prevention strategy for reducing MI risk through regular consumption of wheat rich in AGP."
