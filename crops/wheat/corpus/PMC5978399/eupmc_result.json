    "Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) is one of the major viruses causing a widespread and serious viral disease affecting cereal crops. To gain a better understanding of plant defence mechanisms of BYDV resistance genes (Bdv2 and RYd2) against BYDV-PAV infection, the differences in agronomical, biochemical and histological changes between susceptible and resistant wheat and barley cultivars were investigated. We found that root growth and total dry matter of susceptible cultivars showed greater reduction than that of resistant ones after infection. BYDV infected leaves in susceptible wheat and barley cultivars showed a significant reduction in photosynthetic pigments, an increase in the concentration of reducing sugar. The protein levels were also low in infected leaves. There was a significant increase in total phenol contents in resistant cultivars, which might reflect a protective mechanism of plants against virus infection. In phloem tissue, sieve elements (SE) and companion cells (CC) were severely damaged in susceptible cultivars after infection. It is suggested that restriction of viral movement in the phloem tissue and increased production of phenolic compounds may play a role in the resistance and defensive mechanisms of both Bdv2 and RYd2 against virus infection."
