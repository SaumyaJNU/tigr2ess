    "BACKGROUND:Salinity is a major abiotic stressor that affects seed germination, plant growth, and crop production. Seed germination represents the beginning of plant growth and is closely linked with subsequent crop development and ultimate yield formation. This study attempted to extend findings regarding the potential proteomic dynamics during wheat seed germination under salt stress and to explore the mechanism of crop salt response. RESULTS:Salt stress significantly affected seed physiological activities during the germination process, resulting in significant decreases in phytohormone and Î±-amylase activity and significant increases in soluble sugar, starch, and ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase activity. A comparative proteomics approach was applied to analyze the dynamic proteome changes of embryo and endosperm during seed germination in Chinese winter wheat cultivar Zhengmai 366 under salt stress. Two-dimensional electrophoresis identified 92 and 61 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) in response to salt stress in embryo and endosperm, respectively. Both organs contained a high proportion of DAPs involved in stress defense, energy metabolism, and protein/amino acid metabolism. The endosperm had more DAPs related to storage proteins and starch metabolism than the embryo, and 2% of DAPs participating in lipid and sterol metabolism were specifically detected in the embryo. CONCLUSIONS:Seed physiological activities were significantly affected during the germination process when subjected to salt stress. The DAPs involved in stress defense and energy metabolism were upregulated whereas those related to reserve substance degradation and protein/amino acid metabolism were significantly downregulated, leading to delayed seed germination under salt stress. Our proteomic results revealed synergistic regulation of the response to salt stress during seed germination."
