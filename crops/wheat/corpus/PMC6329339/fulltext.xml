Defensins represent the most important AMP family involved in defense and non-defense functions. In this work, global RNA sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly were performed to explore the diversity of defensin-like (DEFL) genes in the wheat <italic>Triticum kiharae</italic> and to study their role in induced resistance (IR) mediated by the elicitor metabolites of a non-pathogenic strain FS-94 of <italic>Fusarium sambucinum</italic>. Using a combination of two pipelines for DEFL mining in transcriptome data sets, as many as 143 DEFL genes were identified in <italic>T. kiharae,</italic> the vast majority of them represent novel genes. According to the number of cysteine residues and the cysteine motif, wheat DEFLs were classified into ten groups. Classical defensins with a characteristic 8-Cys motif assigned to group 1 DEFLs represent the most abundant group comprising 52 family members. DEFLs with a characteristic 4-Cys motif CX{3,5}CX{8,17}CX{4,6}C named group 4 DEFLs previously found only in legumes were discovered in wheat. Within DEFL groups, subgroups of similar sequences originated by duplication events were isolated. Variation among DEFLs within subgroups is due to amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions of amino acid sequences. To identify IR-related DEFL genes, transcriptional changes in DEFL gene expression during elicitor-mediated IR were monitored. Transcriptional diversity of DEFL genes in wheat seedlings in response to the fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, FS-94 elicitors, and the combination of both (elicitors + fungus) was demonstrated, with specific sets of up- and down-regulated DEFL genes. DEFL expression profiling allowed us to gain insight into the mode of action of the elicitors from <italic>F. sambucinum.</italic> We discovered that the elicitors up-regulated a set of 24 DEFL genes. After challenge inoculation with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, another set of 22 DEFLs showed enhanced expression in IR-displaying seedlings. These DEFLs, in concert with other defense molecules, are suggested to determine enhanced resistance of elicitor-pretreated wheat seedlings. In addition to providing a better understanding of the mode of action of the elicitors from FS-94 in controlling diseases, up-regulated IR-specific DEFL genes represent novel candidates for genetic transformation of plants and development of pathogen-resistant&#x000a0;crops.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Antimicrobial peptides</kwd><kwd>Defensins</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Induced resistance</kwd><kwd>Next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>Triticum kiharae</kwd><kwd><italic>Fusarium</italic> spp.</kwd><kwd>Elicitor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Russian Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>16-16-00032</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant no 16-16-00032) for Tatyana I.

Although plants are devoid of highly specific adaptive immune response characteristic of higher vertebrates, they share with animals the so-called innate immunity. It is based on both constitutive and inducible mechanisms preventing pathogen ingress and growth in host tissues. The crucial step in activation of defense responses in plants is perception of pathogens by two types of receptors &#x02013; PRR (pattern recognition receptors) and the products of the resistance (R) genes (<xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Jones &#x00026; Dangl, 2006</xref>). Recognition of pathogens by both types of receptors activates signaling cascades that trigger defense gene expression. Defense reactions induced in plants include both physical and chemical protection, such as the reinforcement of cell walls through lignification and deposition of callose and synthesis of antimicrobial substances, such as phytoalexins and antimicrobial proteins and peptides (AMPs).</p><p>AMPs are small (&#x0003c;10 kDa) effector molecules of the plant immune system which provide a rapid and cost-effective &#x0201c;chemical&#x0201d; defense to circumvent infection (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Broekaert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Odintsova &#x00026; Egorov, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Tam et al., 2015</xref>). Structurally diverse, they directly target a wide range of pathogens utilizing different modes of action and providing the first line of defense against invading microbes. Several families of plant AMPs have been discriminated. Defensins belong to the most ancient AMP family being discovered in fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Lay &#x00026; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho &#x00026; Gomes, 2009</xref>). Plant defensins are small (40&#x02013;50 amino acid residues), cysteine-rich, and cationic peptides. They display low sequence similarity except for conserved cysteine residues. The global fold of defensins comprises one &#x003b1;-helix and a triple-stranded antiparallel &#x003b2;-sheet stabilized by disulfide bonds. The plant defensins belong to the so-called cis-defensins characterized by two parallel disulphide bonds connecting the third &#x003b2;-strand to the &#x003b1;-helix (<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Shafee et al., 2016</xref>). Defensins are synthesized as precursor proteins. According to the precursor structure, two main classes of defensins have been discriminated (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Lay &#x00026; Anderson, 2005</xref>). The precursors of class 1 defensins consist of a signal peptide and a mature defensin domain. The precursors of class 2 defensins possess an additional C-terminal prodomain required for vacuolar targeting and detoxification of the peptide during its movement through the plant secretory pathway (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Lay et al., 2014</xref>). Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of isolated peptides, gene expression analysis and studies of transgenic plants, defensins were postulated to be involved in defense against fungal and bacterial pathogens and insect pests (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Lay &#x00026; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho &#x00026; Gomes, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Vriens, Cammue &#x00026; Thevissen, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Cools et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Parisi et al., 2018</xref>), abiotic stress tolerance to salinity, drought, cold and metals (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Lay &#x00026; Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Mirouze et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Parisi et al., 2018</xref>), and in other, non-defense functions (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Stotz, Spence &#x00026; Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Shafee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Parisi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Studies of innate immunity in plants showed that in addition to local responses, local infection increases resistance of the entire plant to a wide spectrum of pathogens, the phenomenon called systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (<xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 1961</xref>; <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Ryals et al., 1996</xref>). Beneficial microbes, such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), mycorrhizal fungi (PGPF) and non-pathogenic strains of pathogenic fungi and their metabolites produce general or specific elicitors which are able to induce the same systemic resistance of the whole plant (ISR, induced systemic resistance) (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Heil &#x00026; Bostock, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Gozzo, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Choudhary, Prakash &#x00026; Johri, 2007</xref>). The onset of SAR is accompanied by a local and systemic increase in the levels of salicylic acid (SA) (<xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;traux et al., 1990</xref>) and up-regulation of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Maleck et al., 2000</xref>). Some of them display antimicrobial activity and are supposed to contribute to enhanced resistance. ISR depends on the plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) and is not associated with PR-protein accumulation (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Hoffland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse et al., 1996</xref>). However, some PGRP and PGPF induce SA-dependent or both SA- and JA/ET- dependent systemic resistance (<xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Sultana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Molitor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Gkizi et al., 2016</xref>). Despite considerable advances in understanding of the molecular mechanisms of interactions between plants and pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms in induced resistance, the details of the processes involved, especially the role of antimicrobial peptides, remain largely unknown. Studies of induced resistance are of prime importance for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of plant immunity. In addition, they have significant practical applications for the development of novel disease control measures based on activation of plant&#x02019;s own defense mechanisms by microbial biocontrol agents. Although the economic potential of biocontrol strains in increasing disease resistance in crops is enormous, the molecular components and mechanisms of resistance induced by biocontrol strains and their metabolites remain largely enigmatic that hampers their practical application.</p><p>Earlier, we showed that the intracellular elicitor metabolites produced by the biocontrol <italic>Fusarium sambucinum</italic> (isolate FS-94) protect wheat from <italic>Stagonospora nodorum</italic> causing glume/leaf blotch as well as from multiple fungi belonging to the pathogenic root rot complex (<italic>F.&#x000a0;culmorum</italic>, <italic>F.&#x000a0;avenaceum</italic>, <italic>F.&#x000a0;oxysporum</italic>, <italic>F.&#x000a0;sporotrichioides</italic>, <italic>F.&#x000a0;gibbosum</italic>, and <italic>Bipolaris sorokiniana</italic>) (<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et al., 2018</xref>) and induce systemic resistance in plants (<xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et al., 2018</xref>). In this work, to further analyze the mode of action of the resistance elicitors from <italic>F.&#x000a0;sambucinum</italic> and to elucidate the role of defensins, one of the most important AMP family, in induced resistance (IR), we used global transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of wheat seedlings treated with the elicitors and displaying IR.

The ready models of DEFL precursors were obtained from SPADA (<xref rid="ref-74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These models describe sequences that belong to one of four groups of motifs presented in <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The models were created for amino acid sequences of defensins and defensin-like peptides detected in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> by <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (2007)</xref>. The pipeline works in several steps. First, the hidden Markov models are aligned against the transcriptome with hmmsearch from HMMER package (<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Durbin et al., 1998</xref>). Amino acid sequences in FASTA-like formats are required as input. Next, the detected sequences are filtered by the Perl scripts. The first script filters the hits by <italic>E</italic>-value (<italic>E</italic>-value &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). The second script detects signal peptides in the remaining sequences of defensin/DEFL precursors. It uses console version of SignalP v4.1 for this purpose (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Bendtsen et al., 2004</xref>). Sequences without signal peptides are discarded. After that, the third script checks the discovered sequences to match the structure MZ..Z{C}m{X}n{C}l{X}k..*, where MZ..Z is a signal peptide; M, methionine; Z, any amino acid; C, cysteine; X, any amino acid residue except cysteine; m,n,l, <italic>k</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1,2,3&#x02026;; *is a stop codon. Thus, the resulting precursor of a defensin-like peptide consists of a signal peptide that starts with methionine and a cysteine motif. After all quality control processes, the nucleotide sequences of peptides are detected by a specific script written in Perl. It uses the coordinates of the discovered precursors in amino acid sequences of transcriptome contigs and counts the corresponding coordinates in nucleotide sequences of the original nucleotide sequence of the translated contig. As a result, a collection of predicted amino acid and nucleotide sequences of identified defensin-like precursors is obtained.</p><table-wrap id="table-1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.6125/table-1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>A list of defensin cysteine motifs used for DEFL mining in wheat transcriptomes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="peerj-07-6125-g009"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Motif</bold></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Approximate length (aa)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-X{4,25}-C-X{2,12}-C-X{3,4}-C-X{3,17}-C-X{4,32}-C-X-C-X{1,6}-C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40&#x02013;70</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-X{3,21}-C-X{2,12}-C-X{3,4}-C-X{3,15}-C-X{4,23}-C-C-C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40&#x02013;60</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-X{2,14}-C-X{3,5}-C-X{3,16}-C-X{4,28}-C-X-C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25&#x02013;50</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C-X{3,5}-C-X{8,17}-C-X{4,6}-C</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20&#x02013;30</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-1fn"><p><bold>Notes.</bold></p></fn><fn id="table-1fn1" fn-type="other"><p>Amino acids are designated as follows: C, cysteine, X, any amino acid residue except cysteine.

This pipeline consists of scripts that scan transcriptome for sequences that match certain regular expressions. The general structure of regular expressions was as shown above. They include known structures of cysteine motifs found in defensin-like peptides (<xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The structure of regular expressions also considers the methionine residue at the beginning of the sequence. After obtaining a set of sequences that satisfy the structure of constructed regular expressions, the identified sequences are filtered by the presence of a signal peptide. At this step, the script from the first pipeline with the corresponding function is used.

Group 1 is the most abundant DEFL group with 52 members named from DEFL1-1 to DEFL1-52 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). Group 1 DEFLs consist of a signal peptide and a mature peptide domain, therefore, encode class 1 defensins. Three DEFLs (DEFLs 1-13, 1-30 and 1-42) have short C-terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). The length of the signal peptide in the precursors varies from 20 to 47. The length of the mature peptide is in the range from 46 to 60. Predicted mature defensins are basic peptides with pI from 7.23 to 9.93.</p><p>BLAST search in the NCBI database showed that 88.5% of DEFLs belonging to this group show sequence similarity to earlier isolated <italic>T. kiharae</italic> defensins, and defensins of <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, <italic>T. turgidum</italic>, <italic>T. urartu</italic>, <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> and <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>. The identity score varies from 61 to 99%.

However, their cysteine motifs, as well as their amino acid sequences show similarity to typical defensins (see below). A check with the CS-AMPPred program showed that all these peptides satisfied the criteria for AMPs.

Some sequences in each subgroup are virtually identical and differ in a single amino acid residue (see, for example DEFLs 1-1 and 1-34 in subgroup A and DEFLs 1-2 and 1-26 from subgroup C).

DEFLs from a wild cereal <italic>L. arenarius</italic> identified earlier were included for comparison. As it is seen from this figure, <italic>T. kiharae</italic> group 2 DEFLs form a family of closely related peptides. The peptides DEFL2-1 and DEFL2-2 differ in a single amino acid residue, and the peptides DEFL2-3 and DEFL2-4 vary at two positions in the predicted mature peptide region. It is of particular interest that peptides with the same cysteine motif were discovered earlier in <italic>L. arenarius</italic> using the whole-transcriptome sequencing approach (<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova, Shelenkov &#x00026; Odintsova, 2015</xref>).

This sequence conservation between two cereal species points to important common functions. It deserves noting that in the wheat transcriptomes, a sequence with the same 8-Cys motif comprising three consecutive cysteines that showed 100% similarity with a hypothetical protein from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>melonis</italic> was discovered (DEFL(Fo) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table&#x000a0;S4</xref>).

These DEFLs had no hits in the NCBI database, therefore, they are new proteins. All of predicted mature peptides are neutral, except for DEFL3-7, which is a basic peptide. According to the CS-AMPPred program, two of group 3 DEFLs (DEFL3-4 and DEFL3-5) were not AMPs, while the remaining DEFLs were assigned to AMPs. All except one member (DEFL3-1) produced no hits with known protein domains during InterProScan analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Table S5</xref>). It is of particular interest that the InterProScan program revealed a RING-type zinc finger domain in DEFL3-1. Znf motifs occur in different proteins and represent stable scaffolds that have evolved specific functions (IPR013083). They were shown to bind proteins, nucleic acids (RNA and/or DNA) and lipids.

It is interesting that sequence analysis for characteristic domains with InterProScan revealed that four group 4 DEFLs (DEFLs 4-16, 4-20, 4-34, and 4-35) belong actually to RALFs, small, cysteine-rich peptides involved in plant growth and development (<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Table S5</xref>). It is not surprising because Silverstein&#x02019;s cysteine motifs postulated for 4-cysteine DEFLs overlap with those for RALFs (<xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al., 2007</xref>). RALFs are synthesized as preproproteins containing an N-terminal signal peptide that is necessary for secretion and a C-terminal mature peptide with four cysteines forming two disulfide bonds. It should be noted that true RALFs possess two short conserved sequences that are important for their activity: the RRXL cleavage site and the YISY motif required for receptor binding (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Campbell &#x00026; Turner, 2017</xref>). All four DEFLs assigned to RALFs by InterProScan possess only the RRXL motif required for proteolytic processing of the precursor, while the second conserved YISY motif is missing, therefore, it seems more reasonable to describe these wheat peptides as RALF-related. Of group 4 DEFLs, 29 (69%) were predicted to be AMPs. The phylogenetic tree based on precursor sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-13">Fig. S5</xref>) separated these DEFLS according to sequence similarity into two large subgroups A and B with 15 and 7 members, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>), and three pairs of extremely similar DEFLs that differ in 1-3 amino acid residues (subgroups C, D, and F) (DEFL4-24 &#x02013; DEFL4-30, DEFL4-39 &#x02013; DEFL4-40, and DEFL4-31 &#x02013; DEFL4-6).

As it is seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-8">8</xref>, different states of wheat seedlings are characterized by distinct patterns of DEFL expression. The expression level of a set of DEFL genes did not change more than two-fold in all four transcriptomes (e.g., DEFLs 1-15, 2-3, 2-4, 4-1, 4-22, 4-30, 4-31, 5-4, 5-5, 5-6, 6-1, 6-3).

Expression of DEFL4-1 was confirmed by RT-PCR. Meanwhile this DEFL has no BLAST hits and is evidently a novel <italic>T. kiharae</italic> gene. Further studies of the role of this gene in wheat plant physiology are therefore of particular importance.

Analysis of wheat defensive compounds is, therefore, of prime importance for enhancing disease resistance and yields. However, the repertoire of DEFL genes in wheat has not been studied so far. In this work, we analyzed DEFL composition in the synthetic allopolyploid <italic>T. kiharae</italic>. This species is highly resistant to pathogens. Earlier, using a peptidomic approach we isolated 11 and sequenced 6 defensins from seeds of this species (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Egorov et al., 2005</xref>). However, the efficiency of biochemical methods for new DEFL discovery lags behind novel high-throughput NGS technologies. In this work, to explore the inventory of DEFL genes in <italic>T. kiharae</italic>, for the first time, global RNA sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly were performed. Several approaches for AMP mining in RNA-seq data were described (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000e2;ndido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova, Shelenkov &#x00026; Odintsova, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Porto, Pires &#x00026; Franco, 2017</xref>). In this work, to search for DEFL transcripts, an approach combining the method of hidden Markov models with that of regular expressions was used. To study the role of defensins in IR, wheat seedlings were treated with the elicitor metabolites of <italic>F. sambucinum</italic>, which, as we showed earlier, did not possess fungitoxic activity (<xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et al., 2011</xref>), but instead, acted as elicitors of induced resistance in <italic>T. aestivum</italic> against multiple fungal pathogens (<xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Shcherbakova et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). To shed light on the role of discovered DEFLs in IR, differential profiling of DEFL gene expression was performed in transcriptomes obtained from healthy, elicitor-treated, infected, and IR-expressing <italic>T. kiharae</italic> seedlings. It should be specifically noted that although analysis of global gene expression using NGS technologies is a powerful novel tool to study the interactions of plants with pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Knief, 2014</xref>), only single studies report transcriptional changes in AMP gene expression induced by pathogens and biocontrol agents (<xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Mondragon-Palomino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in the model plant <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> transcriptome analysis by microarray showed that the rhizobacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> WCS417, which induced systemic resistance in plants, locally in the roots caused changes in expression of 97 genes, however, no changes in expression level of about 8,000 genes were observed in leaves. Only after challenge with <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000, 81 gene was up-regulated in ISR-expressing plants, among them the defensin PDF1.2 (<xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Verhagen et al., 2004</xref>). In the transcriptomic analysis using RNA-Seq of <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> var. <italic>tumida</italic> Tsen responses to <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic> primed by the biocontrol strain <italic>Zhihengliuella aestuarii</italic>, up-regulation of six PR-proteins (five thaumatin family proteins and one LTP) in ISR-expressing plants induced by the biocontrol agent <italic>Z. aestuarii</italic> was shown. However, no changes in defensin gene expression were reported in this study (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using our pipeline of DEFL mining, as many as 143 DEFL transcripts were discovered in wheat transcriptomes. All DEFLs have either a CS &#x003b1;&#x003b2; motif common to defensins (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Cornet et al., 1995</xref>) or a &#x003b3;-core motif characteristic to all Cys-rich AMPs (<xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">Yount &#x00026; Yeaman, 2004</xref>). Thus, DEFL genes in wheat represent a multigene family. The vast majority of discovered <italic>T. kiharae</italic> DEFL genes represent novel genes. Only three DEFLs exhibited 100% similarity to the annotated genes in the databases. Sequence variation in discovered DEFLs is likely to be responsible for functional diversification of DEFLs. The discovery of a divergent DEFL multigene family in wheat is in accordance with previous data obtained for other plant species. Thus, <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (2007)</xref> using bioinformatics-based approaches identified 317 DEFL genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome and 93 DEFL genes in rice genome. Sixty-two DEFLs were reported in the maize genome (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2016)</xref> identified nine DEFL genes in the brachypodium genome, 12 in rice, 20 in maize and 10 in sorghum. Thirthy-seven DEFL genes were identified in our study by RNA-seq in the wild cereal <italic>L. arenarius</italic> (<xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova, Shelenkov &#x00026; Odintsova, 2015</xref>), and twenty-four DEFL genes were discovered in the weed species <italic>Stellaria media</italic> belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family (<xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> EST data revealed more than 300 nodule-specific DEFL genes (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Fedorova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Mergaert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2004</xref>). The number of discovered DEFLs in <italic>T. kiharae</italic> seedlings exceeds that detected in other cereals in genomic or EST data by bioinformatic techniques. The abundance of DEFL genes in <italic>T. kiharae</italic> is likely to be associated with the polyploid nature of this wheat species, with all three constituent genomes contributing DEFL genes to the polyploid.</p><p>We classified <italic>T. kiharae</italic> DEFLs identified in transcriptome data into 4 groups according to four cysteine motifs specified by <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (2007)</xref>. DEFLs with additional cysteines were assigned to groups 5&#x02013;10. In each group, subgroups of closely related peptides could be discriminated. Some sequences in each subgroup are virtually identical and differ in a single amino acid residue. Some DEFL genes encode identical defensins with variant signal peptides. Sequence similarity within subgroups of wheat DEFLs points to a significant role of duplications in the evolution of DEFL gene family, with high level of nucleotide identity observed in some instances indicating relatively recent duplications. These findings are consistent with the conclusions made by <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Silverstein et al. (2005)</xref> during the analysis of DEFL gene family in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> that evolution of DEFL genes occurred by successive rounds of tandem and segmental duplication followed by purifying or diversifying selection.</p><p>The classical defensins with the 8-Cys motif: CX{4,25}CX{2,12}CX{3,4}CX{3,17}CX{4, 32}CXCX{1,6}C represent the most numerous group 1 of <italic>T. kiharae</italic> DEFLs. Most DEFLs in this group show high sequence similarity and even identity at the amino acid level in the mature peptide region to defensins of <italic>Ae. tauschii</italic> and <italic>T. urartu</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12">Fig. S4</xref>). This is not surprising since these diploid species contributed their genomes (D and A, respectively) to the polyploid wheat genomes in the course of evolution.</p><p>It is worth noting that although <italic>T. kiharae</italic> group 1 DEFLs show high sequence similarity to defensins earlier isolated from seeds of this species (<xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Egorov et al., 2005</xref>), seed and seedling defensins represent different sets of peptides, confirming tissue-specific pattern of DEFL gene expression.</p><p>Comparison of classical (group 1) DEFLs with defensins from other cereals reveals groups of closely related peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12">Fig. S4</xref>). Of particular interest are defensins conserved among different Poaceae genera. For example, the mature defensin in <italic>T. kiharae</italic> DEFL1-16 is 100% identical to a defensin from <italic>H. vulgare</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/BAC07823.1">BAC07823.1</ext-link>) and DEFL3-2 from <italic>L.&#x000a0;arenarius</italic>. Such conservation of sequences points to their ancient origin in the common ancestor before the divergence of the genera <italic>Triticum</italic>, <italic>Hordeum</italic> and <italic>Leymus</italic> and highlights the vital immune functions of these molecules for grasses.</p><p>In <italic>T. kiharae</italic> transcriptomes we discovered 4-Cys containing DEFLs with a characteristic cysteine motif CX{3,5}CX{8,17}CX{4,6}C which we named group 4 DEFLs. It should be specifically emphasized that DEFLs with this cysteine motif were earlier discovered only in nodules of the galegoid legumes. They were shown to possess antimicrobial activity to protect nodules from the pathogens (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Mikul&#x000e1;ss et al., 2016</xref>) and supposed to play a role in bacterioid differentiation (<xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Mergaert et al., 2006</xref>). We showed that DEFLs with the same motif were well represented in wheat. We discovered as many as 42 DEFLs with this motif in wheat seedlings; furthermore, 38 DEFLs with this motif and additional cysteine residues in the mature peptide domain were also found in wheat (groups 5&#x02013;10). In addition, changes in expression of group 4 DEFL genes were shown upon treatment with <italic>F. sambucinum</italic> elicitors and pathogen infection, as well as in IR-expressing seedlings indicating their involvement in stress response and IR.</p><p>We did not check the antimicrobial activity of identified putative DEFLs. However, the predicted defensins from group 1 DEFLs most likely possess antimicrobial activity. Two lines of evidence support this suggestion. Firstly, they show high sequence similarity to defensins with proven antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12">Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, our antimicrobial assays of Tk-AMP-D1 defensin from wheat seeds showed that it inhibited growth of <italic>F.&#x000a0;graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. verticilloides,</italic> while Tk-AMP-D6 was active against <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> (<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Odintsova et al., 2008</xref>). A close relative of <italic>T. kiharae</italic> DEFL1-17, <italic>T. aestivum</italic> defensin TAD1 induced during cold acclimation in winter wheat suppressed growth of the snow mold fungus <italic>Typhula ishikariensis</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the causal agent of head blight (<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Defensins from the weed <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> displayed potent antifungal activity against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Odintsova et al., 2008</xref>). The corn defensin PDC1 inhibited growth of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Kant, Liu &#x00026; Pauls, 2009</xref>). The rice defensins DEF7 and DEF8 were effective against the bacteria <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> and <italic>X. campestris</italic> and the fungus <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (<xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Tantong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-71" ref-type="bibr">Weerawanich et al., 2018</xref>). Secondly, all group 1 DEFLs were checked with the CS-AMPPred program, and all of them were predicted to possess antimicrobial activity. However, to confirm antimicrobial activity, direct tests with isolated or recombinant defensins are nevertheless necessary. In addition to antifungal activity, on the basis of sequence similarity with cereal defensins that were shown to inhibit protein synthesis or insect &#x003b1;-amylases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12">Fig. S4</xref>), we may suggest the same functions for some wheat DEFLs. For example, subgroup B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12">Fig. S4</xref> comprises defensins that inhibit protein synthesis, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylases and sodium channels. We may suggest similar functions to defensins derived from DEFLs 1-12, 1-40, 1-41, and 1-43. ZmES1 from subgroup D inhibits protein synthesis. So, defensins of DEFLs 1-10, 1-13, 1-14, 1-29, 1-30, 1-42 may possess the same function, although sequence similarity within this subgroup is rather low. Thus, on the basis of structure similarity with defensins, whose functions were established, we may hypothesize diverse functions for discovered wheat DEFLs: antifungal, antibacterial, inhibition of insect &#x003b1;-amylases and protein synthesis.</p><p>In order to elucidate the role of DEFLs in the phenomenon of induced resistance, we performed differential expression profiling of DEFL genes in wheat seedlings infected with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, treated with FS-94 elicitors, pretreated with the elicitors and infected with the fungus (IR-displaying). Along with DEFL genes whose expression level did not change more than two-fold in all experimental set-ups, a portion of DEFL genes displayed differential expression pattern. We suppose that wheat DEFL genes irresponsive to treatments might not be involved in immune response, but in some other functions.</p><p>We discovered that infection with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> changed expression of about 16% of DEFL genes in wheat. Among them, more DEFL genes were down-regulated than up-regulated. It is noteworthy that during fungal infection, genes encoding DEFLs belonging to the same subgroup of similar peptides could display different expression pattern. For example, in subgroup B of group 1 DEFLs 1-11 and 1-12 were up-regulated, while DEFL1-22 was down-regulated. Up-regulation of DEFL genes may reflect activation of defense reactions in response to the pathogen, while down-regulation might manifest suppression of the immune response by the pathogen. It is of particular interest that suppression of DEFL gene expression in the weed <italic>S. media</italic> infected with the same fungus was observed in our previous work (<xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Slavokhotova et al., 2017</xref>). Similar results were obtained by <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Mondragon-Palomino et al. (2017)</xref> on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species infected with F. <italic>graminearum</italic>: the same portion as in wheat (about 16% of all DEFLs) of DEFL genes was differentially expressed in response to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> infection, with down-regulated genes representing the largest proportion of differentially expressed genes. Taken together, down-regulation of DEFL genes in plants infected by <italic>Fusarium</italic> species points to the existence of a conserved common mechanism deployed by the <italic>Fusarium</italic> fungi to inhibit defense responses in plants.</p><p>We showed that the elicitors from FS-94 induced expression of a whole panel of 24 DEFL genes in <italic>T. kiharae</italic> seedlings belonging to different structural subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-7">Table&#x000a0;S7</xref>).

Up-regulation of DEFL genes in wheat treated with FS-94 metabolites may reflect activation of the defense system by the elicitors. However, in addition to induction of DEFL genes by the elicitor, a certain portion of DEFLs were down-regulated.</p><p>In wheat seedlings pretreated with the elicitor and infected with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (IR-expressing seedlings), considerable changes in DEFL expression levels were recorded: expression of 50 DEFL genes changed compared to control seedlings. Of these, 26 DEFL genes were up-regulated and 24 DEFL genes were down-regulated. Six DEFLs were specifically up-regulated in IR-expressing seedlings, namely they were not activated either in elicitor-treated or in infected seedlings. Thus, we may suggest that these DEFLs were primed by FS-94 elicitors for expression after pathogen challenge. Priming, defined as physiological state that enables cells to respond to very low levels of a stimulus in a more strong and rapid manner than non-primed cells, is believed to be a critical process in different types of plant immunity (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Conrath, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, we discovered that treatment with <italic>F. sambucinum</italic> elicitors, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> infection, and infection of elicitor-pretreated <italic>T. kiharae</italic> seedlings results in up-regulation of different sets of DEFL genes. At the same time, different sets of DEFL genes are down-regulated. This may indicate that regulation of wheat DEFL gene expression occurs via different signaling pathways (JA/ET and SA-dependent), and cross-talk between these signaling pathways is observed. The work is now in progress to reveal transcriptional changes in SA, JA and ET-responsive genes in IR-expressing wheat seedlings to reveal signaling pathways involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our pipelines of DEFL mining proved highly efficient for identification of DEFL transcripts in wheat RNA-seq data. As many as 143 DEFL genes were identified in the wheat <italic>T. kiharae</italic> by global RNA sequencing; the vast majority of them represent novel genes. According to the number of cysteine residues and the cysteine motif, wheat DEFLs were classified into 10 groups. Within these DEFL groups, subgroups of similar sequences can be discriminated. Variation among DEFLs within subgroups is due to amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions of amino acid sequences. Mutations affecting cysteine residues, which change the number of cysteines and the cysteine motif in wheat DEFLs, were also discovered (see for example, group 9 and 10 DEFLs). Structural diversity of wheat DEFLs is supposed to give rise to their functional diversity. Most discovered DEFLs have a role in plant defense. This follows from their sequence similarity with antimicrobial defensins of other cereals and from up-regulation of their genes in response to fungal infection and treatment with IR elicitors. After confirmation of antimicrobial activity of wheat DEFLs by direct assays, future challenge is to identify the role of sequence variation in pathogen specificity. However, we cannot exclude that some identified DEFLs that were non-responsive to the above-mentioned treatments (e.g., group 2 DEFLs) or were down-regulated have non-defensive functions. In addition to structural diversification, transcriptional diversity of DEFL genes in wheat in response to the fungus, FS-94 elicitors, and the combination of both (elicitors + fungus) was demonstrated, with specific sets of DEFL genes up- and down-regulated in response to different treatments. Variation in expression patterns even between genes encoding structurally similar peptides was detected. We may suggest that transcriptional diversification of wheat DEFLs adds to their functional diversity. Thus, we showed that DEFLs in wheat represent a natural library of structurally and eventually functionally diverse biologically active peptides. Transcriptome profiling of wheat allowed us to gain insight into the mode of action of the elicitors from <italic>F. sambucinum</italic> strain FS-94<italic>.</italic> We discovered that the elicitors up-regulate a specific set of DEFL genes, which alone or together with other defense molecules including other AMPs contribute to enhanced disease resistance of the elicitor-pretreated plants. In addition to direct antimicrobial action of individual DEFLs, synergistic enhancement of their potency, as shown for AMPs, should also be taken into account. Besides providing a better understanding of the mode of action of the elicitors from FS-94 in controlling diseases, up-regulated IR-specific DEFL genes alone or in combination might be used for genetic transformation of plants to develop disease-resistant&#x000a0;crops.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title> Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.6125/supp-1</object-id><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Primers used for DEFL gene amplification</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-07-6125-s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.6125/supp-2</object-id><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Summary of transcriptome assemblies</title><p>*Combined assembly results from <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of reads from all 4 libraries.
