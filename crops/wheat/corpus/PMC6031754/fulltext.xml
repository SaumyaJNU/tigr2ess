Especially after N-rich crops like oilseed rape or field bean, nitrogen retention of the available soil N can be poor, and the risk of contamination of the hydrosphere with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and the atmosphere with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is high. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to preserve these unused N resources for subsequent agricultural production. High organic carbon soil amendments (HCA) like wheat straw promote microbial N immobilization by stimulating microbes to take up N from soil. In order to test the suitability of different HCA for immobilization of excess N, we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment with soil columns, each containing 8 kg of sandy loam of an agricultural Ap horizon. We created a scenario with high soil mineral N content by adding 150 kg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N ha<sup>-1</sup> to soil that received either wheat straw, spruce sawdust or lignin at a rate of 4.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>, or no HCA as control. Wheat straw turned out to be suitable for fast immobilization of excess N in the form of microbial biomass N (up to 42 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>), followed by sawdust. However, under the experimental conditions this effect weakened over a few weeks, finally ranging between 8 and 15 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> immobilized in microbial biomass in the spruce sawdust and wheat straw treatment, respectively. Pure lignin did not stimulate microbial N immobilization. We also revealed that N immobilization by the remaining straw and sawdust HCA material in the soil had a greater importance for storage of excess N (on average 24 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) than microbial N immobilization over the 4 months. N fertilization and HCA influenced the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea as the key players for nitrification, as well as the abundance of denitrifiers. Soil with spruce sawdust emitted more N<sub>2</sub>O compared to soil with wheat straw, which in relation released more CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a comparable overall global warming potential. However, this was counterbalanced by advantages like N immobilization and mitigation of potential NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> losses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>greenhouse gases</kwd><kwd>high organic carbon amendment</kwd><kwd>isotope labeling</kwd><kwd>microbial decomposition</kwd><kwd>nitrogen immobilization</kwd><kwd>nitrogen cycle</kwd><kwd>nitrogen fertilizer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002347</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">FKZ 031A561A</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">FZK 031A561C</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="58"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Global demands for nitrogen (N) in crop production have been 110 million tons in 2015. N demands are expected to increase to almost 119 million tons in 2020 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Tian, 2017</xref>). About one third of this amount is not directly assimilated by plants and, if not stored in the pedosphere, contaminates the hydrosphere with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and the atmosphere with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and nitric oxide (NO) (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Chen, 2002</xref>). N retention is of particular importance when residues of N-rich crops, such as field bean (<italic>Vicia faba</italic> L.), oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.), sugar beet (<italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> L.), and potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) are mineralized in soil. Such residues are substantial sources of mineral N, supplying between 20 and 60 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> to the soil, depending on the leaf and straw yield (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000f6;hler, 2009</xref>). Crop residues with a C:N ratio below 20&#x02013;25 are supposed to be mineralized more quickly than those with higher C:N ratios (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mooshammer et al., 2014</xref>). Sugar beet residues, for instance, with a narrow C:N ratio of 11 can be mineralized by up to 75% within the first 10 weeks after incorporation (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Whitmore and Groot, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In German crop rotations, oilseed rape is harvested already in July, often followed by winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), which is sown in September/October, but grows only very slowly until the following spring, associated with a correspondingly low N uptake of up to 30 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> during this period of time (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sieling et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, soil mineral N content after oilseed rape harvest sometimes exceeds 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Henke et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, about 50% of mineral N derived from decomposition of N-rich crops like oilseed rape can be lost from soil, particularly in sandy soil (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000f6;hler, 2009</xref>). <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Sieling and Kage (2006)</xref> reported annual soil mineral N losses via nitrate leaching of 44 or 73 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> after oilseed rape harvest and subsequent winter barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) or winter wheat cultivation from Germany. Annual N losses by N<sub>2</sub>O from long-term field experiments with oilseed rape in Germany ranged between 1.4 and 4.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, of which 53 to 81% occurred during the winter season (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser and Ruser, 2000</xref>). Thus, managing soil mineral N after harvest during times without sufficient winter crop N uptake is of great importance for reducing N losses and improving the agricultural N use efficiency (NUE) by achieving a similar quantity of N in the harvested crop by less N input (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Although this fact has been known for a long time, the nitrogen surplus is a persistent and pressing problem. Thus research efforts are needed to manage the fate of unused fertilizer N in crop production (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). Closing the post-harvest time gaps in crop rotations without N uptake by plants may help to retain N in soil for subsequent crop production.</p><p>It is known since long that N-poor crop residues such as wheat straw can cause a strong immobilization (or &#x0201c;lock&#x0201d;) of N, which means a reduction of plant-available N. It has been shown that available N in soil is immobilized after application of decomposable, C-rich organic residues with large C:N ratios, such as wheat straw (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Richards and Norman, 1931</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheshire et al., 1999</xref>), which might lower crop yield in the next season. <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Malhi et al. (2011)</xref>, however, proposed that well managed soils will benefit in the long term from retaining straw residues in the soil, thereby improving crop yield and plant N uptake. Nonetheless, if N immobilization interferes with plant growth, the probability is high that microorganisms are more competitive for nutrients than plants if plant and microbial N uptake occur simultaneously in the same soil volume (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hodge et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Organic substrates with large C:N ratios, such as wheat straw (C:N 50&#x02013;100), are required to promote microbial N immobilization, forcing microbes to take up N from soil, in order to maintain their C:N ratio at least ten times lower (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cleveland and Liptzin, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Scheller and Joergensen, 2008</xref>). However, large C:N ratios alone do not warrant intensive microbial growth and thus N immobilization, but serve as a rough indicator for its N immobilization potential. Spruce sawdust with a C:N ratio of 100 to 400 contains more recalcitrant compounds, leading to lower degradation rates and prolonged times of decay (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kostov et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, in order to immobilize N, two major requirements have to be fulfilled to stimulate growth of microbial decomposers: (1) sufficient available C as energy source; (2) sufficient available N and P to fulfill stoichiometric requirements and to avoid nutrient mining of original soil organic matter (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fontaine et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>High organic carbon amendments (HCA) consist of very different quantities and qualities of fast, moderately, and slowly degradable organic sub-fractions. Microorganisms respond very differently to these organic fractions, and microbial N immobilization can be expected to increase with increasing size and C:N ratio of the fast degradable fraction, which usually is degraded within a few days (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Plante and Parton, 2007</xref>). The fast degradable fraction contains easily soluble sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acids (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller et al., 1998</xref>). Such compounds are favorable for a rapid growth of zymogenous (fermentative) microorganisms (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya, 2015</xref>) with short half-lives of a few days (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cochran et al., 1988</xref>). Despite this fast turnover, C and N released by dead microbial biomass serve as additional substrates for microbes that grow more slowly on more complex organic compounds (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fontaine et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>More complex, polymeric components such as cellulose and hemicellulose are the dominating fraction of wheat straw. Investment in depolymerizing enzymes may reduce the microbial growth efficiency, but the large C:N ratio of this fraction and its accessibility to many soil microbes account for its N retention capacity (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Plante and Parton, 2007</xref>). Woody sawdust contains more recalcitrant compounds than wheat straw, mainly in the form of lignin. Specialists like white-rot fungi are needed to break up the lignified structures of wood (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">van Kuijk et al., 2017</xref>). However, this process is too slow to support significant microbial growth and, hence, fast microbial N immobilization. In addition to biotic N immobilization and N adsorption in soil, also less prominent ways of abiotic N immobilization were reported (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miyajima, 2015</xref>), e.g., the reaction of nitrite with HCA-derived lignin or its derivatives (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present work was to test the potential of different HCA for efficiently managing a post-harvest excess of soil mineral N in arable soil without sufficient plant N uptake. To this end, a static laboratory incubation study was conducted to answer the following research questions: (1) Can HCA with large C:N ratio such as wheat straw, spruce sawdust, and lignin help to manage temporal N excess in agricultural soil by inducing microbial growth at a relevant magnitude? (2) Can such HCA application strategies help improve the nitrogen retention capacity of the soil by reducing an unintended N loss in form of nitrate and greenhouse gases?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Soil and HCA</title><p>For the incubation study, substrate of a Cambic Luvisol soil type with sandy loam soil texture, containing 21% clay and 35% silt in the dry matter (dm) was used, sampled in summer of 2016 from the Ap horizon at the Hohenschulen experimental site, Achterwehr field (54&#x000b0;19&#x02032;05&#x02033;N, 9&#x000b0;58&#x02032;38&#x02033;E), Kiel, Germany. In 2015, 1 year before sampling, last crops were a mixture of catch crops like red clover (<italic>Trifolium pretense</italic> L.) and alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.) without any fertilization. In 2014, 2 years before sampling, maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) was grown, with typical slurry and triple superphosphate fertilization.</p><p>Results were recalculated on a kilogram per hectare basis using the following input parameters of the field site: 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; 0.2 m soil depth &#x000d7; bulk density of 1,500 kg m<sup>3</sup> = 3&#x022c5;10<sup>6</sup> kg dry soil ha<sup>-1</sup>.

Organic substrates were applied at a rate of 1.5 g C kg<sup>-1</sup> soil, equivalent to a field application of 4.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>. In total, wheat straw, spruce sawdust, and lignin treatments received 3.4, 3.3, and 2.4 g dm kg<sup>-1</sup>. At the beginning of the pre-incubation period, 90% of the HCA were mixed homogeneously with the soil and 10% was buried horizontally at a soil depth of 2 cm in litter bags made of 0.2 &#x003bc;m nylon meshes, a soil contact area of 36 cm<sup>2</sup>, and an average thickness of 0.25 cm after filling (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">S1</xref>). The particle size of the HCA applied to soil and litter bags ranged around 1 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Setup</title><p>A combined application of N fertilizer and organic application was used for the wheat straw (SWF = <underline>S</underline>oil + <underline>W</underline>heat straw + <underline>F</underline>ertilizer), spruce sawdust (SSF = <underline>S</underline>oil + <underline>S</underline>pruce sawdust + <underline>F</underline>ertilizer), and lignin (SLF = <underline>S</underline>oil + <underline>L</underline>ignin + <underline>F</underline>ertilizer) treatments. The control treatment (S = <underline>S</underline>oil) did not receive any fertilizer or HCA, the fertilizer control treatment (SF = <underline>S</underline>oil + <underline>F</underline>ertilizer) received only N fertilizer, but no HCA. Each treatment consisted of three independent replicates. Custom-made stainless steel incubation columns with a height of 30 cm, a diameter of 20 cm, and a detachable, unsegmented headspace unit were constructed by the workshop of Forschungszentrum J&#x000fc;lich, Germany (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">S1</xref>). On average, 8,000 cm<sup>3</sup> of headspace volume were achieved after connecting the headspace unit to the column, considering individual differences of each soil column, e.g., slightly deviating soil levels. Airtightness was achieved by a silicone rubber O-seal, embedded in cut grooves of the headspace and incubation column before screwed in place. Gas-tightness of the system was checked before the experiment, using helium and a helium detector.</p><p>Each soil column contained six equally spaced sections made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">S1</xref>), allowing sampling in time intervals without substantial disturbance of the soil structure. Void spaces after sampling where filled with solid PVC spacers to keep the gas sampling headspace at constant volume. 8 kg of soil was mixed with or without HCA before filling equal amounts of soil in each column section. Bulk density of the soil was adjusted to the field value of 1.5 g cm<sup>-3</sup> by using a special triangle-shaped tool that exactly fit into the column section. During the first 12 h of the pre-incubation period of 7 days before fertilizer application (DBF), soil was rewetted to a water volume equivalent of 40% of the water holding capacity measured in soil without HCA (WHC, 35 g H<sub>2</sub>O 100 g<sup>-1</sup> dm). Deionized H<sub>2</sub>O was dripped onto the soil surface in steps of maximal 50 ml to re-activate soil microorganisms before adding fertilizer N. To simulate an excess of soil mineral N, ammonium sulfate (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was applied as fertilizer with a <sup>15</sup>N content of 2.65 atom-% (corresponding to a &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N of about 6,400&#x02030;; VWR, Germany). The N fertilizer, equivalent to 50 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil and to 150 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, was dissolved in 100 ml deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to prepare a stock solution. After further dilution with deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, the N solution was poured stepwise onto the soil surface of the fertilized treatment, finally adjusting the water content to 60% WHC. Soil substrates of the control treatment (S) only received deionized H<sub>2</sub>O instead of N solution. Soil columns were incubated over a total of 120 days at room temperature from 11th November 2016 to 16th March 2017. Average temperatures during incubation ranged from 20.3 to 22.3&#x000b0;C. Soil moisture loss was monitored between the sampling dates by weighing the soil column, and gravimetrically after each sampling event. Soil moisture was kept in a range of 50 to 60% WHC by dripping deionized H<sub>2</sub>O equivalent to 7.5 ml d<sup>-1</sup> onto the soil surface of each sampling segment.

The clamp on the inlet tube was opened to allow pressure equilibration during each gas sampling. These intrusions of ambient air were considered before calculating the gas emission (Equation 1).

Cumulative N lost via N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from N-fertilized soil (SF) was 1.5 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> higher compared to the S treatment. The SWF and SLF treatment had both a cumulative N<sub>2</sub>O loss of 3.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, while the SSF treatment lost 4.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in the form of N<sub>2</sub>O compared to the S treatment. In relation to the S treatment, the overall GWP (CO<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>2</sub>O) of soils with N fertilization (SF) or with additional HCA increased in the following order: 140 (SF) &#x0003c; 545 (SLF) &#x0003c; &#x0003c; 2,060 (SSF) &#x0003c; 2,162 (SWF) kg CO<sub>2</sub>-C equivalents ha<sup>-1</sup>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>HCA-Derived N Immobilization</title><p>In our experiment, wheat straw, applied at a rate of 4.5 t C ha<sup>-1</sup>, increased N uptake by the microbial biomass up to 42 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> during a short period of time, before releasing two thirds of this amount again within the following 4 months of incubation at room temperature (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>). Such rapid N immobilization can also occur under field conditions after incorporation of organic C-rich crop residues (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Congreves et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, HCA might be suitable to retain mineral N quickly in times of maximum mineral N availability, with a potential of dosed N release to germinating crops applied together with HCA. Some plants, such as cereal rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.), root down to a soil depth of 15 cm within 4 weeks after sowing, effectively reducing the mineral N loss (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brinsfield and Staver, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Staver and Brinsfield, 1998</xref>) after its release from the microbial biomass. In contrast, winter wheat N uptake (30 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) is rather low during the winter season (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Henke et al., 2008</xref>), but might be large enough to buffer the release of approximately 27 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> from the wheat straw-derived microbial biomass during 4 months and under conditions optimal for microbial activity.</p><p>Our data also indicates that different types of HCA, such as wheat straw and spruce sawdust, have the potential to retain 15 and 9 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> for more than 4 months, which, together with the N uptake of winter crops, might compensate N surpluses typically found in post-harvest fields (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">D&#x000f6;hler, 2009</xref>). In the medium term, N immobilized by microbial biomass may reduce N fertilizer demand in the following growing season, increasing the NUE of crop production. However, this requires that the N retained by the HCA is also released at the appropriate time and rate in order to transfer N to the next crop, which might be not easy to achieve under realistic field conditions as indicated by reduced yield and N uptake in the subsequent crop season and consequently lower profit margins (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Christensen, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaves et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Congreves et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to the recommendations for appropriate mineral N application, choosing the right composition, amount, placement, timing (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bindraban et al., 2015</xref>), and the right particle size (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Angers and Recous, 1997</xref>) may improve the applicability of HCA to retain N in soil until the next growth season. Hence, the N immobilization-release dynamics of this study might differ from field conditions in view of the microbially favorable conditions applied in this study (60% WHC, room temperature), but might be at least partly reached in the field by using a comparably small HCA particle size (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Angers and Recous, 1997</xref>) like in our study, or by decreasing the depth of HCA incorporation into the soil (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, 1986</xref>) in order to enhance microbial activities.</p><p>A fast N release from the wheat straw-derived microbial biomass might be related to the zymogenous microbial biomass as pioneers of the microbial wheat straw decomposer succession (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bastian et al., 2009</xref>) with rather short half-life of a few days (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cochran et al., 1988</xref>), and a rapid decay after exhaustion of easily accessible HCA components. This decay appears to have initiated a second microbial N immobilization maximum at 49 DAF (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>). In contrast, no such N immobilization-release dynamics were observed after application of spruce sawdust, which showed a more stable microbial N immobilization at 7 DAF and afterward (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>). Hence, microbial N release in soil with wheat straw could be combined with the spruce sawdust-derived microbial N immobilization. A combination of HCA with similar organic composition such as wheat straw and spruce sawdust might help to mitigate the fast microbial N re-mineralization after wheat straw application. Furthermore, adding HCA with more recalcitrant organic composition such as spruce sawdust and lignin potentially improves global agricultural C sequestration in soil.</p><p>In our experiment, microbial N immobilization-release dynamics (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref></bold>) were also paralleled by physical and / or chemical sequestration of about 24 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in the remaining fraction of the wheat straw and spruce (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>). Also lignin was reported as matrix of chemical N fixation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2017</xref>), particularly if reactive N forms like nitrite are present as demonstrated also in our study (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref></bold>). However, no significant N sequestration was found in soil with pure lignin application (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>). We assume that chemical N fixation by lignin is coupled to HCA-derived microbial dynamics. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Miltner et al. (2012)</xref> provide strong evidence that disintegrating microbial populations are a relevant source of non-living soil organic matter. In accordance, we found indicators that a fast initial microbial growth based on easily available carbon derived from wheat straw was followed by such a rapid dieback of at least part of the microbial population. N derived from dead microorganisms, which does not directly serve as substrate for other microorganisms in the decomposer succession (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bastian et al., 2009</xref>), might be further transformed and fixed to recalcitrant organic molecules (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miyajima, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, N retained physically and / or chemically in the HCA matrix might be less available in the medium term, but incorporation of straw can improve crop yield and plant N uptake in the long term (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Malhi et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, wheat straw (39 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) and spruce sawdust (33 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) induced microbial, physical and / or chemical N immobilization at field-relevant timescale and quantity, with clear potential to improve agricultural NUE and N retention capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Impact of HCA on Greenhouse Gas Release and Nitrate</title><p>Decomposition of HCA applied in our experiment, as prerequisite for microbial N immobilization, increased CO<sub>2</sub> emission from soil over the runtime of the experiment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref></bold>). Inversely to the HCA-derived CO<sub>2</sub> emission, temporarily more C remained sequestered in soil with increasing recalcitrance of HCA to microbial decomposition. This makes spruce sawdust and lignin attractive to implement the recommendation of the <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">French Ministry of Agriculture (2015)</xref>, which aims to increase soil carbon stocks yearly by 4&#x02030;, helping to mitigate the adverse climatic influences of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Mixed applications of HCA types such as wheat straw and spruce sawdust may be of benefit in order improve the temporal C sequestration and in parallel also the NUE. In 2010, global agricultural application on average reached a NUE of 0.42, but an increase by more than 60% (NUE of 0.68) is needed to secure the same food status for 9.1 billion people as assumed for the year 2050 (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Managing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> seems particularly promising to improve NUE in crop production and N retention capacity, particularly in crop rotations with large potential N leaching losses of 44&#x02013;73 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, such as winter crops following oilseed rape (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Sieling and Kage, 2006</xref>). Our experiment showed a promising potential of wheat straw to instantaneously reduce the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration by 69 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in soil with high mineral N background (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref></bold>), providing sufficient availability of C and N as a requirement of microbial growth and N immobilization (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fontaine et al., 2004</xref>). Application of HCA also showed a potential to mitigate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> losses in cropping systems (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Congreves et al., 2013</xref>), however, previously retained N appears to be lost at a later stage, e.g., in the following post-harvest season, from sandy loam soil with annual average precipitation and temperature of 862 mm and 7.7&#x000b0;C, respectively (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Christensen, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Christensen, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Despite continuous NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> release of re-mineralized microbial N during the entire incubation, wheat straw, and less pronounced and delayed also spruce sawdust, tended to reduce soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> content at a field-relevant time scale. The observed NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mitigation might be a result of outcompeting nitrifiers and denitrifiers by zymogenous N immobilizers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burger and Jackson, 2003</xref>), as indicated by our data (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). Hence, HCA such as wheat straw and spruce sawdust with high C content have the potential to mitigate NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> losses if applied to soil in the right amount and under conditions suitable for large microbial competition for mineral N.</p><p>Another major source of critical N losses in agriculture with negative impact on NUE and climate change is the emission of N<sub>2</sub>O (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2017</xref>). In our experiment, spruce sawdust and wheat straw, as promising substrates for N immobilization, did not decrease N<sub>2</sub>O emission (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref></bold>). Most of the N<sub>2</sub>O emission was associated with the mineral NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> excess directly after fertilization. Ammonia oxidation, as part of nitrification, likely was the main source of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in our well-aerated soil (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mathieu et al., 2006</xref>). Transfer of the <sup>15</sup>N signal from the fraction of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref></bold>) also underlines the importance of nitrification for the observed N<sub>2</sub>O emissions after fertilization with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, which as an autotrophic process is fairly independent from the type of organic carbon amendment. Also nitrification after mineralization of N-rich crops such as lettuce can cause large N<sub>2</sub>O emissions of 1.1 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> within a short period of time (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baggs et al., 2000</xref>). NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> as potential substrate for denitrification was not limited during the entire incubation period and obviously had no relevant influence on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from our well-aerated soil. Nonetheless, remaining NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> might be problematic in the winter season under field conditions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser and Ruser, 2000</xref>), particularly in almost water-saturated soils after fertilization, after incorporation of crop residues, but also after weather-induced pulses of N mineralization (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Microbial N turnover occurs in soils particularly during times of microbial biomass decay, providing mineralized N to nearby nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Thus, only HCA with high C availability, such as wheat straw, temporarily tend to reduce nitrification-derived N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref></bold>) by increasing the microbial competition of N<sub>2</sub>O-producers with fast growing microorganisms with large N immobilization rates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Burger and Jackson, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, our data shows that this only leads to an increase of N<sub>2</sub>O emission at a later stage, when part of the HCA-derived microbial biomass becomes mineralized again.</p><p>A complete denitrification of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> might be another option to reduce problematic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In the mid-term, soil with spruce sawdust induced a larger abundance of denitrifiers harboring the <italic>nosZ</italic> gene, which codes the transformation of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub>, however, not early enough to mitigate the initial N<sub>2</sub>O peak. Hence, soil amended with spruce sawdust emitted more N in form of N<sub>2</sub>O compared to all other soil treatments in our study, resulting in an overall GWP of CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from soils with spruce sawdust comparable to wheat straw, which in relation released more CO<sub>2</sub>, but less N<sub>2</sub>O. We assume that HCA, such as wheat straw and sawdust, do not have a great potential to mitigate N<sub>2</sub>O emission at a field-relevant scale, which is in line with previous findings (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Frimpong and Baggs, 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We hypothesized that HCA such as wheat straw, spruce sawdust, and lignin have the potential to manage temporal N excess by inducing microbial growth at a field-relevant scale. We conclude that HCA based on wheat straw or similar material can be particularly effective in buffering an excess of N at a field-relevant scale in a short period of time (days), as often reported for post-harvest sugar beet and oilseed rape fields. N immobilization benefits might be optimized by combining HCA with properties similar to wheat straw and spruce sawdust. In our experiment, wheat straw and spruce sawdust were capable of retaining N long enough within the microbial and HCA residue pool to serve as additional N supply for the following crop growth next spring. A prerequisite of N immobilization is microbial activation by HCA, which cannot be induced by applying very recalcitrant HCA types such as lignin. Furthermore, we hypothesize that HCA mitigates N losses in form of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Application of HCA such as wheat straw and spruce sawdust to mineral N-rich soil temporarily increases CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, which were, however, counterbalanced by advantages such as N immobilization and mitigation of the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loss potential. We conclude that HCA applications can be part of a whole set of novel agricultural cultivation strategies to improve NUE of agricultural production, without losing agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, further research is needed to optimize HCA amount, composition, and particle size for particular crop rotations and N fertilization regimes to ensure appropriate immobilization and re-release of N at the right time and at the required rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RR and NB wrote the manuscript.
