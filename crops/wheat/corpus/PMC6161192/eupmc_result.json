    "The post-zygotic reproductive isolation (RI) in plants is frequently based on the negative interaction of the parental genes involved in plant development. Of special interest is the study of such types of interactions in crop plants, because of the importance of distant hybridization in plant breeding. This study is devoted to map rye genes that are incompatible with wheat, determining the development of the shoot apical meristem in wheat⁻rye hybrids. Linkage analysis of microsatellite loci, as well as genes of embryo lethality (Eml-R1) and hybrid dwarfness (Hdw-R1) was carried out in hybrids of Chinese Spring wheat with recombinant inbred lines as well as interline rye hybrids. Eml-R1 and Hdw-R1 could be mapped proximal and distal of two closely linked EST-SSR markers, Xgrm902 and Xgrm959, on rye chromosome 6R. Both rye genes are located on a segment of chromosome 6R that contains a breakpoint of evolutionary translocation between the ancestral chromosomes of homeologous groups 6 and 3. The obtained results are discussed in relation to genes interacting in developmental pathways as a class of causal genes of RI."
