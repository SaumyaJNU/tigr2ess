In a first wheat crop, take-all inoculum will begin to build up in the soil and then can cause severe disease in second and subsequent wheat crops. The fungus spreads across the root surface by means of runner hyphae. Infection hyphae can subsequently invade the root and destroy the root vascular tissue (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Skou, 1981</xref>), leading to the formation of black necrotic lesions that disrupt water and nutrient uptake (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Pillinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Severe root disease causes several above-ground symptoms including stunted plants, lack of grain formation, and premature ripening of the grain, which results in a loss in both grain quality and potential yield.</p><p>Historically there has been considerable interest in the biological control of take-all disease using bacterial and fungal species naturally occurring in the soil (reviewed by <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Wong, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Hornby <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Weller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cook, 2003</xref>). However, successful biological control under field conditions has often been difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the soil environment and difficulties in establishing sufficient populations of beneficial microorganisms for consistent and effective control.</p><p>Closely related fungal species within the Magnaporthaceae family have previously been implicated in the suppression of take-all disease. For example, <italic>Gaeumannomyces hyphopodioides</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Restrepo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) (previous names <italic>Phialophora radicicola</italic>, <italic>Phialophora</italic> sp. lobed hyphopodia and <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> var. <italic>graminis</italic>) occurs naturally in UK grasslands (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Deacon 1973</xref>) and is known to suppress take-all disease in wheat in both glasshouse and field experiments (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Speakman and Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Martyniuk and Myskow, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Field trials conducted in Poland (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Martyniuk and Myskow, 1984</xref>) and Australia (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Southwell, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) examined the effect of artificial inoculation of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> to the soil to protect wheat crops against take-all. However, only varying success was reported. <italic>Gaeumannomyces hyphopodioides</italic> protects wheat roots against take-all infection by inducing host resistance (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Speakman and Lewis, 1978</xref>). A related unnamed Magnaporthaceae species (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Restrepo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) has previously been isolated from fields in the UK (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Bateman, 1999</xref>) and in Germany (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), but it is not known if this species can suppress take-all disease.</p><p>In this study, we explore the effect of cereal and cultivar genotype on the root colonization ability of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> and the related Magnaporthaceae species with the aim of understanding whether host genetics can be utilized to support natural populations of these fungal species in field soil.</p><p>The specific aims of this study were 4-fold. First, our aim was to develop a new arable-derived collection of potentially beneficial fungal root colonizers (<italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> and related species) and compare this with the existing arable and grassland collection reported by <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Restrepo <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref>. Secondly, we wanted to establish a seedling bioassay with artificial fungal inoculum addition under controlled environment conditions, to explore their root colonization ability on different cereal species. A range of cereal genotypes were evaluated including oats, rye, triticale, and wheat. These were included to compare levels of colonization found for both the potentially beneficial fungal species and the take-all fungus. Thirdly, we aimed to explore whether there were any differences in the ability of current commercial UK winter wheat cultivars to support populations of beneficial root colonizers in a naturally <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic>-infested first wheat field site. To achieve this, a post-harvest soil core bioassay, baited with a single cultivar (Hereward), was used to gauge the amount of infective fungal inoculum. Fourthly, we wanted to investigate whether different commercial cultivars varied in their ability to be colonized by <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> in the seedling soil core bioassay. Post-harvest soil cores were baited with the same field plot cultivar and compared with the cores baited with Hereward.</p><p>In the naturally infested <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> field site, the results obtained indicate that a series of complex host&#x02013;microbe interactions exist, but that certain elite wheat genotypes when grown in either a first or second rotational position lead to either medium levels or very low levels of root colonization by this beneficial species. This provides an important resource for studies into the genetic and mechanistic basis of the interaction as well as potentially providing a novel way of introducing and supporting populations of this fungus under field conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Fungal isolations</title><p>Isolates of the required species were gathered post-harvest from three commercial wheat fields and one commercial barley field across the Rothamsted Farm (Hertfordshire, UK), to create an isolate collection and for the establishment of the seedling pot bioassay. The field sites had previous histories of natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> and related species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Soil cores were taken (between 50 and 100 depending on field size) and baited from the four fields as described for the take-all soil core bioassay (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

Plates were incubated at 21 &#x000b0;C and cultures resembling <italic>Gaeumannomyces</italic> species were plated onto fresh PDA amended with penicillin and streptomycin, and incubated for 2 weeks. Fungal cultures were then transferred onto fresh PDA plates without antibiotics, incubated until plates were confluent, and then stored at 4 &#x000b0;C. For long-term storage, cultures were maintained as agar plugs in sterile distilled water as described previously (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Boesewinkel, 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Species identification</title><p>To confirm species identity, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing was carried out.

A range of cereal genotypes were evaluated including those used as controls in the take-all seedling pot bioassay: oats (cv. Gerald, immune to take-all), rye (cv. Carotop, highly resistant to take-all), triticale (cv. Trilogie, moderately resistant to take-all), and hexaploid wheat (cv. Hereward, highly susceptible to take-all) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Additional hexaploid wheat genotypes were the spring wheat commercial cultivar Paragon and the Watkins landrace line 1190777; Paragon is susceptible to take-all whilst Watkins line 1190777 is partially resistant to take-all (VM, unpublished data), and the <italic>Triticum monococcum</italic> genotypes MDR037 (susceptible to take-all) and MDR046 (moderately resistant to take-all) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Hereward was also used as a negative control in both pot bioassays with non-inoculated PDA.</p><p>A randomized block design was calculated in GenStat (VSNI, Hemel Hempstead, UK) (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Payne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and included three inoculated replicates for each treatment. Soil (type: typical Batcombe) was collected in September 2013 from Great Harpenden I field (after oats) on the Rothamsted Farm, crumbled, mixed and then stored at room temperature before use in the seedling pot bioassay. Plastic drinking cups (7.5 cm diameter &#x000d7; 11 cm height, drilled with four drainage holes, 3 mm diameter) were filled with a 50 cm<sup>3</sup> layer of damp coarse sand and then a 150 g layer of soil. PDA plate inoculum was prepared by macerating 1/6th of a confluent PDA plate of either <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> or the Magnaporthaceae sp. with soil, equating to a ~25 g layer. The negative control pots were prepared by macerating 1/6th of a non-colonized PDA plate with soil. A further 50 g of prepared soil was added on top. The soil was lightly watered and 10 seeds of each cultivar were placed on the soil surface. Seeds were covered with a ~2 cm layer of horticultural grit and the pots were placed in a controlled-environment room (16 h day, 15 &#x000b0;C day/10&#x000b0;C night, twice weekly watering) for 5 weeks. After 5 weeks, the roots were washed free of soil and immersed in a white dish to examine the roots visually for colonization by looking for the presence of subepidermal vesicles. The total number of plants and roots and the number of colonized plants and roots were recorded to calculate the percentages of plants and roots infected.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Field trials</title><p>Two field trials, to evaluate the ability of elite UK winter wheat cultivars to support natural populations of the <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> fungus under a first wheat crop, were established in autumn 2014 and 2015. The two small plot field trials were established in two different parts of the same field, known to have underlying natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic>, on the Rothamsted Farm (Hertfordshire, UK) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The soil is flinty clay loam soil of the typical Batcombe soil series. The experimental field trials consisted of randomized block designs of five replicates of 40 elite wheat cultivars. The elite wheat cultivars consisted of 36 winter wheat cultivars on the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) 2013/2014 Recommended List (RL) and two winter wheat cultivars (Evolution and Zulu) on the AHDB 2014/2015 RL. In addition two control cultivars were included, the spring wheat cultivar Cadenza and the winter wheat cultivar Hereward, both with known take-all inoculum-building phenotypes (low and high, respectively) (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The two field trials were grown as first wheat crops, after a 1 year break crop of winter oilseed rape (2014), the second after winter oilseed rape and then spring oats (2015).

The method involved baiting soil cores with wheat seedlings, and fungal colonization was then assessed visually after 5 weeks growth in the controlled-environment room. The baited wheat seedlings effectively represent a subsequent second wheat crop. Six soil cores (5.5 cm diameter by 10 cm depth) were taken post-harvest in a zig&#x02013;zag transect from different rows across individual plots using a soil auger. Three of the soil cores were watered and 10 seeds of the winter wheat cultivar Hereward (RAGT, Cambridge, UK) were placed on the surface of each of the cores to gauge the amount of infective fungal inoculum after growth of current commercial cultivars. Ten seeds of the field plot cultivar were placed on the surface of each of the three remaining soil cores to test for the possibility of wheat genotype&#x02013;fungal colonization interactions. After 5 weeks growth, the plant roots were washed free of soil and immersed in water in a white dish to examine the roots visually for <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> colonization. Any <italic>G. tritici</italic> lesions were also recorded to identify whether take-all fungal inoculum could build up in a field with underlying <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> populations. The percentage of colonized roots was calculated for the two baiting methods and to gauge the amounts of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> or <italic>G. tritici</italic> inoculum that were supported under each wheat cultivar for the Hereward baiting. Cultures were isolated from colonized root tissue from soil core bioassay seedling plants, as detailed in the previous pot bioassay fungal isolation methodology, to confirm visual assessments that <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> was the species present.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The colonization percentages were always transformed using the logit transformation to ensure equal variance.

A ~50% level of colonization of the roots for the wheat cultivar Hereward was reached, providing a benchmark to allow good discrimination.

A seedling pot bioassay with artificial inoculum addition then revealed that there were differences in the susceptibility of five cereal species at the seedling stage to the two fungal species. The winter wheat cultivar Hereward was found to be highly susceptible in the artificial pot bioassay to both fungal species, and was subsequently chosen to be used as the baiting cultivar in the seedling soil core bioassay to test the difference between cultivars in their ability to support <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> inoculum under field trial conditions. There was some evidence of a difference between cultivars in their ability to support <italic>G</italic>. <italic>hyphopodioides</italic> inoculum under the first wheat crop (gauged using Hereward as the baiting cultivar), although this was not very consistent across the two trial years, indicating a strong genotype&#x000d7;environment component. In contrast, there were more consistent differences between cultivars in the ability of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> to colonize seedlings in the soil core bioassay, when baited with the field plot cultivar. We discovered that by changing the hexaploid wheat cultivar used as the bait in the soil core bioassay, the level of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization was often altered. Collectively, these new results provide valuable information on how beneficial soil-dwelling fungi can be encouraged to proliferate in arable soils to benefit wheat root health and hence grain production.</p><p>The first aim of the study was to gather an isolate collection from arable fields on an experimental farm in south-east England. There was a higher recovery of isolates of the <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> species compared with the unnamed Magnaporthaceae sp. The two species were only recovered together from one field, whereas in two other fields only <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> was recovered. No isolates were recovered from the fourth sampled field (Great Knott III) where beneficial Magnaporthaceae sp. had previously been visually identified ~8 years previously (VM, personal communication). No isolates of <italic>Slopeiomyces cylindrosporus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Klaubauf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) (anamorph: <italic>Phialophora graminicola</italic>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Walker, 1980</xref>), previously isolated and studied in Rothamsted field trials (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Gray, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), were isolated. Collectively these results indicate that the populations of these soil-dwelling beneficial fungal species are not static.</p><p>The 47 <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> isolates gathered from the various sites/trials across the Rothamsted Farm were found to be highly conserved across the ITS region. This isolate collection is an important resource for future studies. Experiments are already underway to sequence and fully assemble the genomes of different Magnaporthaceae species within the collection, and comparative studies with <italic>G. tritici</italic> should permit an improved understanding of the key differences between these closely related soil-dwelling beneficial and pathogenic species. The isolate collection could also be used to design a species-specific diagnostic assay to allow the identification of the different beneficial fungi present in arable fields.</p><p>The isolate collection was further used in the current study to establish a seedling pot bioassay under controlled environmental conditions, with the aim of exploring the root colonization of different cereal species by non-pathogenic soil-borne Magnaporthaceae species. Triticale had a high level of colonization for both fungi, whereas triticale is moderately resistant to the take-all fungus (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The remaining cereal genotypes, including the ancestral wheat relative <italic>T. monococcum</italic> (A<sup>m</sup> genome), the hexaploid wheat landrace Watkins 1190777, and the semi-modern elite spring and winter wheat genotypes appeared to be equivalent in their level of fungal colonization at the seedling stage. This result suggests that fungal colonization by beneficial <italic>Gaeumannomyces</italic> species has not been significantly altered by intensive wheat breeding activities. Rye had a low level of root colonization by the unnamed Magnaporthaceae sp., suggesting that rye could be activating a similar defence mechanism against the fungus to that observed with take-all (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Rothrock 1988</xref>). The na&#x000ef;ve soil used to establish all the pot bioassays was not sterilized, which explains why very low levels of visible subepidermal vesicles could be found on the roots of the non-inoculated Hereward control roots.</p><p>The third aim of this study was to investigate whether there were any differences in the ability of current commercial UK winter wheat cultivars to support natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> in the field in a first wheat situation. The two years of Hereward baiting data revealed that there were differences in the ability of the elite wheat cultivars to support <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> inoculum under a first wheat crop. However, there were inconsistencies in the level of root colonization for cultivars between the two years, highlighting a genotype&#x000d7;environment interaction. The higher level of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization in the 2016 field trial suggests that the 2015&#x02013;2016 season was more environmentally conducive to supporting natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic>. Weather conditions in 2015 consisted of a wet spring and summer compared with a drier spring and summer in 2016 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S10</xref>). This contrasts with take-all disease which is generally favoured by warmer winters and wet springs/summers. Alternatively, differences in field site location may account for differences in levels of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> inoculum between the two years.</p><p>The wheat genotype&#x02013;<italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> interaction detected in aim three of this study complements an earlier study that had identified consistent differences in the ability of wheat cultivars to build up take-all (<italic>G. tritici</italic>) inoculum under a first wheat crop, named the take-all inoculum build-up (TAB) trait (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">McMillan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, there was no clear correspondence between the previously described TAB phenotypes of Cadenza and Hereward, low and high TAB, respectively, and their ability to support populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> in this study (11.9% and 14.7% of roots colonized with <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> when baited with Hereward in the soil core bioassay; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>)</p><p>Finally, the fourth aim was to establish whether there was any interaction between second wheat cultivar choice and level of root colonization by <italic>G. hyphopodioides.</italic> The majority of cultivars were found to support low levels of root colonization when the field plot cultivar represented the subsequent second wheat, rather than Hereward. However, significant interactions were also evident. Nine cultivars across the two years consistently exhibited the ability to support medium levels of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization, independent of second wheat choice. For example, the elite cultivars Scout and KWS Kielder showed the highest level of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization, regardless of the second wheat cultivar choice. On the one hand, the cultivar Alchemy consistently had the lowest level of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization across the two second wheat cultivar choices, while on the other hand cultivars Zulu, Leeds, and KWS Croft indicated contrasting results from the two baiting methods.</p><p>Collectively, these data provide the first evidence for complex host genotype&#x02013;<italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> interactions occurring under both arable field conditions and in the 5 week seedling pot bioassay. The seedling pot bioassay screened a wide variety of cereal germplasm and cultivars, both modern and historical, yet there was little difference in the ability of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> to colonize the roots of this diverse wheat germplasm under artificial conditions. The soil core bioassay from the experimental field trials screened less diverse modern wheat cultivars and revealed statistically significant differences in the ability of these cultivars to be colonized and also to support natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> in the soil. These data suggest that wheat plants at the seedling stage may differ in their interaction with <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> during root colonization compared with adult plants in the field. The significantly different results obtained using the two baiting methods supports the suggestion that the presence of fungal inoculum (measured using Hereward as the baiting cultivar) is a trait independent of seedling root colonization. It is highly likely that the two phenomena are controlled by different mechanisms and may involve interactions with other soil-dwelling microbes and/or root exudates.</p><p>High extrapolated yield data were calculated for both field experiments (2015 range, 17.83&#x02013;25.57 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>; 2016 range, 12.68&#x02013;22.93 t ha<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). There appears to be no strong evidence of a detrimental effect of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> colonization on the yield of the plots. This complements field trials conducted in Australia investigating the cross-protection of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> against take-all disease (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>One <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> isolate has been patented for take-all control in Australia (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Wong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). No commercial use has been documented, and pelleting wheat seeds with <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> is not currently utilized as a method of biological control against take-all disease. The percentage of UK fields that contain this beneficial organism is unknown. However, this soil-borne species has been documented worldwide, including the USA, Australia, Poland, and Germany, and was identified in three of the four suppressive field sites on the arable farm used for this study. The ability of elite winter wheat cultivars to support and be colonized by natural populations of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> under a first wheat crop suggests important host genotype&#x02013;fungus interactions which, if harnessed, could potentially provide an additional management strategy, not only in the UK, to help combat take-all root disease in second wheats.</p><p>From a wheat breeding perspective, there does not appear to be any interaction between <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization and the National Association of British and Irish Flour Millers (nabim) groupings or pedigrees of the elite wheat cultivars. For example, the Robigus pedigree is found in several cultivars within the AHDB 2013/2014 RL and lines from the 2014/2015 RL winter wheat cultivars, yet there appear to be no similarities across these cultivars in their level of <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic> root colonization with either of the second wheat cultivar choices. This suggests that the trait is not under simple genetic control and could also be influenced by environmental factors such as soil type and soil moisture, and biological factors such as the overall make-up of the rhizosphere/soil microbiome. However, consistent differences across the two field seasons were observed for a subset of nine cultivars, suggesting that suitable mapping populations could be generated to investigate the genetic basis of these interactions.</p><p>In summary, this is the first report of two robust field trial data sets that have revealed that UK elite winter wheat cultivars differ in their ability to support and be colonized by natural populations of the take-all root disease-suppressing fungus, <italic>G. hyphopodioides</italic>, under a first wheat crop. Although there were some clear inconsistencies between field seasons, this dual data set reveals that a subset of nine elite UK winter wheat cultivars consistently supported fungal inoculum and seedling root colonization by <italic>G. hyphopodioides.</italic> These cultivars have the potential to be used to encourage populations of introduced or resident beneficial fungi for the control of take-all disease in short wheat rotations. Further research is now required to explore the genetic and mechanistic basis of this interaction and the influence of environmental and genetic factors on soil population establishment, root colonization, and take-all control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
