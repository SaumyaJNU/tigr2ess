This study was aimed at understanding the nutritional and product making potential of our advanced, high yielding and regionally adapted colored wheat lines. Our results indicated that our advanced colored wheat lines exhibited higher anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity than donor wheat lines and it varied in the order of white&#x0003c;purple&#x0003c;blue&#x0003c;black wheat. UPLC chromatogram revealed that anthocyanin composition and peak pattern is not only dependent on donor genotype but also background of recipient genotype. Interestingly, the purple wheat extract showed highest anti-inflammatory effect and followed the trend of white&#x0003c;blue&#x0003c;black&#x0003c;purple. Nutritional (carbohydrates, sugar, protein, ash, dietary fibre and vitamins) and processing parameters in relation to end-use quality (SDS sedimentation, gluten content, alveograph) of advanced colored lines were similar to high yielding white wheat cultivar. Colored wheat lines showed high iron and zinc content compared to white wheat indicating double bio-fortification. Therefore, our advanced colored wheat lines with high anthocyanin, iron and zinc contents showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and possessed desirable features for product making and commercial utilization.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Institutional (NABI) Core Fund for the project &#x0201c;Improvement of nutritional and processing quality in wheat&#x0201d; was utilized for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the article and its supporting information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the article and its supporting information.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cereals take an important place among all the food items and play key role for a healthy diet. Among the cereals, wheat is the leading one, devoted to multiple uses such as bread, noodles and biscuits. Wheat is a good source of starch, proteins, minerals and dietary fibre and is major contributor towards daily caloric requirements of wheat consuming population. Further enhancement in its nutritional value is expected to increase consumer demands regarding health, nutrition and convenience. Several crops with nutraceutical value are being commercially utilized in several countries across the world, e.g. quality protein maize with high lysine and tryptophan content [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], purple colored carrots [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], potatoes, sweet potatoes and maize [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with high anthocyanin content.</p><p>Anthocyanins have evoked the interest of number of researchers. Anthocyanins are normal constituents in colored fruits and vegetables. These can act as antioxidants and help in prevention of cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], inflammation, cancer [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], obesity [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and aging [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Common wheat cultivars across the world are white (amber) in color. The colored wheat, rich in anthocyanin is quite uncommon. Purple color is localized to the pericarp [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] whereas blue color to the aleurone [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Black wheat resulted by the combination of genes for both purple and blue colors. Colored wheat has attracted the attention of many breeders across the world but these lines exhibit low yield due to linkage drag [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have developed colored wheat lines with satisfactory yield potential and regional adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In this manuscript we have characterized these lines, with respect to colored donor and recipient high yielding white wheat lines. Colored wheat lines were characterized for anthocyanin content and antioxidant activities. For validation of health claiming benefits of color wheat lines, its anti-inflammatory effect was studied using macrophage cell line model. For assessment of bread making quality, chemical composition of colored advanced lines including minor components (minerals and vitamins) and rheological parameters were evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Plant material included one white wheat (cv, PBW621), three colored donor wheat lines (purple, blue, black) and three high yielding colored advanced breeding lines (purple, blue, black) selected from back crossed filial generations (BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) of cross between white and donor colored wheat lines.

For alveograph, lowest value was observed in black donor line with lowest protein content, SDS sedimentation value and gluten content.

Anthocyanins are water soluble pigments that belong to class flavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Later is part of polyphenols and include anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, flavanones and flavanols. Polyphenols include phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and lignans. The most common white wheat grains are rich source of phenolic acids most abundant being ferulic acid that acts as a potent antioxidant [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore antioxidant activity of white wheat is majorly associated with its phenolic acids and in colored wheat, additional effect is due to high anthocyanin content. Both phenolic and anthocyanin contents were estimated in the current study. Phenolic content of colored wheat lines was significantly higher than white wheat line, but there were no significant differences in the phenolic content among different colored wheat lines under study. On the other hand, there was a definite trend in the anthocyanin content, among different colored wheat lines black&#x0003e;blue&#x0003e;purple&#x0003e;white. This indicated that anthocyanin and phenolic content are unrelated and we can estimate antioxidant activity contributed by anthocyanins.</p><p>Antioxidant activity includes scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS&#x02014;O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, RO&#x000b7;, ROO&#x000b7;, OH&#x000b7;, HOCl&#x000b7;), reactive nitrogen species (RNS&#x02014;NO&#x000b7;, ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), reducing capacity; metal chelating capacity; activity as anti-oxidative enzyme; inhibition of oxidative enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There are different methods for estimation of scavenging of each type of free radical by different antioxidants. We used four different methods for antioxidant activity estimation: DPPH, ABTS, PCL and NO assays. Highest positive correlation was observed between anthocyanin content and PCL assay. The correlation of TAC with other methods was also positive but relatively lower. For SPC highest positive correlation was observed with DPPH assay but it was not to the level of TAC&#x02014;PCL assay. Ours results indicated that antioxidant activity of colored wheat is associated with its anthocyanin content in first place and increased phenolic content in second place. There had been some disagreement about the relationship between phenolic content, anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There are different methods for estimation of scavenging of each type of free radical and it can be misinterpreted depending upon the method used. In DPPH assay (DPPH&#x000b7;+RH = DPPHH+R&#x000b7;), nitrogen centered stable DPPH free radical is reduced by receiving hydrogen atom from hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In ABTS assay (ABTS<sup>+</sup>&#x000b7;+e<sup>-</sup> = ABTS, ABTS<sup>+</sup>&#x000b7;+RH = ABTS<sup>+</sup> +R&#x000b7;), nitrogen centered cation ABTS free radicle is reduced by receiving electron and hydrogen atom from both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. Both DPPH and ABTS assays do not measure antioxidant activity against biologically relevant radicles. Both methods are easy and extensively used for antioxidant assays. But our study indicated poor correlation between these assays and anthocyanin content. Their correlation with phenolic content was relatively better.</p><p>In PCL assay (L<sup>-</sup>&#x000b7;+O<sub>2</sub> = LO<sup>2-</sup>) carbon centered luminol radical reacts with oxygen to form biologically relevant peroxyl radical, production of later is prevented by hydrophilic antioxidants. Anthocyanins are hydrophilic polyphenols and highly soluble in water. Aqueous solubility of different phenolic acids is different and most abundant phenolic acid in wheat i.e. ferulic acid has low solubility in water [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, PCL assay was predicted as best method for anthocyanin based antioxidant activity estimation in our study.</p><p>Characterization of anthocyanins by using liquid chromatography is an authenticate method and the observed peak patterns of different color wheat lines provide us the insight of anthocyanin composition. Previous studies have indicated that cyanidin 3-glucoside was a major anthocyanin in purple wheat [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] while delphinidin 3-glucoside as principal component in blue wheat [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194367.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There had been conflicting reports on major anthocyanin derivatives found in colored wheat. Some reports mention Cy 3-glu as major anthocyanin in purple wheat while others Cy 3-rut [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results indicated that Cy 3-rut had higher contribution in blue wheat and Cy 3-glu had higher contribution in purple wheat. While the chromatographic pattern of donor and advanced lines of blue and black wheat lines was similar to each other, purple advanced line showed significantly different pattern than purple donor wheat line. It was also different from black and blue wheat lines. It indicates that background of plant plays significant role in expression of different anthocyanins. Quite different anthocyanins can express depending upon the donor and recipient cultivars used for the development of germplasm. Therefore, anthocyanin accumulation and thus chromatographic pattern may differ between different colored wheat lines being used by different research groups in different countries. In addition growing location and environmental conditions also affect anthocyanin accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>LPS treatment in macrophages causes NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. All these are biologically relevant and are reduced by antioxidants. High positive correlation was observed between TAC and NO assay, although correlation between TAC and pro-inflammatory cytokines was relatively less. There was insignificant correlation between SPC and pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Thus both biologically relevant PCL assay and cell line based assay indicated higher positive correlation with TAC than biologically non-relevant DPPH and ABTS assays. Cell line based studies are difficult and time consuming. On the other hand PCL assay is quick and highly sensitive. Thus PCL assay was best method for determination of antioxidant potential of colored wheat in comparison to white wheat. In addition to antioxidant potential, colored wheat lines had positive effect on cell viability. At higher doses, white wheat lines showed a substantial reduction in cell viability that was not observed in colored wheat lines. This might be due to high anthocyanin content in these lines that are exerting positive effect on cell viability.</p><p>Although purple wheat line had low TAC and PCL assay based antioxidant activity respect to blue and black lines, they exhibited higher inhibitory effects on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cell line based assays. This might be due to higher concentration of acylated anthocyanins in purple wheat [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with better stability and bioavailability [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Acylated anthocyanins are very low in concentration relative to non-acylated ones and are often overlooked.</p><p>We have developed colored wheat lines adapted to local climatic conditions. It is important to understand their potential for product making. Anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of the advanced wheat lines was either equal to or higher than donor lines. Especially in case of purple wheat lines with three time higher anthocyanin content than donor line.</p><p>Donor wheat lines were exotic lines with poor yield and agronomical traits compared to normal white wheat cultivars. Seeds were smaller with less flour extraction rate. As expected, donor wheat lines exhibited higher ash and dietary fibre content. Appropriate protein content is required for product-based utilization. Protein content of advanced lines was in range of recipient white line, indicating that developed colored lines have similar potential for product development as white wheat. The sugars, starch and dietary fibre constitute carbohydrates. Our advanced lines had satisfactory carbohydrate content. Higher sugar content in some colored wheat lines might pave the way for their better acceptability by the consumer. Vitamins and minerals are mainly located in the bran layers and germ [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Their higher content in donor lines was expected due to relatively poor yield, lower flour and starch content: so that the contribution of bran layers towards the total seed weight is higher. Phytic acid binds with essential metal ions and reduces their bioavailability [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Wheat lines with higher metal content are expected to have higher phytic acid content. Although this trend was observed in white wheat line, same was not true for colored lines, indicating that it will be possible to breed colored wheat lines with high yield, high metal ion content and low phytic acid content to add to their bioavailability. Blue and black colored wheat lines had better micronutrients than white wheat as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0194367.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It might be due to blue aleurone layer in these lines. Purple color is in the pericarp, and not in the aleurone. Aleurone layer is the only living part in wheat seed and is reservoir of micronutrients in wheat. Higher anthocyanin content and thus antioxidant content in aleurone layer might be associated with their better development and micronutrient accumulation. Iron and zinc are important micronutrients and their deficiency is prevalent in India. Several research groups are involved in improvement of iron and zinc content of wheat. Our colored wheat lines with high anthocyanin content also have high iron and zinc content and thus are double biofortified lines that are expected to have significant effect on human health. Further these lines possess all the features required for commercial product development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Biofortified crops have huge market potential.
