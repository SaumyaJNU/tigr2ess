Global demand of wheat has been increasing in the last few decades, with an average global energy supply increase from 441&#x02009;kcal capita<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> in 1963 to 552&#x02009;kcal capita<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>&#x02009;day<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> in 2013 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/zh/#data/FBS">http://www.fao.org/faostat/zh/#data/FBS</ext-link>). In China, wheat and its products account for 17.5% of the total daily intake of energy and 17.7% of protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/zh/#data/FBS">http://www.fao.org/faostat/zh/#data/FBS</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par40">Wheat flour has a distinctive nature for baking properties due to its unique gluten proteins as compared to other cereals. Gluten contains hundreds of different proteins that are either monomers (gliadins) or polymers (glutenins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The gliadins mainly form intramolecular disulfide bonds, which make them less important than glutenins for bread-baking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The glutenin polypeptides form large polymers via intermolecular disulfide bonds, which confer the dough elasticity (strength). Glutenin macropolymers (GMP) is one of the large type glutenin polymers insoluble in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which is closely correlated to the baking performances of wheat flour. After being separated in SDS-PAGE, GMP is further divided into the high molecular weight (HMW-) and low molecular weight (LMW-) subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, the formation of the above-mentioned storage proteins in wheat endosperm is crucial for the final bread-making quality.</p><p id="Par41">Limitations of protein deposition in wheat grain involve a balance between the capacity of substrate production in plant (source-limited), and utilization capacity of the substrate in grains (sink-limited) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Though some sink-related factors such as starch accumulation and grain size affect the biosynthesis of seed storage proteins, the source-limitation is reported to depress storage protein deposit in a large extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Namely, protein synthesis in grain is largely dependent on the supply of amino acid precursors being transported into the endosperm from the sources elsewhere in the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These precursors come from the hydrolysis of large protein molecules into amino acids by proteolytic enzymes in vegetative organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been shown that there is a parallel change in the content and composition of amino acids in the flag leaf, phloem exudate and the sap of the endosperm cavity and of the whole endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Barneix et al. (2007) reported that the final grain protein content (GPC) is correlated with the content of free amino acids in flag leaves during grain filling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It may therefore be possible to increase the amount of grain protein if more available amino acids are produced by protein hydrolysis in vegetative organs (such as green leaves) during the late grain filling stage.</p><p id="Par42">Wheat grain protein content is dependent on genetic, environmental and management factors as well as the interaction between these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is generally accepted that nitrogen (N) fertilization is the most effective management practice to regulate grain protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. N is usually split fertilized into doses of the basal N applied before sowing and the topdressing N applied during the growth period (mostly at the jointing stage, and sometimes further split at both jointing and booting stage) to produce both high grain yield and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. N topdressed at the early to mid-vegetative growth stages primarily increases yield potential rather than grain protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], whereas N applied during reproductive development stages enhances protein synthesis in grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For instance, splitting the use of N at booting or a later growth stage is found to enhance grain protein content and bread loaf volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. N application at spike formation stage increased gluten strength of cultivars with relatively short maturation period under a cool climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, Johansson et al. (2004) reported that late N application significantly decreased gluten strength rather than protein concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other studies have also shown that delaying N fertilization restricts the conversion of N into storage proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that describes regulatory effects of N topdressing timing on: production of amino acids by proteolysis in leaves, the consequent contribution to amino acids in the endosperm cavity sap, and the conversion of the amino acids for synthesis of storage protein in wheat endosperm.</p><p id="Par43">Therefore, based on a field experiment, we report the effects of N topdressed at different growth stages indicated by the leaf age on protein deposit in wheat grain. The time-course dynamic changes in the expression of genes involved in proteolysis in flag leaves during grain filling were investigated. Changes in contents of free amino acids in both the endosperm cavity sap and the developing endosperms during grain filling were followed. The conversion of amino acids in grains and its contribution to synthesis of storage proteins were also studied. The aims of the present study were (1) to clarify the relationship between proteolysis in vegetative organs and accumulation of amino acids in the endosperm cavity, conversion of amino acids and storage protein synthesis in endosperm of wheat grain; (2) to prove the regulatory effects of N topdressing timing on grain protein quality and (3) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par44">The experiment was conducted at the Tangquan Experimental Station of Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing (32&#x000b0;08&#x02032; N and 118&#x000b0;51&#x02032; E), Jiangsu Province, P.

Among environmental factors, nitrogen availability during wheat development is one of the most important parameters determining the gluten protein polymer structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, split application of N fertilizer in combination with delayed timing of application of N by topdressing is a very important agronomic practice both to achieve high grain yield and protein content and to realize economic and ecological production of wheat by reducing N fertilizer dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Here, in a field experiment the three topdressing N timing treatments were designed according to the leaf stage, i.e. N was applied at the emergence of the top 5th (TL5), 3rd (TL3) and 1st leaf (TL1) of the main stem, respectively. TL3 was regarded as the control since this stage is the jointing stage, which is the recommendation application stage for applying N topdressing. In agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], delaying N topdressing (TL1) increased the contents of protein, gliadin and glutenin (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Thus, the pre-anthesis accumulated N is crucial for accumulation of storage proteins in wheat grain, and to a large extent, determines the processing quality of wheat flour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. GS is known to play an important role in the assimilation of mineral N in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Here, the expression in flag leaves of the encoding gene <italic>GS2a</italic> substantially decreased during grain filling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), indicating declining protein synthesis in the flag leaf. However, delayed N topdressing (TL1) upregulated the expression of <italic>GS2a</italic> in flag leaves (compared with normal timing of topdressing application, TL3), while early N application (TL5) had the opposite effect. In summary these observations indicate that delaying the timing of N topdressing application improves both the uptake of N in the vegetative phase, but it also increases the physiological function of protein degradation and amino acid transport from leaves to grains during grain filling. Together with GS, asparagine synthetase (AS), which catalyses the formation of asparagine (Asn) and glutamate (Glu) from aspartate and glutamine (Gln), is believed to play a crucial role in primary N metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

The expression of <italic>ASN1</italic> was significantly higher in treatments with late topdressing (TL1) after 13DAA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

AlaAT catalyses the production of L-alanine (Ala) and 2-oxoglutarate from pyruvate and L-glutamate (Glu).

Therefore proteolysis of soluble proteins in leaves, which is catalyzed by various proteolytic enzymes, is essential for supply of amino acids for protein synthesis in grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Delaying N topdressing increased the content of total free amino acids in the endosperm at 7 DAA and 13 DAA, while there was no difference between topdressing timing treatments at 31 DAA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This observation is well in accordance with a previous report saying that at 7 and 14 DAA, the concentration of total free amino acids in grains was lower in plants with low N treatment that resulted in lower grain protein content in comparison to that of high N treatment. Still in those plants no differences were observed between free grain amino acid concentrations after 21 DAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This suggested that at early filling stages more free amino acids are utilized for synthesis of protein in grains in TL1 than in the other topdressing treatments.</p><p id="Par73">Amino acid composition is different between plant species; however, there is a consensus that Gln is the dominating amino acid of phloem sap (similar to endosperm cavity sap) in barley, wheat and spinach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For technical reasons we measured only the pool of Glu and Gln in this study. However, we confirmed that Glu and Gln were the most abundant amino acids in both cavity sap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and endosperm (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4&#x02013;2), reflecting the role of Gln as a major transported amino acid. After uptake from the endosperm cavity into endosperm, the content of Glu seems to decrease rapidly from 7 to 19 DAA in endosperm, while the content of Ser, Pro, Gly, Leu and Thr increases, suggesting that these amino acids are synthesized in the endosperm during this period, utilizing Glu delivered to the grain. This observation is in accordance with previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Since glutenin of mature grain mainly consist of Gln, Gly, Pro, Ser, Tyr, Leu and Ala, which constitute more than 75% of glutenins total amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], conversions between amino acids are crucial to provide appropriate substrate for glutenin synthesis. Levels of accumulation of different types of seed storage proteins have been reported to be influenced by differences in the interconversion between amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The expression of genes encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, arogenate dehydrogenase, phosphoserine aminotransferase, isopropyl malate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase, which catalyze the formation of Gly, Pro, Ser, Tyr, Leu and Ala, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], were studied here. Overall, the expression of these genes during the grain filling stage were higher in TL1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), indicating that the conversion of amino acids during grain filling is more active in TL1 than in the other two treatments. Such higher activity is likely to benefit the glutenin biosynthesis in grain.</p><p id="Par75">The expression of genes coding HMW-GS and LMW-GS was highest at 25 DAA for all three topdressing timings. Also, the differences between treatments were also most significant at this stage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This is in accordance with previous studies showing that the differences in content of HMW-GS due to different N application regimes in wheat starts to occur at 21 DAA and gradually becomes more prominent from 28 DAA to 35 DAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Formation of disulfide bonds, which is a prerequisite for correct folding of seed storage proteins is carried out by PDI-like proteins that are therefore important for gluten quality and content of GMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Here we found that the expression of <italic>PDIL2&#x02013;1</italic> was higher in TL1, in line with the observation that the content of GMP was increased by delaying N topdressing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par76">In summary, we have defined a schematic roadmap showing the coordinated regulation of N assimilation, source tissue protein proteolysis, amino acid transportation and metabolism as well as storage protein accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The results presented here suggest that there is a better coordination of N assimilation and leaf protein proteolysis when delaying N topdressing (TL1), which provides continuous N reserves for transportation to grains in the filling stage. While there were distinct differences in content of free amino acids in the endosperm cavity sap at 7 DAA, very little variation between topdressing treatments was observed at late grain filling stage, confirming N remobilization capacity was enhanced by TL1. Furthermore, the combined analysis of amino acids metabolism and glutenin synthesis in endosperm revealed an improved protein production in grain throughout development in grains from plants with delayed N topdressing. As an expected result of this, the contents of H/LMW-GS, GMP and glutenin were increased in TL1. The result provides a detailed understanding of the relationship between N remobilization, final grain protein content, gluten quality and timing of N topdressing in bread wheat.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation of N roadmap for grain gluten quality. Note: The main protein degradation is carry out in flag leaves, resulting in production of free amino acids that are transported from the leaf to the endosperm cavity sap, and subsequently used for protein synthesis in the wheat grain. This transportation flux is indicated with blue arrows. TL3 was used as standard. The bars indicate the relative levels of (TL1, red) and (TL5, blue) of: expression levels of relevant genes for amino acid metabolism, amino acid concentrations and protein content. TL5, TL3 and TL1 indicate topdressing timing of nitrogen in different wheat leaf fifth, third and first leaf (flag leaf) from the top, respectively. The average gene expression of selected genes in leaf (a-f) and endosperm (h-m, o-q) during grain filling stage was used to calculate the relative gene expression change in TL5 and TL1 in comparison to TL3. Total content of free amino acids in the cavity sap at 7 DAA were compared between treatments. The relative changes of average content of other free amino acids in endosperm during the grain filling stage in TL5 and TL1 are shown.
