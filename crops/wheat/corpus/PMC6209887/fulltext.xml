Introduction</title><p>Obesity, nowadays, is recognized as a worldwide epidemic being prevalent among adults as well as among adolescents and children [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Globally, obesity has shown a striking rise over the past four decades. Referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate data 2016, around 13.1% of the world&#x02019;s adult population aged 18 years and above were obese (11.1% of men and 15.1% of women). Regarding adolescents and children, 18% of the population aged between 5 and 19 years were overweight or obese in 2016. The WHO estimations for the same year showed that 31% of the Lebanese population aged 18 years and above were obese (27% of men and 35% of women). In Lebanon, obesity appeared to be prevalent in females more than males [<xref rid="B3-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Obesity is the most common nutrition-related disorder and a primary universal health concern associated with a high risk of metabolic and chronic diseases, mainly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, reproductive diseases and even some types of cancer [<xref rid="B4-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This global epidemic results from an interaction between genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors; however, it is well-known to be mediated by an imbalance between the energy intake and the energy expenditure. For years, there was an increasing interest in foods that regulate appetite, hence food intake, and improve metabolic regulation.</p><p>Pulses were a subject of concern, being among foods associated with a reduction in the risk of obesity [<xref rid="B5-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pulses are the non-oily edible seeds of legumes that are harvested only for their dry grains [<xref rid="B6-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These grain legumes represent good sources of nutrients and bioactive compounds [<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that modulate the physiological responses which facilitate obesity [<xref rid="B5-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Pulses are considered low glycemic index foods [<xref rid="B8-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] due to their high dietary fiber content [<xref rid="B6-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Their intake has been related to a reduced risk of chronic diseases [<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, growing efforts are being conducted to integrate pulse flours into composite flours. Composite flours are mixtures of flours made up by replacing entirely or partially wheat flour with flours from other cereals, pulses or tubers (root vegetables). These blends are mainly used either to enhance the nutritive value of food products or to encourage the use of locally grown crops.</p><p>Chickpea (<italic>Cicer arietinum</italic> L.) as a pulse flour receives attention nowadays because of its nutritional value [<xref rid="B10-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is a plentiful source of proteins and total amino acids, notably lysine. This property makes chickpea flour an excellent enhancer of protein quality when mixed with other cereal flours known to be low in lysine but rich in sulfur amino acids [<xref rid="B11-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Chickpea flour is considered to be a good source of fibers and fat, primarily monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), compared to wheat flour. It is reported to be an important source of minerals and vitamins, mainly vitamin B-complex. Also, it includes some bioactive phenolic compounds [<xref rid="B12-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Flour from chickpea was among the most predominant studied pulse flours in different types of food: bread [<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], spaghetti [<xref rid="B14-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], cakes [<xref rid="B15-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], biscuits and cookies [<xref rid="B16-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The growing body of research on the health benefits of chickpea flour has increased. Clinical trials investigating the hypoglycemic properties of chickpea flour generated valuable data. A reduction in the glycemic response was observed when adding raw chickpea flour to whole-wheat flour in bread [<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the reduction was modest when extruded chickpea flour was added to white flour in bread [<xref rid="B18-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The effect of chickpea flour on postprandial insulin and subjective appetite has not been confirmed yet. Earlier studies used either chickpea flour made from raw ground grains [<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or extruded flour [<xref rid="B18-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, chickpea flour made by other cooking methods was not previously used in such clinical trials.</p><p>Chickpeas are available grains in Lebanon, used in several traditional dishes as whole or mashed boiled grains but not as a flour. Boiling is known to enhance the flavor of pulses [<xref rid="B19-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and increase the availability of healthy nutrients [<xref rid="B20-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and fiber content [<xref rid="B21-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, chickpea flour made by means of boiling grains may be a valuable functional ingredient of traditional Lebanese pastries and baked products. At present, the metabolic properties of pre-processed chickpea flour and its impact on appetite-related hormones have not been previously evaluated.</p><p>Thus, this study was designed to incorporate pre-processed chickpea flour made by soaking, boiling and drying grains into a popular Lebanese pastry &#x0201c;<italic>Mankoushe Zaatar</italic>&#x0201d;, to investigate the impact of this incorporation on postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and lipidemia, and to determine its capacity in modulating the gastrointestinal hormones involved in appetite control, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin, in healthy Lebanese females.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-foods-07-00173"><title>2.

Test Meals</title><p>&#x0201c;<italic>Mankoushe</italic>&#x0201d;, is a widely consumed Lebanese pastry similar to pizza, in which a refined wheat flour dough-base is topped with mixed herbs, known as &#x0201c;<italic>Zaatar</italic>&#x0201d;.</p><p>Refined wheat flour (Crown Flour Mills, Beirut, Lebanon) and pre-processed chickpea flour were used. Chickpea grains were soaked in distilled water in the ratio of 1:10 (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) for 17 h; water was discarded and fresh tap water was added to the chickpeas in the ratio of 1:10 (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>). Grains were boiled at 100 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, drained, then dried in an industrial air drier (Tecmon s.r.l; Cassina De&#x02019; Pecchi MI, Italy) for 8 h at a temperature of 38&#x02013;40 &#x000b0;C. Dried grains were ground into powder form with an electrical multifunction swing type portable grinder (TIMEMORE, Shanghai, China), and sifted through a 60-mesh stainless-steel sieve.</p><p>Two types of meal were prepared: &#x0201c;<italic>Regular Mankoushe</italic>&#x0201d; (RM) having the dough made up with 100% refined wheat flour and &#x0201c;<italic>Chickpea Mankoushe</italic>&#x0201d; (CM) having the dough made up with a mixture refined wheat/pre-processed chickpea flour (70/30). The wheat replacement rate was based on the amount of pre-processed chickpea flour that could be added and still produce a CM with similar organoleptic properties to RM. Based on a sensory test previous to the study (unpublished data, 2017), a higher incorporation rate of chickpea flour appeared to alter the organoleptic qualities of the end-product.</p><p>Doughs were prepared under controlled conditions, and 160 g dough was used for the two test meals. The topping &#x0201c;<italic>Zaatar</italic>&#x0201d; was a mixture of ground oregano, sesame seeds, sumac spices and salt in the following percentages: 35.86%, 43.04%, 17.93%, and 3.15%. Afterward, sunflower oil was added to &#x0201c;<italic>Zaatar</italic>&#x0201d;. The topping mixture was based on the following percentages: 31.70% &#x0201c;<italic>Zaatar</italic>&#x0201d; and 68.30% oil. Doughs were flattened, portioned, topped with the herbs and oil mixture, and baked for 6 min at 300 &#x000b0;C. Mean caloric content of meals is 680.99 &#x000b1; 2.46 kcal/meal.

Experimental Protocol</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the DSST, Lebanese University. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height) of fasted consented subjects were taken, and body mass index (BMI), lean body mass (LBM) and percentage body fat (% BF) were determined using the bio-impedance body composition analyzer (GAIA 359 PLUS). The study used a randomized blind cross-over design in which each subject served as her own control. Subjects were tested in the follicular phase and were randomly given two iso-energetic breakfasts (<italic>Regular Mankoushe</italic> (RM), <italic>Chickpeas Mankoushe</italic> (CM)) on two separate days, three days apart. Overnight fasted subjects attended the research center in the morning, were comfortably seated, and a catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein for blood draws. Baseline blood was drawn 15 min before breakfast consumption. Test meals were served allowing 10 min for subjects to finish their breakfast. During the experiment, food and beverages were prohibited, and subjects were not allowed to talk about food, appetite, satiety, and fullness. They were allowed only to use the toilet or to have light entertainments. At 230 min following breakfast, subjects were asked to consume a standardized ad libitum lunch: a pizza meal (525 g; 999.46 kcal). Calorie content of the pizza was determined based on the USDA database [<xref rid="B22-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

However, substituting 25 and 35% of whole wheat flour for raw chickpea flour was reported to reduce the glycemic response when compared to white bread [<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and no comparison was made with whole wheat bread. It remains to be understood whether the type of chickpea and its processing, which is known to increase starch digestibility [<xref rid="B30-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and reduce the content of anti-nutrient substances&#x02014;tannins, phytic acid, and saponins [<xref rid="B31-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], have impacted the glycemic response. The modest reduction in glucose and insulin level of the CM meal may relate to carbohydrate content (e.g., amylose) of the meal [<xref rid="B32-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as well as to their high capacity for retrogradation and production of resistant starch [<xref rid="B33-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, the mean changes in TG from baseline were significantly lower at 30 min (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008), comparable at 90 min and higher at 150 and 210 min following CM compared to RM, and the difference was significant at 150 min (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009). Incremental areas under the curve for TG changes from baseline calculated over 210 min showed similar values for both breakfasts. The two-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed a significant main effect of time (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) but not a main meal effect or time x meal interaction on serum TG changes from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00173-f002">Figure 2</xref>c).</p><p>Pulse rich diets have received attention as many researchers suggest that long-term pulse consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in humans [<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B34-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the acute effect of pulse intake on lipid profile has not been extensively studied. Recently, it has been postulated that elevated non-fasting TGs taken randomly are a risk factor for CVD and other chronic diseases [<xref rid="B35-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the current study, postprandial TG was minimally (~30 mg/dL) manipulated, and IAUC were similar between the meals.

Our results show that the TG levels (RM (70.16 mg/dL) and CM (87.09 mg/dL) at time 150 min (peak time)) were below 180 mg/dL, which is considered the desirable non-fasting TG level [<xref rid="B35-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-foods-07-00173"><title>3.2.

To our knowledge, no previous studies were reported earlier regarding the acute impact of chickpea or pulses as flours or as grains on GLP-1 or ghrelin. Other authors studied the impact of different kinds of bread on gastrointestinal hormones, and they have found no differential effect of white breads or wholemeal bread on both peptides (GLP-1 and ghrelin).

However, this was not observed in the current study with chickpea flour.

Throughout the experiment, perceptions of hunger and prospective food consumption (PFC) increased, and perceptions of fullness and satiety decreased gradually following the two breakfasts. Within the two breakfasts, the mean values for the four perceptions, Hunger, Fullness, Satiety, and PFC, were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00173-f004">Figure 4</xref>).

The difference between chickpea as boiled grains and as flour could be attributed to the particles size. It has been reported that fine flour provides a low satiety response compared to coarse flour [<xref rid="B43-foods-07-00173" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, further investigations regarding the satiating effect of chickpea flour are necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-foods-07-00173"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, incorporating pre-processed chickpea flour as 30% into &#x0201c;<italic>Mankoushe&#x0201d;</italic> was found to have a modest reduction in postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. However, it was not found to alter TG level, appetite scores, and subsequent food intake. The treated chickpea flour appeared to differently affect the gut peptides, GLP-1 and ghrelin. Chickpea flour may offer a promising functional ingredient to enhance the nutritional quality of traditional products. Nevertheless, more investigations are warranted regarding the incorporation rate, the processing method, and other appetite-related hormones. Mechanisms mediating gut-peptide regulation are still unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could provide new promising strategies to combat obesity and other metabolic disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Acknowledgments are dedicated to all participants in the clinical trials.
