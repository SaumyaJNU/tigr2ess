    "BACKGROUND:Internal γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) interacting with stress response substances may be involved in the regulation of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) associated with optimum temperature and cold stress in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze). RESULTS:Tea plants supplied with or without 5.0 mM GABA were subjected to optimum or cold temperatures in this study. The increased GABA level induced by exogenous GABA altered levels of stress response substances - such as glutamate, polyamines and anthocyanins - in association with improved cold tolerance. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) - based DAPs were found for protein metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, energy, amino acid transport and metabolism other biological processes, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, antioxidant and stress defense. CONCLUSIONS:The iTRAQ analysis could explain the GABA-induced physiological effects associated with cold tolerance in tea plants. Analysis of functional protein-protein networks further showed that alteration of endogenous GABA and stress response substances induced interactions among photosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and the corresponding differences could contribute to improved cold tolerance of tea plants."
