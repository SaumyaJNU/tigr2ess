    "This study was designed to compare the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of raw and paste wheat flour. The raw flour was cooked, dried, and milled to obtain the paste flour. The glycemic index, starch, amylose, and amylopectin contents were determined. The inhibitory effects of the raw and paste flour on α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities as well as metal-induced pancreatic damage were also determined. Pasting reduced the glycemic index (63.15%), starch (22.83 g/100 g), amylose (2.88 g/100 g), and amylopectin (17.74 g/100 g) contents. The raw (IC 50 = 0.50 and 1.20 mg/ml) and paste (IC 50 = 0.29 and 1.66 mg/ml) flours reduced the activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively. The paste flour exhibited stronger inhibitory effects against Fe2+-induced pancreatic damage compared to raw flour. The paste flour exhibited better antioxidant and antidiabetic properties and could be a good processing method to improve the medicinal properties of wheat flour."
