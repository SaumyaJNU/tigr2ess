    "Chemical insecticides are widely used for pest control worldwide. However, the impact of insecticides on indirect plant defense is seldom reported. Here, using tea plants and the pesticide imidacloprid, effects of chemical insecticides on C6-green leaf volatiles (GLVs) anabolism and release were investigated first time. Compared with the non-treated control plants, the treatment of imidacloprid resulted in the lower release amount of key GLVs: (Z)-3-hexenal, n-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexene-1-ol and (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate. The qPCR analysis revealed a slight higher transcript level of the CsLOX3 gene but a significantly lower transcript level of CsHPL gene. Our results suggest that imidacloprid treatment can have a negative effect on the emission of GLVs due to suppressing the critical GLVs synthesis-related gene, consequently affecting plant indirect defense."
