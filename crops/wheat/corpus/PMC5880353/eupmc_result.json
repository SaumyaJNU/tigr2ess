    "Leaf blotch of wheat caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana is a major constraint to wheat production, causing significant yield reduction resulting in severe economic impact. The present study characterizes to determine and compare pathogenic variability exist/not based on components of leaf blotch disease development and level of aggressiveness due to agroclimatic condition of B. sorokiniana in wheat. A total of 169 virulent isolates of B. sorokiniana isolated from spot blotch infected leaf from different wheat growing agroclimate of Bangladesh. Pathogenic variability was investigated on a susceptible wheat variety 'kanchan' now in Bangladesh. A clear evidence of positive relationship among the components was recorded. From hierarchical cluster analysis five groups were originating among the isolates. It resolved that a large amount of pathogenic diversity exists in Bipolaris sorokiniana. Variation in aggressiveness was found among the isolates from different wheat growing areas. Most virulent isolates BS 24 and BS 33 belonging to High Ganges River Flood Plain agro-climatic zones considered by rice-wheat cropping pattern, hot and humid weather, high land and low organic matter content in soil. Positive relationship was found between pathogenic variability and aggressiveness with agro-climatic condition."
