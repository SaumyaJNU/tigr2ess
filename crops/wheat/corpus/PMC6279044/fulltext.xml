In this paper, a 28.5 hm<sup>2</sup> winter wheat field under the traditional cultivation model in Tianzhuang town of Huantai County was selected as the research area. The mesh point method was utilized for sampling (60&#x000d7;60 m), and the characteristics of soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) variations in the before sowing, reviving, jointing, and filling stages of winter wheat were analyzed using geostatistical and GIS methods. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the response of wheat growth and development to soil nutrient variations. As the growth stages progressed, 1) each nutrient showed the characteristics of low-high-low and moderate variability. The highest AN and AK contents were found at the reviving stage, while AP reached a turning point at the jointing stage. The order of variability of each nutrient was AN&#x0003e;AP&#x0003e;AK. 2) The nutrient variations first increased and then decreased and showed medium to strong spatial correlation. The three nutrients were strongly spatially correlated in the before sowing stage and moderately spatially correlated during the reviving stage. During the jointing and filling stages, AN had moderate spatial correlation, and AP and AK had strong spatial correlation. The spatial correlation of each nutrient was the weakest in the reviving stage, and the spatial correlation of AN was strongest in the before sowing stage, while the spatial correlations of AP and AK were strongest in the jointing stage. The spatial correlation of each soil nutrient decreased from the before sowing stage to the reviving stage and from the jointing stage to the filling stage, and the spatial correlation increased from the reviving stage to the jointing stage. 3) The soil nutrient content first increased and then decreased, and the grades of the nutrients gradually decreased. 4) The correlation between soil nutrients and wheat growth gradually increased. AN had the highest correlation with wheat growth, followed by AK and AP. The effect of soil nutrients on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage was greater than the effect of nutrients in the current stage. The growth of wheat at the jointing stage was mainly influenced by nutrients in the current stage, while the growth of wheat at the filling stage was influenced by the nutrient contents of both the previous and current stages. Thus, the date of fertilizer supplementation should be postponed properly. In this study, the soil nutrient dynamics and their influence on the growth of wheat during the winter wheat growth period under the traditional field model were well described, and these results could provide a theoretical basis for the precision management of soil nutrients in the northern winter wheat area where the planting environment and cultivation management are relatively uniform.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the twelfth Five-Year National Science and Technology Support Plan</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015BAD23B0202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Gengxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>the funds of Shandong &#x0201d;Double Tops&#x0201d; program</institution></funding-source><award-id>SYL2017XTTD02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Gengxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported jointly by the twelfth Five-Year National Science and Technology Support Plan (No.2015BAD23B0202), and the funds of Shandong &#x0201d;Double Tops&#x0201d; program (SYL2017XTTD02.

For example, Duraisamy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied the spatial heterogeneity of soil pH, organic carbon and available nutrients in the typical dry areas of India. Rosemary et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studied the spatial structure of topsoil at multiple scales and land use intensities. Paz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] explained that soil nutrients and trace elements exhibited spatial dependence even in very small areas (approximately 1.8 hectares). Yang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared the scale effects of soil available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) on spatial variability under different sampling scales. Blanchet et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] analyzed the effects of different land use patterns, soil types, topographies and other factors on the spatial variability of soil K. However, in general, most studies have focused on the spatial variability of soil nutrients, with less consideration of the temporal variability and their effects on crop growth. Thus, the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients in different crop growth stages remains unclear [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Santillano-C&#x000e1;zares et al.

[<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] studied the characteristics of the temporal and spatial variations in soil in wheat fields that used drip irrigation for different numbers of years. However, these studies are still limited to the analysis of soil nutrients themselves, and the research on soil nutrient variability combined with crop development is still very scarce. Plant growth depends on the absorption of soil nutrients, so soil nutrient variability should also cause spatiotemporal variability in plant growth status [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The study area is located in the Huanghuai winter wheat region, which is the most important wheat-producing area in China. The region was classified as having a continental monsoon climate in a warm temperate zone. The climate is mild, and the four seasons are distinct. The average annual air temperature is 12.5&#x000b0;C, and the frost-free period lasts 197 days. The annual average precipitation is 587 mm, which mainly falls in 6~9 months. The terrain is flat with an elevation of 5.7 to 6.8 m a.s.l. The main soil types are cinnamon soil (typic udivitrands), and the winter wheat variety is Jimai 17. The entire process followed the traditional cultivation management mode of the farmers.

AN was divided into 3 categories and 6 grades: high: I, &#x0003e;150 mg/kg, II, 120&#x02013;150 mg/kg; medium: III, 90&#x02013;120 mg/kg, IV, 60&#x02013;90 mg/kg; low: V, 30&#x02013;60 mg/kg, VI, &#x0003c;30 mg/kg. AP was divided into 3 categories and 7 grades: high: I, &#x0003e;100 mg/kg, II, 60&#x02013;100 mg/kg; medium: III, 40&#x02013;60 mg/kg, IV, 20&#x02013;40 mg/kg, V, 10&#x02013;20 mg/kg; low: VI, 5&#x02013;10 mg/kg, VII, &#x0003c;5 mg/kg. AK was divided into 3 categories and 7 grades: high: I, &#x0003e;400 mg/kg, II, 350&#x02013;400 mg/kg; medium: III, 300&#x02013;350 mg/kg, IV, 250&#x02013;300 mg/kg, V, 200&#x02013;250 mg/kg; low: VI, 150&#x02013;200 mg/kg, VII, &#x0003c;150 mg/kg. Based on the interpolated nutrient map, the professional viewpoints of landscape ecology were referenced, including 2 landscape level indices: patch number (NP) and patch density (PD) and 1 type level index: the percentage of landscape area (PLAND). A total of 3 indices were selected to quantitatively analyze the spatial dynamic characteristics of soil nutrient variation.</p><p>The values of SPAD and LAI at different growth stage of wheat and the soil AN, AP, and AK were compared at each point.

There was no significant difference in AN content between the before sowing stage and reviving stages, the jointing and filling stages, but the AN content in the before sowing and reviving stages was significantly higher than that during the jointing and filling stages. The AP content ranged from 35.70 to 64.37 mg/kg, and the CV ranged from 34.56% to 59.14% from the before sowing stage to the filling stage. The AP content was low before sowing and was significantly different from that in the other three growth stages. At the reviving stage, the AP content increased significantly and increased slightly at the jointing stage and then decreased slightly at the filling stage. The CV for AP content was moderate in each growth stage, but the CV before sowing appeared higher, followed by jointing stage, and the lowest values occurred at the reviving stage and filling stage.

The characteristics of the soil nutrient variations were greatest at the jointing stage, and the difference first increased and then decreased. The R<sup>2</sup> of the best-fitting model for each nutrient ranged from 0.904 to 0.997, and the root mean square standardized error (RMSSE) ranged from 3.36&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 6.93&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, which indicated that the selected model of the semivariogram was optimal and could adequately reflect the characteristics of the spatial structure and variation trends of soil nutrients throughout the growth period.</p><p>The C<sub>0</sub> values of AN, AP and AK in the four growth stages were all close to 0, indicating that the variation caused by the test and sampling errors was very small. The C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C) of AN was 10.29% before sowing with strong spatial correlation, and it ranged from 27.09% to 38.67% from the reviving stage to the filling stage, with moderate spatial correlation. The C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C) values of AP at the before sowing, jointing and filling stages were 8.65%, 8.35% and 15.89%, respectively, with strong spatial correlation, and this value was 34.35% at the reviving stage with moderate spatial correlation. The C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C) values of AK at the before sowing, jointing and filling stages were 12.5%, 10.77 and 13.82%, respectively, with strong spatially correlated, and this value was 26.09% at the reviving stage with moderate spatial correlation. Overall, the three nutrients showed moderate to strong spatial correlation with the progression of the growth stages and experienced a process of weakening-strengthening-weakening. These three nutrients were strongly spatially correlated before sowing, and the spatial correlation was moderate during the reviving stage. For the jointing and filling stages, AN exhibited moderate spatial correlation, and AP and AK were strongly spatially correlated. These three nutrients exhibited the weakest spatial correlation at the reviving stage, the spatial correlation of AN was strongest in the before sowing stage, while the spatial correlations of AP and AK were the strongest at the jointing stage.</p><p>The fractal dimensions of the three nutrients were from 1.817&#x02013;1.897, 1.887&#x02013;1.925, 1.853&#x02013;1.900 and 1.890&#x02013;1.941 from the before sowing stage to the filling stage, indicating that the soil nutrients in each growth stage had good fractal characteristics and structure. The fractal dimension values showed a process of first increasing then decreasing and then increasing from the before sowing stage. This result indicated that the structure of the soil nutrients became more complex, and the spatial correlation was weakened from the before sowing stage to the reviving stage and from the jointing stage to the filling stage, while the structure of nutrients tended to be consistent, and the spatial correlation increased from the reviving stage to the jointing stage.</p><p>The Z values of AN, AP and AK in the four growth stages were all &#x0003e;1.96, indicated that the null hypothesis of spatial randomness could be rejected and the spatial distribution was a significant aggregation pattern. The spatial autocorrelation are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203509.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. Moran&#x02019;s I of the three nutrients ranged from 0.226&#x02013;0.320, 0.153&#x02013;0.282, 0.212&#x02013;0.280 and 0.125&#x02013;0.270 from the before sowing stage to the filling stage. The value of Moran&#x02019;s I showed a process of first decreasing then increasing and then decreasing from the before sowing stage. The results showed that the soil nutrient structure gradually dispersed, and the spatial correlation decreased from the before sowing stage to the reviving stage and from the jointing stage to the filling stage. The structure of the nutrients tended to gather, and the spatial correlation increased from the reviving stage to the filling stage.</p><p>In general, as the growth progressed, (1) each nutrient showed moderate to strong spatial correlation. (2) The three nutrients exhibited strong spatial correlation during the before sowing stage and moderate spatial correlation during the reviving stage. For the jointing and filling stages, AN exhibited a moderate spatial correlation, and AP and AK exhibited strong spatial correlation. (3) The weakest spatial correlation of the three nutrients was shown at the reviving stage; the strongest spatial correlation of AN was shown before sowing, while the AP and AK exhibited the strongest spatial correlation at the jointing stage. (4) The spatial correlation of soil nutrients decreased from before sowing to the reviving stage, jointing stage and filling stage, and increased from the reviving stage to the jointing stage.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>The spatial distribution characteristics of soil nutrients in different growth stages of winter wheat</title><p>The spatial and temporal distribution maps of soil nutrients in the different growth stages of winter wheat are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203509.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The distribution of AN before sowing showed a striped pattern, and the content from northwest to southeast was obviously higher than that in other regions. For the reviving stage, the concentration of AN declined slightly, and the content in the study area was opposite to that before sowing. The areas with high AN contents were concentrated in the northeast to southwest areas. For the jointing stage, AN showed a clustered distribution, and the AN content was significantly decreased, mainly concentrated from 60~90 mg/kg. For the filling stage, the continuity of the distribution continued to increase, and the AN content continued to decline, reaching a value lower than 60 mg/kg. The distribution of AP before sowing was dispersed, and there were no clear centers of high and low contents. For the reviving stage, the distribution of AP showed a striped pattern, and the AP content increased significantly at this stage. For the jointing stage, the boundaries of the high and low regions were obvious, the overall trend was high in the east and low in the west, and the AP content was high throughout the study area, mainly concentrated at &#x0003e; 60 mg/kg. For the filling stage, AP showed a clustered distribution, and the area with high nutrient contents decreased. The distribution of AK before sowing showed a clustered distribution, and the high content area was concentrated in the northeast. For the reviving stage, the distribution of AK showed a striped pattern, and the area with high contents increased. For the jointing stage, the continuity of the AK distribution decreased significantly, and the area with high contents decreased rapidly. For the filling stage, the distribution characteristics of AK were similar to those at the jointing stage; the AK content decreased further, and the area with low contents increased.</p><fig id="pone.0203509.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0203509.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of soil nutrients during the different growth stages of winter wheat.</title><p>Note: AN: available N; AP: available P; AK: available K.

The distribution of AN was consistent at the landscape level during the different stages. Patch number and PD showed the characteristics of increased-decreased-decreased. From before sowing to the filling stage, the proportions of the areas that showed high grades (I and II) were 20.39%, 28.32%, 0%, and 0%, the proportions of the areas that showed middle graded (III and IV) were 55.79%, 50.56%, 49.33%, and 27.6%, and the proportions of the areas that showed low graded (V and VI) were 23.82%, 21.11%, 50.66%, and 72.4%. This result showed that with the progression of the growth stages, the proportions of the area with high and low levels of AN exhibited an opposite trend, and the proportion of the area with high AN content gradually decreased after the reviving stage, while the proportion of the area with low grades increased. The distribution of AP was consistent at the landscape level during the different stages. Patch number and PD showed decreased-decreased-increased characteristics. From before sowing to the filling stage, the proportions of the area with high grades (I and II) were 10.18%, 55.23%, 67.81%, and 48.77%, the proportions of the area with middle grades (III, IV, V) were 88.28%, 44.77%, 32.17%, and 51.23%, and the proportions of the areas with low grades (VI and VII) were 1.53%, 0%, 0%, and 0%. This result showed that the dominant areas were converted from high contents to moderate contents. The distribution of AK was consistent at the landscape level during the different stages and showed a characteristic of continuous increase. From before sowing to the filling stage, the proportions of the area with high grades (I and II) were 18.13%, 55.59%, 6.38%, and 6.34%, the proportions of the area with middle grades (III, IV, V) were 76.4%, 44.41%, 93.62%, and 92.56%, and the proportions of the area with low grades (VI and VII) were 5.46%, 0%, 0%, and 1.1%. This result showed that with the progression of the growth stages, the AK at the type level exhibited changes that were similar to the changes in AN in general, and the proportion of the area with high grades decreased after the reviving stage.

This result indicated that the nutrients before sowing had a more obvious effect on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage than the nutrients at the reviving stage. The correlation coefficients between AN, AP and AK (reviving stage) and the SPAD and LAI values (jointing stage) were significantly lower than the correlation coefficients between AN, AP and AK (jointing stage) and the SPAD and LAI values (jointing stage). This result indicated that the growth of wheat at the jointing stage was mainly affected by the nutrients of the current stage, which was related to the jointing stage being a peak period of nutrient uptake by wheat. This finding was mainly related to the reason that the jointing stage is a peak period of soil nutrient absorption by wheat. The correlation coefficients between AN, AP and AK (jointing stage) and the SPAD and LAI values (filling stage) were significantly lower than the correlation coefficients between AN, AP and AK (filling stage) and the SPAD and LAI values (filling stage), but it still reached significant correlation. This result indicated that the growth of wheat at the filling stage was affected by the soil nutrients at both the jointing stage and filling stage.</p><p>In general, the growth status of wheat was closely related to the nutrients in the soil.

At the reviving stage, the effect of nutrients before sowing on the growth of wheat was slightly higher than the effect of nutrients in the reviving stage. At the jointing stage, the effect of nutrients in the jointing stage on the growth of wheat was much higher than the effect of nutrients in the reviving stage. At the filling stage, the status of wheat growth was affected by the nutrients in the jointing stage and filling stage.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>(1) Many experimental design methods have the advantages of easy access to data, low cost and small interference, but these conditions are different from the real field environment and management mode, and the conclusions of these studies have great limitations in the application of agricultural extension. Based on this, this research studied the soil nutrients and winter wheat under the traditional tillage model, and the conclusions were more practical and could be more suitable for winter wheat planting areas in northern China.</p><p>(2) Huantai County is located in the Huanghuai winter wheat area, which is the main wheat production area of China where the planting conditions are superior. It was representative to study the variation in soil nutrients and their correlation with crop growth during the winter wheat growth period. The minimum spatial correlation distance of soil nutrients in each growth stage was 88.2 m, which exceeded the sampling interval (60 m) and indicated that the sampling interval was reasonable. In this study, the dynamic changes in soil nutrient content during the winter wheat growth period were generally consistent with the results of research conducted in Jiangyan City, Jiangsu Province, China [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>(3) Soil nutrients showed moderate variations during the growth stage of winter wheat, generally showing that the concentrations of AN were slightly higher than those of AP but much larger than those of AK. The reason for this difference was mainly related to fertilization. The high variability of AN was due to the large demand for nitrogen by wheat, and farmers pay great attention to the use of urea. The high variability of AP was related to the chemical behavior of P elements in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The mobility of AP was weak, and its utilization rate was low, resulting in a large amount of fertilizer residue in the soil and uneven distribution, which was also confirmed by the maximum variation in AP before sowing in this research. The soil parent material in the study area was rich in potassium and was in excess of that required for the growth of wheat. Therefore, the influence of field management on AK was small, so the variability was low.</p><p>(4) Single C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C) values were not stable or effective in describing the structure of the variation when the C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C) values were large in a small area [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, a method of mutual verification of C<sub>0</sub>/ (C<sub>0</sub>+C), fractal dimension and Moran&#x02019;s I was adopted in this research. The results showed that the structure of soil nutrients weakened from before sowing to the reviving stage and from the jointing stage to the filling stage and tended to strengthen from the reviving stage to the jointing stage. This pattern may be caused by field management and nutrient absorption during wheat growth. In particular, urea supplementation at the reviving stage and irrigation at the filling stage were the main reasons for the obvious decreases in soil nutrient correlation. The nutrient uptake of winter wheat peaked at the jointing stage, and the soil nutrient distribution tended to be balanced and then structurally enhanced. Significant changes in soil nutrient correlation were also found during the growth period of tobacco [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world; thus, systematically studying the effects of wheat growth on soil nutrients was of great significance. However, the results in this field still need to be enriched.</p><p>(5) The correlation coefficients between AN and SPAD and LAI values were the highest at all growth stages of winter wheat, followed by those for AK and AP. This result may be related to the differences in the demands for different nutrients during the growth stage of winter wheat. The ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium absorption in wheat was 3.1:1:3.14 in the brown soil area of western Henan Province, China [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which has planting conditions similar to those in this research area. This finding was basically consistent with the conclusions of this study. The correlation between the soil nutrients and the growth index of the following growth stage showed that the growth of the winter wheat in the reviving stage was mainly influenced by the soil nutrients in the previous stage (before sowing), indicating that there was a temporal delay from fertilization to the impacts of fertilizer on crop growth. The effects of soil nutrients at the jointing stage on the growth of wheat at the jointing stage were much higher than the effects of soil nutrients in the jointing stage. This result was related to the high demands for fertilizer at the jointing stage of wheat [<xref rid="pone.0203509.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, ensuring the supply of fertilizer at the jointing stage is of great significance. At the filling stage, the effect of nutrients in the previous stage (jointing stage) on the growth of winter wheat was obvious. Because the traditional period of urea supplementation is generally during the reviving stage in northern China, in view of the importance of the jointing stage to the growth of winter wheat, the time of fertilizer supplementation should be properly moved to the jointing stage to ensure the nutrient supply in the later stage of wheat growth. The spatial and temporal distributions of more biological indicators of winter wheat need to be further studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>(1) The contents of three nutrients all showed the characteristics of decreased-increased-decreased and moderate variability.

At the filling stage, the status of wheat growth was affected by the nutrients in both the jointing stage and filling stage.</p><p>The temporal and spatial characteristics of the soil nutrient variations and the response of wheat growth throughout the winter wheat growth period under the traditional tillage model were clearly described, which could provide a scientific basis for the effective guidance for wheat production and the popularization of precision fertilization technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203509.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Semivariogram theoretical models of soil nutrients in different growth stages of winter wheat.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203509.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203509.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Spatial autocorrelation of soil nutrients in different growth stages of winter wheat.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203509.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the agriculturist at the Agricultural Bureau of Huantai County for their help with the field work.
