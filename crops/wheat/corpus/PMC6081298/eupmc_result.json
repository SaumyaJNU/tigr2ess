    "Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) remains a long-standing problem for the production of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Grain dormancy, a key trait for the prevention of PHS, controls the timing of germination. Discovery of the causal sequence polymorphisms (CSPs) that produce naturally occurring variation in dormancy will help improve PHS tolerance. The identification of CSPs for dormancy remains difficult, especially for barley and wheat, because they are the last major cereals to have their genomes sequenced. However, recent work has identified several important CSPs that play pivotal roles in fine-tuning the dormancy levels in barley and wheat cultivars. This review summarizes these recent advances, which can be directly applied in breeding programs to improve PHS tolerance. These recent findings indicate the possibility that barley and wheat cultivars grown in East Asia, where much rain falls during the harvest season, will be rich sources of alleles that confer strong dormancy, since these cultivars have been selected to cope with the regional climate. The newly discovered dormant alleles will be useful for improving PHS tolerance around the world, just as Reduced-height (Rht) alleles from Japanese wheat varieties contributed to yield increases for the Green Revolution."
