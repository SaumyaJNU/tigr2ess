Diagnosis of food allergy in Asia is usually made after family complaints or by elimination and/or reintroduction foods. This could lead to an inaccurate diagnosis and to incorrect information on epidemiology of food allergy.

Food allergy in Asia is less commonly observed than among Western countries [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With the advent of the social media, parents have become increasing concerned of food allergy and the information on food allergy is widely shared over the Internet. As a result, a large number of children were perceived to have food allergy based on history alone.</p><p>In the Thai society, children with suspicion of having food allergy are commonly subjected to diet elimination from all foods potentially causing allergic reactions (&#x02018;big 6&#x02019; or &#x02018;big 8&#x02019; foods, i.e., cow milk, egg, wheat, peanut/tree nuts, soy, and seafoods-fish/shellfishes) without a proper medical evaluation. Such practice can cause undue stress to the families (frustration, apprehension) and difficulties in acquiring food substitutes. Moreover, these children are prone to develop nutritional deficiencies due to extensive food avoidance. There is an absolute need for conducting a proper diagnostic evaluation for food allergy to ensure that avoidance is limited to only those with true allergy to foods.</p><p>Oral food challenge (OFC), particularly double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is the gold standard for the confirmation of food allergy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among those children presented with parental complaints of food allergy, positive OFC could only be confirmed in 30% or less [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Despite such findings, OFC is infrequently performed in allergy practices due to inadequate procedural set up, risk for side effects and reluctance of physicians to carry out this effort-dependent procedure in busy daily practices [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Asia, aside from China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore, reports of OFC results are limited [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such scarcity of information has led to uncertainty of epidemiology of food allergy from this part of World such as types of foods commonly causing reactions, severity of the reactions and of efficacy/safety of the OFC procedure. In this report, we present our 16-year experience of OFC at the Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital in Thailand and with the longest establishment of allergy services in this Thailand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A retrospective chart review of 228 children scheduled for OFC at the Allergy clinic of Pediatric Department, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University between 1996&#x02013;2012 was conducted. Indication for OFC among these patients were major complaints of food allergy requiring confirmation (n = 210), chronic urticaria (n = 8), unknown recurrent anaphylaxis (n = 1), severe atopic dermatitis (n = 6), chronic vomiting from unknown cause (n = 1), and recurrent pneumonia from unknown cause (n = 2). Nineteen patients were excluded from the analysis due to incomplete chart data (n = 19), refusal for challenge (n = 1), and not showing up for OFC (n = 2). Data from 206 children and from a total of 306 challenges were analyzed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> for flow chart of inclusion and exclusion of recruited subjects).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Large?><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study details indicating inclusion and exclusion of participants.

Positive skin testings were defined as those with wheal diameter of 3 mm greater than negative control. Serum food-specific IgE were measured using ImmunoCap system (Thermo Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden) and SpIgE value of &#x02265;0.35 kU<sub>A</sub>/L was interpreted as positive with range from 0.35-over 100 kU<sub>A</sub>/L.</p><p>Food challenges were mainly performed in an open fashion (n = 297) with 9 challenges carried out by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). The method of open and double-blind OFC was performed following standard recommended protocol [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During the early part of the study (prior to 2010), DBPCFC was performed using placebo and active foods packed in capsules [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This was later changed to the current recommendation using masking media suitable for individualized foods suspected [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Food challenges were supervised by allergists/allergy fellows prior to, during, and after challenges to classify negative/positive reactions. Positive challenges were defined when patients developed significant symptoms/signs in one or more of the following body systems; cutaneous system (maculopapular rash, urticaria, angioedema), respiratory system (rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing), gastrointestinal system (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea), neurological system (drowsiness, sudden change of behavior, change of consciousness, convulsion), and cardiovascular system (hypotension, cardiovascular collapse). The study was reviewed and approved by the Human Ethic Committee of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital (approval number: 394/2556).</p><p>During the study period, there were 2 separate major studies on food allergy involving OFC conducted at our institute (on shrimp and wheat allergy). For the shrimp study, 68 patients with convincing history of shrimp allergy and with positive skin testing to shrimp extracts were challenged on separate sessions to large water shrimp (<italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic>) and to large tiger prawn (<italic>Paneus monodon</italic>) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Twenty-five patients from the shrimp study was included in this review (with 7 gave positive results &#x02013; 28%). The wheat OFC study involved those with definite wheat allergy at one point of time in life to determine the natural history of wheat allergy [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Eleven patients were included in this review (with 5 positive challenge &#x02013; 45%).</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive analysis were used for describing demographic data, results of OFC, type of foods, frequencies of symptoms and signs of positive/negative challenges. Association between results of challenges pertaining to demographic data, skin testing, SpIgE were analyzed by using the chi-square test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age (&#x000b1;standard deviation [SD]) of the 206 patients were 5.85 &#x000b1; 4.22 years (range, 4 months to 17 years).

[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, patients in this study included those previously recruited for our shrimp and wheat studies, we therefore anticipated a much higher positive OFC rate. Since this is a retrospective data, we were not able to collect complete data on presenting symptoms that may/may not be used for predicting positive challenges. Surprisingly more females gave positive OFC than males which is in contrast to findings reported on epidemiology of food allergy, particularly in younger ages [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that some of shrimp challenges (25 challenges) was recruited from our previous of shrimp study, results of positive challenges (28%) among these patients were lower than overall positive shrimp challenge in this review (40%). This indicates that shrimp is truly a major food allergy among Thai children, confirming the results of previous epidemiologic study that shrimp are the most important foods causing allergic reactions among older children in Thailand [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, wheat was the second most common food giving positive challenge (total positive rate of 40%). Seven out of 10 children with age less than 3 years had positive wheat OFC whereas the rate is lower for those over 3 years old (31.5%). This suggests that wheat allergy can present quite early in life. As with shrimp, a small number of wheat OFC (11 patients) was from our previous study on natural history of wheat allergy in children. Since eggs was the food with the largest number of subjects recruited for OFC in this review (n = 76) follows by cow's milk (n = 66) and wheat (n = 48), we therefore feel that selection of subjects in our study reflected the real clinical situation occurring in the Thai community. In addition, the result of our study supports the notion by several Thai allergists that there is an increase in numbers of children with wheat allergy in Thailand. A large scale epidemiologic study for wheat allergy in Thailand is warranted.</p><p>It is of note that systemic reactions from shrimp from this study were quite serious. Eight of 29 patients with shrimp sensitivity developed symptoms to more than one body system, some of which was severe reactions. However, no anaphylaxis was observed with shrimp challenges (only 1 patient had anaphylaxis during a wheat challenge). Similar to a report from Singapore, oral allergy syndrome was only observed among those with positive shrimp challenge [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, positive OFC occurred only in 30% of patients in this review. This confirmed that OFC is needed to confirm the diagnosis of food allergy. Shrimp allergy was the most common cause of positive challenges. A large number of wheat OFC in this study suggested an increase in wheat allergy in Thailand.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> Conceptualization: Pakit Vichyanond.
