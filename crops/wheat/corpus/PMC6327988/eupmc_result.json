    "AbstractAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors are interesting compounds for different therapeutic applications, among which Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the inhibition of these cholinesterases with uracil derivatives. The mechanism of inhibition of these enzymes was observed to be due to obstruction of the active site entrance by the inhibitors scaffold. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the possible key interactions between the studied ligands and amino acid residues at different regions of the active sites of AChE and BuChE. Being diverse of the classical AChE and BuChE inhibitors, the investigated uracil derivatives may be used as lead molecules for designing new therapeutically effective enzyme inhibitors."
