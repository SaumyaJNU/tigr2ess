    "In order to improve the detection accuracy for the quality of wheat, a recognition method for wheat quality using the terahertz (THz) spectrum and multi-source information fusion technology is proposed. Through a combination of the absorption and the refractive index spectra of samples of normal, germinated, moldy, and worm-eaten wheat, support vector machine (SVM) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory with different kernel functions were used to establish a classification fusion model for the multiple optical indexes of wheat. The results showed that the recognition rate of the fusion model for wheat samples can be as high as 96%. Furthermore, this approach was compared to the regression model based on single-spectrum analysis. The results indicate that the average recognition rates of fusion models for wheat can reach 90%, and the recognition rate of the SVM radial basis function (SVM-RBF) fusion model can reach 97.5%. The preliminary results indicated that THz-TDS combined with DS evidence theory analysis was suitable for the determination of the wheat quality with better detection accuracy."
