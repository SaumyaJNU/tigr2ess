    "Eriophyoid mites (Acari Eriophyoidea) are phytophagous arthropods forming intimate relationships with their host plants. These mites are associated with annual and perennial plants including ferns, and are highly specialized with a dominant monophagy. They can be classified in different ecological classes, i.e., vagrant, gall-making and refuge-seeking species. Many of them are major pests and some of them are vectors of plant pathogens. This paper critically reviews the knowledge on eriophyoids of agricultural importance with emphasis on sources for host plant resistance to these mites. The role of species belonging to the family Eriophyidae as vectors of plant viruses is discussed. Eriophyoid-host plant interactions, the susceptibility within selected crops and main host plant tolerance/resistance mechanisms are discussed. Fundamental concepts, subjects, and problems emerged in this review are pointed out and studies are suggested to clarify some controversial points."
