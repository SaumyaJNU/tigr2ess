    "Solid-state fermentation has a special advantage of preventing the foaming problem that obstructs submerged fermentation processes for rhamnolipid production. In the present work, a 50:50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal was selected as the optimum substrate for rhamnolipid production using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant 15GR and an impregnating solution including 5% v/v glycerol. Using Box-Behnken design, the optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size 1% v/v, temperature 30 °C and unlike other studies, pH 8. These optimized conditions yielded a 67% enhancement of rhamnolipid levels reaching 46.85 g rhamnolipids per liter of impregnating solution, after 10 days, which was about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained by submerged liquid fermentation. Although maximum rhamnolipids concentration was obtained after 10 days of incubation, rhamnolipids concentration already reached high levels (41.87 g/l) after only 6 days. This rhamnolipid level was obtained in a shorter time and using lower carbon source concentrations than most studies reported so far. The findings obtained indicate an enormous potential for employing solid-state fermentation for rhamnolipid production by the studied isolate."
