    "Introduction:Salicylic acid is a derivative of benzoic acid and occurs in nature. The main target of this study was to develop the liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technique as a method for determination of salicylic acid in feed materials and compound feed. Material and Methods:Salicylic acid was extracted from feed with 0.1% hydrochloric acid in methanol. Separation was achieved in 8 min in a gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile. The analyte was detected using negative electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure was validated to the specifications of the European Commission Decision No. 2002/657/EC. Results:The validation results showed the repeatability of the method, which was evaluated at three levels (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg). Calibration curves for the working ranges were linear (R2 0.9911 to 0.9936), and recoveries ranged from 98.3% to 101%. The LOD and LOQ for compound feed were 0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. Salicylic acid was found mostly in corn, and its concentrations differed depending on whether it was young or fully grown (5.30-12.8 mg/kg and 0.13-1.01 mg/kg, respectively). Conclusions:A sensitive and reliable method for the determination of salicylic acid in feed and compound feed using LC-MS/MS was developed."
