However, in temperate wheat growing regions the soil-borne fungal pathogen <italic>Gaeumannomyces tritici</italic> becomes a major constraint on productivity. In cultivar rotation field experiments on the Rothamsted Farm&#x000a0;(Hertfordshire, UK) we demonstrated a substantial reduction in take-all disease and grain yield increases of up to 2.4 tonnes/ha when a low take-all inoculum building wheat cultivar was grown in the first year of wheat cropping. Phenotyping of 71 modern elite wheat cultivars for the take-all inoculum build-up trait across six diverse trial sites identified a few cultivars which exhibited a consistent lowering of take-all inoculum build-up. However, there was also evidence of a significant interaction effect between trial site and cultivar when a pooled Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedure was conducted. There was no evidence of an unusual rooting phenotype associated with take-all inoculum build-up in two independent field experiments and a sand column experiment. Together our results highlight the complex interactions between wheat genotype, environmental conditions and take-all inoculum build-up. Further work is required to determine the underlying genetic and mechanistic basis of this important phenomenon.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Plant pathogens are one of the greatest threats to global food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Due to economic and technological factors as well as the increasing demand for food there has been a trend to grow many of our major food crops in shorter rotations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, under these conditions there is an increased risk of the build-up of soil-borne plant pathogens and pests that can limit the yields attained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Typically soil-borne diseases have been hard to control due to their broad host ranges, difficulties of targeting the pathogen population in the soil with chemistry and the slow progress when breeding for genetic resistance to root diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The demand for wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is expected to increase by 60% by 2050 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wheatinitiative.org">www.wheatinitiative.org</ext-link>). To meet this demand and protect wheat yield potential it will be essential to effectively control soil-borne pests and pathogens. Worldwide it has been estimated that 40% of wheat crops are not preceded by an effective break crop, forage or fallow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In temperate wheat producing regions the soil-borne fungus <italic>Gaeumannomyces tritici</italic> can then become a major constraint on wheat productivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Fungal inoculum builds up in the soil during the first year of wheat cropping and can then cause severe root disease if a second wheat crop is grown on the same site. The fungus is a necrotrophic pathogen with a relatively broad host range, being able to infect various grass species including the cereal species barley, triticale and rye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moderate and severe take-all infections can result in grain yield losses and poor grain quality. In addition substantial amounts of unused nitrogen fertiliser, mostly in the form of nitrates, can be left behind in the soil due to poor root function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In NW Europe the influence of climate change has been predicted to lead to even greater yield losses due to take-all in the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Genetic resistance to take-all disease remains elusive. Modern hexaploid wheat cultivars are considered fully susceptible to take-all disease, although more distantly related cereal and grass species can show moderate to strong resistance phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, these sources of resistance have still to be successfully transferred into hexaploid wheat. Despite the high susceptibility of hexaploid wheat to take-all disease, we have previously reported on the identification of a novel genetic trait called take-all inoculum build-up (TAB) within semi-modern wheat cultivars when grown as a first wheat crop in the rotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Low TAB cultivars were able to minimise take-all inoculum build-up in the soil as measured using a soil infectivity bioassay taken post-harvest.</p><p id="Par5">In our present study, the first hypothesis to test was whether post-harvest differences in inoculum build-up could be maintained through the inter-crop period to influence the resulting incidence and severity of take-all disease and grain yield in a following second wheat crop in the rotation. Previous research suggests that there can be considerable change in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> inoculum levels during the inter-crop period related to the environmental conditions, management strategy and length of time before sowing the following crop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. To have any impact on disease the differences in inoculum build-up between cultivars that we have previously reported need to be maintained until the sowing of the second crop. It is the amount of viable inoculum in the soil at the time of sowing a susceptible crop that influences the initial primary infection rate in the autumn and the resulting final disease incidence and severity of that crop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In this study we conducted wheat cultivar rotation field trials over multiple field seasons to test and quantify the effect of this new 1<sup>st</sup> wheat genetic trait on second wheat crop health and performance. An added component of these experiments was the inclusion of a range of different commercial elite wheat cultivars in the second wheat position to test whether particular combinations of first and second wheat cultivars work additively, synergistically or antagonistically to maximise or minimise take-all disease severity.</p><p id="Par6">Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the potential practical use of the TAB trait in disease management strategies by testing how robustly the TAB trait was expressed in modern elite wheat cultivars, grown as a first wheat in the rotation, under a range of environmental and agronomic conditions typical of standard wheat cultivation practices in the UK.</p><p id="Par7">Finally, we tested the hypothesis that differences in root number, biomass or deep rooting existed between cultivars with contrasting TAB phenotypes. The mechanism of differential build-up is currently unknown but we postulated that cultivars with higher root numbers, increased root biomass or shallower rooting could potentially exacerbate the build-up of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> inoculum. We examined rooting traits in two independent 1<sup>st</sup> wheat field experiments in different field seasons on the Rothamsted Farm&#x000a0;(Hertfordshire, UK) and in a controlled environment sand column wax layer experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Wheat cultivar rotation field experiments</title><p id="Par8">To explore the impact of the 1<sup>st</sup> wheat take-all inoculum build-up trait on take-all root disease severity and grain yield in the following second wheat crop, four rotation field trials were done over the period 2009 to 2013 in Hertfordshire, UK. In year 1 large strips of the low TAB cultivar Cadenza or the high TAB cultivar Hereward were grown followed in year 2 by one of eight UK commercial cultivars. As expected in each trial, the take-all inoculum build-up in the 1<sup>st</sup> year was dependent on the wheat cultivar grown (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Overall take-all inoculum levels were high in 2011 and 2012 (average across trial site 2011&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.6% roots infected in soil core bioassay, 2012&#x02009;=&#x02009;27.3%), moderate in 2009 (21.6%) but extremely low in 2010 (&#x0003c;6%). Only under the extremely low build-up conditions in 2010 was no statistically significant effect of first wheat cultivar on take-all build-up observed (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The very low build-up in 2010 is therefore presumed to be a result of the low rainfall and higher temperatures in June and July 2010 compared to the other seasons (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Take-all infectivity of the soil after harvest of the source cultivars (Cadenza and Hereward) grown as a first wheat crop in the rotation.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="4">Post-harvest soil core bioassay</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Logit % roots infected with take-all (back-transformed means)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Source cultivar</td><td>2009/R/CS/688<sup>1</sup></td><td>2010/R/CS/706<sup>2</sup></td><td>2011/R/CS/719</td><td>2012/R/CS/725</td></tr><tr><td>Cadenza</td><td>&#x02212;1.01 (11.1)</td><td>&#x02212;1.87 (1.8)</td><td>&#x02212;0.73 (18.4)</td><td>&#x02212;0.94 (12.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Hereward</td><td>&#x02212;0.67 (20.1)</td><td>&#x02212;1.72 (2.6)</td><td>&#x02212;0.31 (34.7)</td><td>&#x02212;0.24 (37.6)</td></tr><tr><td>d.f.</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>SED (logits)</td><td>0.084</td><td>0.173</td><td>0.115</td><td>0.150</td></tr><tr><td>F Probability</td><td>0.027</td><td>0.450</td><td>0.034</td><td>0.019</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1</sup>Rothamsted field trial codes.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Dry weather from April-July 2010 restricted take-all build-up.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par9">To explore the combined effects of wheat genetics and environmentally induced alterations to take-all inoculum levels in the soil on second wheat performance, take-all root disease levels as well as grain and straw yield of the second wheat crop were determined using eight distinct UK wheat cultivars selected from the four nabim (National Association of British and Irish Millers) end use quality categories. These were the group 1 wheats with consistent bread making quality Gallant, Hereward, Solstice and Xi19, group 2 wheats with bread-making potential Cordiale and Einstein, group 3 biscuit making wheat Robigus and group 4 feed wheat Duxford.

This formally tested our hypothesis that 1<sup>st</sup> wheat cultivar dependent post-harvest differences in TAB are maintained into the following second wheat crop to alter the resulting take-all disease severity and yield. Differences in the amount of take-all disease in the second wheat crop were already apparent at the beginning of stem elongation in the spring and these differences were maintained as the crown root system developed until the summer sampling period during grain filling. Importantly this effect on take-all disease severity and yield was independent of the second wheat cultivar grown i.e. first and second wheat effects were additive. There was some evidence of a main effect of second wheat cultivar on take-all severity suggesting there may be further opportunities to minimise take-all disease by appropriate second wheat cultivar choice. The effect of second wheat cultivar choice on yield was less clear and would need to be explored in further field trials which compared yields in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> wheat situations within the same field trial&#x000a0;and season (eg. by including a fallow treatment in year 1).</p><p id="Par25">In two further seasons, sampling selected AHDB winter wheat 1<sup>st</sup> wheat field trials revealed that variation for the TAB trait was present in elite cultivars, currently grown by commercial farmers, but that there were complex interactions between year, trial site and cultivar. This was particularly noticeable for the percentage of plants infected with take-all in the soil core bioassay. This suggests that multiple low or high TAB mechanisms exist within this set of elite wheat cultivars which are then influenced in different ways by the site specific environmental and agronomic conditions. However, it was still possible to identify a small number of cultivars which show a consistent reduction in TAB across all of their trial sites.</p><p id="Par26">Two of the most consistent cultivars found to provide the low TAB trait were Gallant and Grafton. Both Grafton (parentage&#x02009;=&#x02009;Cordiale &#x000d7; CPBT W97) and Gallant (parentage&#x02009;=&#x02009;(Malacca &#x000d7; Charger) &#x000d7; Xi19) are derived from the low TAB cultivar Cadenza via Cordiale and Xi19 (Pedigree information obtained from AHDB winter wheat pocketbooks <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/">https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par27">To begin to dissect the mechanisms underlying the TAB trait, field and non-field analyses were done to explore specific root traits. Using a controlled environment sand column growth assay, previous studies had linked root penetration through a buried weak or strong wax layer to shallow or deep rooting phenotypes under field conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In our study, both Cadenza and Hereward were able to penetrate the strong wax layer to a limited extent. However, neither cultivar showed an increased ability to penetrate the strong wax layer indicating that&#x000a0;they are unlikely to possess deep rooting traits in the field. No differences in total root number or total root biomass were identified between Cadenza and Hereward. However, when partitioned into the root mass collected either above or below the wax layer, Cadenza had a greater dry weight above the wax layer regardless of wax strength whereas Hereward was able to maintain a wider lateral root spread under the more challenging strong wax growing conditions. In all other respects, the root spread of the two cultivars were similar. In the field experiments there were also no differences in either crown root number or root biomass between the two cultivars. Collectively, these results do not support the hypothesis that increased root biomass or an unusual root architecture is associated with higher take-all inoculum build-up.</p><p id="Par28">The soil core bioassay method used to phenotype the cultivars for the TAB trait is a measure of the infective ability of take-all inoculum in the soil.

The <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species group was chosen for investigation because first wheat cultivar choice had the largest impact on this species group within the bacterial community. The <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species group is also of interest because of the reported influence of these bacteria in the build-up of suppressive soils and biological control of take-all disease associated with continuous wheat cropping known as take-all decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Analysis of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> populations in year 2 of one of the rotation experiments revealed that, similarly to take-all, there was a substantial effect of first wheat cultivar choice on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> populations from the wheat rhizosphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Further investigations by Mehrabi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> demonstrated that a higher <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> species richness was associated with increased take-all disease severity and lower yields. In complementary experimental laboratory microcosm experiments an increase in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genotypic diversity impaired the ability of the community to limit <italic>G</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> fungal growth. Under controlled environment experiments other researchers have also demonstrated that the build-up of take-all suppressive fluorescent <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> populations and metabolite production from these populations are influenced by the wheat cultivar grown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Together these results suggest that there may be opportunities to manipulate rhizosphere microbiome development under field conditions for the control of take-all disease using wheat genetics.</p><p id="Par30">The success of the rhizosphere microbiome strategy may be influenced by the composition of the native soil microbiome across different sites. It is already well acknowledged that soil microbial communities differ due to a range of site specific environmental and soil characteristics including pH, nutrient availability, soil moisture, temperature and organic matter content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and previous studies have identified significant soil-type dependent effects on both bulk and rhizosphere soil microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Core differences in the starting soil microbiome and thus the available taxa to be recruited into the plant rhizosphere and endosphere compartments may also help to explain the significant cultivar x site interaction across the AHDB Recommended List trial sites. Despite the significant cultivar x site interaction there were a small number of cultivars which demonstrated a consistent reduction in TAB across all six sites. This raises the possibility that some cultivars can operate more flexibly across a range of soil types, perhaps recruiting different microbial taxa, depending on the starting native community, but which have the same functional effect on take-all inoculum build-up. Future work should focus on the exploring the differences in the soil, rhizosphere and endosphere microbiome of wheat cultivars in relation to the TAB phenotype across different field sites to investigate this potential interaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Wheat cultivar rotation field experiments</title><p id="Par31">Four winter wheat rotation field experiments, each of 2 years duration, were conducted on the Rothamsted Farm (Hertfordshire, UK) during the period 2008&#x02013;2013. Trials were drilled in the autumn on well-structured flinty, silt clay loam soil (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The trials were arranged as randomised block designs using CycDesigN (VSN International Limited, Hemel Hempstead, UK). In year 1 four replicates of Cadenza (low TAB cultivar) and Hereward (high TAB cultivar) were sown as large plots of 12&#x02009;m x 78 or 82&#x02009;m. In Year 2 each of the large plots of Cadenza or Hereward from year 1 were divided into eight 3&#x02009;m x 9 or 10&#x02009;m plots and drilled with one of eight commercial winter wheat cultivars (Cordiale, Duxford, Einstein, Gallant, Hereward, Robigus, Solstice and Xi19). Cultivars were chosen to cover a selection of end use quality groups (including bread, biscuit and feed wheats) and 2<sup>nd</sup> wheat yield performance. Trials were drilled at a seed rate of 350 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>, but were raised (500 seeds/m<sup>2</sup>) for the Cadenza plots in the 1<sup>st</sup> rotation trial (field trial code 09/R/CS/688) due to poor performance of this seed batch in germination tests.
