    "BACKGROUND:Wheat breeding over the last 100â€‰years has increased productivity by adapting genotypes to local conditions, but the genomic changes and selection signals that caused phenotypic change during breeding are essentially unknown. Studying and understanding human selection of multiple important genes controlling key phenotypic traits will promote wheat molecular breeding. RESULTS:A total of 1152 diverse global wheat materials were genotyped based on KASP markers from 47 genes controlling grain yield, grain quality, adaptation, and stress resistance. Significant phenotypic variations between landraces and modern cultivars were found in 11 adaptive and yield-related traits. Thirty-six improvement-selective favorable alleles, including 22 positive prolonged and 14 negative selection alleles, were identified through comparing frequency spectra. Sus1-7A-Hap-H, Sus1-7B-Hap-T, Sus2-2A-Hap-A, TGW6-A1a, Cwi-4A-Hap-C, vrn-A1, PHS1-PHS+ and Lr34+ were subjected to strong selection, and overwhelmingly strong selection had occurred before improvement selection at Psy-A1b, Psy-B1a or b, Psy-D1a and Cwi-5D-Hap-C. However, Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b and 1BL.1RS were rare or absent in Chinese landraces but present in modern Chinese cultivars and introduced accessions. Importantly, Lr68+, Fhb1+, Wx-B1b and Yr15+, currently existing at a low frequency, should be regarded as further major improvement targets in global wheat breeding. Gene flow analysis showed that introduced cultivars especially from the former USSR and Italy contributed to enriched genetic variation in modern Chinese cultivars. CONCLUSIONS:This work objectively reports human selection on favorable alleles of multiple crucial genes in Asia, Europe, North America and CIMMYT, and traces the distribution of important genes in global wheat for molecular breeding."
