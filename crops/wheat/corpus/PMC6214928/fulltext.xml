We addressed submergence stress response of wheat that has become increasingly important but remained largely uninvestigated. Our primary aim was to disclose cytoplasmic diversity using nucleus-cytoplasm (NC) hybrids possessing a series of heterologous cytoplasms in a common nuclear background. Effects of submergence on seedling emergence and growth from imbibed seeds were studied and compared with euplasmic lines. Marked phenotypic variabilities were observed among both lines, demonstrating divergent cytoplasmic and nuclear effects on submergence response. NC hybrids with cytoplasm of <italic>Aegilops mutica</italic> showed a less inhibition, indicative of their positive contribution to submergence tolerance, whereas cytoplasms of <italic>Aegilops umbellulata</italic> and related species caused a greater inhibition. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity showed a marked increase accompanied by retardation of seedling growth in a susceptible NC hybrid. The observation suggested that the elevated SOD activity was resulted from a high level of reactive oxygen species accumulated and remained in susceptible seedlings. Taken together, our results point to the usefulness of NC hybrids in further studies needed to clarify molecular mechanisms underlying the nucleus-cytoplasm interaction regulating submergence stress response in wheat.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Research Institute for Food and Agriculture, Ryukoku University</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Plants possess three interacting and coevolving genomes in three intracellular organelles, <italic>i.e</italic>. nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. A vast majority of genetic information is stored in the nuclear genomes, whereas small numbers of protein-coding as well as non-coding genes reside in the two cytoplasmic genomes. Although small in size, owing to their essential roles in energy metabolisms, unique evolution through endosymbiosis and complex functional interactions with nuclear genomes, cytoplasmic genomes have provided researchers with many attractive subjects in plant science<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In contrast to nuclear genomes exhibiting Mendelian inheritance, cytoplasmic genomes compartmentalized in mitochondria and chloroplasts are generally inherited through maternal lineage in a majority of plant species. Taking advantage of this characteristic unilateral mode of inheritance, cytoplasms of related genera and species can be combined with given nuclei through repeated substitution backcrosses with recurrent paternal parents. To study intergeneric and interspecific diversity among cytoplasms in <italic>Triticum</italic> (wheat) and <italic>Aegilops</italic> (goatgrass) species, Kihara (1951) produced nucleus-cytoplasm substitution lines or nucleus-cytoplasm hybrids (hereafter abbreviated as NC hybrids, synonymous with alloplasmic lines and cytolines) and demonstrated that cytoplasm of <italic>Ae. caudata</italic> induced male sterility when it was introduced into common wheat (<italic>T. aestivum</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This was the first demonstration of cytoplasmic male sterility in wheat. Ever since, a number of NC hybrids have been produced and utilized as valuable experimental materials in studying phylogeny and evolution of the tribe Triticeae. Particularly in the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> complex that comprises a series of diploid, allotetraploid and allohexaploid species evolved through hybridization followed by amphidiploidization between ancestral species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a collection of 552 lines of NC hybrids have been produced by combining 12 different nuclear genomes of common wheat with 46 distinct cytoplasmic genomes covering all representative cytoplasms in the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Based on extensive and systematic studies of cytoplasmic effects on fourteen vegetative and seven reproductive traits exhibited in these NC hybrids together with their chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA variations, cytoplasms of the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> complex were classified into 18 major types plus five subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. NC hybrids thus contributed to establish the evolutional history in <italic>Triticum</italic> and <italic>Aegilops</italic> and greatly increased our knowledge of genetic architecture of both nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Studies of interspecific and intergeneric diversity in cytoplasms and nucleus-cytoplasm interactions have been extended to various phenotypes including male-sterility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, growth vigor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, inter-crossability and speciation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, photosynthesis and respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, transcriptomes and metabolomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and other agronomically important traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In such studies, hexaploid and tetraploid NC hybrids with cytoplasms of <italic>Triticum</italic>, <italic>Aegilops</italic>, <italic>Agropyron, Haynaldia</italic> and a wild relative of barley <italic>Hordeum chilense</italic> have been used. In maize also, NC hybrids with cytoplasms from teosinte including distantly related <italic>Zea</italic> species exhibited differences in morphological, physiological and developmental traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In the last decade, studies of a model plant species, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, have demonstrated intraspecific diversity of cytoplasms and nucleus-cytoplasm interactions both affecting a wide range of plant phenotypes. Studies using reciprocal F<sub>2</sub> families or recombinant inbred lines showed variations in cytoplasmic genomes and cytonuclear interactions (synonymous with nucleus-cytoplasm interactions) that greatly affected natural variations in germination capacity and metabolomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Intraspecific cytonuclear interactions affecting various adaptive phenotypes in the fields have also been reported in a study using 56 cytolines produced by complete diallele crosses among eight natural <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">As above, inter- and intraspecific and intergeneric diversity of cytoplasms and nucleus-cytoplasm interactions affecting various phenotypes have been well investigated and documented in plants. However, contribution and role of cytoplasms in regulating complex adaptive traits, particularly responses to adverse environmental stresses in cereal crops, remain largely uninvestigated, although cytoplasmic genomes and nucleus-cytoplasm genome interaction have been known to play important roles in stress tolerance, signaling and adaptation in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Submergence (complete inundation) and waterlogging (saturation of soil with water) caused by floods and heavy rainfalls have become serious threats in wheat production due to global climate changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Submergence together with waterlogging were reported to cause 15&#x02013;20% yield reduction of wheat in the world, causing ever-increasing loss particularly in Asian countries where rice-wheat rotation is in a wide practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, as compared with semiaquatic rice, our current knowledge of submergence/waterlogging stress response of wheat is quite limited. Because of the importance of this trait in rice, a large volume of research has been conducted and advanced our understanding of genetic, physiological, morphological and molecular mechanisms controlling the trait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Two major strategies, i.e., &#x0201c;quiescent strategy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;elongation or escape strategy&#x0201d;, have been known to be responsible for controlling submergence tolerance in rice. <italic>SUB1A</italic>, a gene encoding an ethylene responsive transcription factor (AP2/ERF), plays a key role in the operation of &#x0201c;quiescent strategy&#x0201d; by repressing cellular gibberellin levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. By contrast, <italic>SNORKEL 1, 2</italic>, also encoding ethylene responsive transcription factors, play a key role in &#x0201c;elongation strategy&#x0201d; in deep-water or floating rice by enhancing gibberellin responses to induce rapid internode elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We focused on submergence stress response in wheat and initiated a study of cytoplasmic genetic diversity affecting seedling emergence and growth after subjecting imbibed seeds to submergence stress. To do this, we used a series of NC hybrids possessing heterologous cytoplasms derived from the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> complex combined with a common nucleus of a paternal donor parent, and compared their response to that of wheat accessions covering a wide range of genetic diversity. Also, we compared superoxide dismutase activity as a major antioxidant enzyme among a nuclear donor and tolerant and susceptible NC hybrids and discussed a possible involvement of cytoplasmic substitution in redox balance affecting submergence stress response. We herein report results providing the first experimental evidence for a large genetic diversity in both cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes affecting submergence stress response in wheat. Also, we point to the invaluable usefulness of NC hybrids as materials in further studies to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying nucleus-cytoplasm interactions that regulate submergence stress response in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sensitivity of growing seedlings and imbibed seeds to submergence stress in a nuclear donor cultivar CS</title><p id="Par6">Test tube bioassay developed for rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> was adopted with modifications for wheat. Before studying cytoplasmic effects, we examined suitability of the bioassay method for evaluation of submergence stress response in wheat using a nuclear donor of standard common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (abbreviated as CS). A time course of seedling growth without submergence was first studied using seeds imbibed for 1&#x02009;day. Seed germination was 100% and seedlings continued to grow until the end of the incubation period in test tubes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Shoot length (length of either the first leaf or coleoptile depending on growth stage) and total seedling fresh weight continuously increased, whereas root length reached a plateau after 14 days of incubation, indicating that root growth was restricted during the later stages even without submergence stress under our bioassay conditions. Sensitivity of growing seedlings to submergence stress was then studied by adding deionized water to fully cover 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-day-old seedlings and keeping them submerged for additional 7 days. Submergence stress thus imposed on growing seedlings markedly suppressed further growth, showing that wheat seedlings were highly sensitive to complete submergence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Magnitude of inhibition was high, irrespective of time when the stress was administered. Photos of representative seedlings under different incubation conditions were shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d,e</xref>. It was noted that under submergence the first leaves became necrotic at the junction of and above the top of coleoptile (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), showing that strong damage occurred in this region of the first leaves.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Inhibition of seedling growth by submergence imposed on seedlings and imbibed seeds.

Submerged seeds were then incubated under de-submergence conditions for additional 10 days for germination and subsequent seedling growth. Seed germination rate was 100% until 3&#x02013;5 days of seed submergence and then declined steadily to 60% at the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> day. Seedling growth assessed by all five traits (shoot length and fresh weight, root length and fresh weight, and total seedling fresh weight) reached peaks after 1 to 3 days of submergence and thereafter declined gradually over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The result showed that an optimum period of seed imbibition was about 2&#x02009;days under the assay conditions, and that the prolonged period of submergence gave strong stress on imbibed seeds and inhibited subsequent germination and seedling growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cytoplasmic diversity in NC hybrids assessed by seedling growth with and without submergence</title><p id="Par8">We studied effects of cytoplasmic genome substitution on seed germination and seedling growth after treating imbibed seeds with and without submergence using 37 lines of NC hybrids, each possessing one of 24 distinct cytoplasm types derived from the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> complex (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Three bioassay schemes were adopted for assessing the sensitivity to submergence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

On the other hand, based on chloroplast DNA polymorphisms, a cluster of T<sup>2</sup> and T cytoplasms were in close proximity to a cluster of U cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Similarity estimation of cytoplasms thus differed depending on different criteria used. Nevertheless, our phenotypic assessment of submergence stress response and clustering analysis suggest the uniqueness of T<sup>2</sup>, T and U and its derivative U&#x02019; cytoplasms in the <italic>Triticum</italic>-<italic>Aegilops</italic> complex.</p><p id="Par18">As discussed above, marked diversity was evident among heterologous cytoplasms affecting submergence stress response in the nuclear background of CS. An important question was how large or small was the cytoplasmic contribution compared to the nuclear contribution. In wheat, much more efforts have been devoted to study waterlogging than submergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A clear genetic diversity was reported to exist in waterlogging tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. For submergence, bread wheat was reported more tolerant than durum wheat and barley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We studied nuclear diversity using 12 wheat lines covering a wide range of morphological and geographical diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. A large variability was observed among these hexaploid wheat lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Furthermore, the comparison of overall coefficients of variation among them and NC hybrids showed that cytoplasmic diversity observed in the nuclear background of CS was as large as over 60% that of nuclear diversity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The observed difference suggested divergent response in NC hybrids that might be due to cytoplasmic differences exerted through nucleus-cytoplasm interactions.</p><p id="Par19">Various mechanisms that control metabolism, growth, morphological characteristics and gene expression under submergence have been reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Submergence is known to limit oxygen diffusion into plant cells and tissues causing hypoxic damage, which is mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. De-submergence is also detrimental because oxidative stress disturbs physiological processes producing ROS upon exposure to aerial oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It is crucial to understand how heterologous cytoplasms regulate submergence stress response. Therefore, as the first step, we studied the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which acts in the conversion of superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD is composed of metalloenzymes Fe-SOD localized in chloroplasts, Mn-SOD in mitochondria and peroxisomes, and Cu/Zn-SOD in many cellular compartments including the three organelles. We measured a total SOD activity by adopting experimental schemes, in which effects of hypoxic stress on imbibed seeds during prolonged submergence and possible oxidative stress upon and during de-submergence could simultaneously be studied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Comparisons of the activity among CS and three NC hybrids showing contrasting levels of submergence tolerance revealed a marked increase of SOD activity in C26 with U cytoplasm of <italic>Ae. triuncialis</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which showed a higher susceptibility than the others (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Redox homeostasis is maintained by the balance between the production and scavenging of ROS. Among many enzymatic ROS scavenging systems, SOD is known as a major defense factor against ROS produced and accumulated under various environmental stresses in plants including wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. We measured the total activity of SOD in seedlings grown for 7 days after subjecting imbibed seeds to submergence for 3 days. We observed an elevated SOD activity in seedlings of the susceptible NC line C26 in comparison with the nuclear donor CS and the tolerant lines C14 and C13 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The result seemed to conflict with reports showing that stress tolerant genotypes tended to maintain higher levels of antioxidative capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It has also been known that SOD activity and ROS level do not necessarily show a positive correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, our observation is notable in that the elevated SOD activity was accompanied by the growth retardation in the susceptible seedlings. Germination started, as judged by the elongation of coleoptile length longer than 15&#x02009;mm, at around the 4th day of incubation of submerged seeds in the nuclear donor and the tolerant lines, but germination in the susceptible line was delayed, leading to the retarded seedling growth. This suggested that high levels of oxidative stress due to elevated ROS levels were remained in the susceptible seedlings that emerged from the submerged seeds. Production and detoxification of ROS is affected by various factors including the duration and intensity of applied stresses, tissue types and developmental stages. To clarify the relationship between these two complex processes regulating submergence stress response, it is necessary to follow the detailed time course of production, accumulation and detoxification of ROS at the early stages of seedling emergence and growth.</p><p id="Par21">Taken together, we posit that significant diversity affecting submergence response exists among different cytoplasms of the <italic>Triticum-Aegilops</italic> complex. In plants, various adaptive traits including abiotic stress responses are predicted to be under control of nucleus-cytoplasms interaction, both through anterograde and retrograde regulation, in the latter of which various signaling factors generated by cytoplasmic organellar genomes can regulate gene expression of target nuclear genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Further comparative studies of NC hybrids with different nuclear backgrounds are needed to clarify molecular mechanisms explaining how cytoplasmic genomes can regulate the submergence stress response through the interaction with nuclear genomes in wheat.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par22">Thirty-seven NC hybrids and 12 euplasmic wheat lines were used (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Sensitivity of seedlings was studied by adding 15&#x02009;ml of deionized water to cover growing seedlings at indicated time points and keeping them submerged for additional 7 days. Sensitivity of imbibed seeds was also studied by immersing 15 seeds at each time point continuously for up to 11 days followed by incubation under de-submergence conditions for additional 10 days for germination and subsequent seedling growth.
