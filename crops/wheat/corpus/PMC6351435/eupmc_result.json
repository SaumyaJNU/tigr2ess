    "In this study, a low-cost composite adsorbent was prepared from snail shell and rice husk (SS-RH) through calcination for brilliant green dye (BGD) adsorption from aqueous solution. Six two-parameter and three three-parameter isotherm models were used to fit the experimental data by both linear and non-linear regression methods using ten error functions. Linear and non-linear regression analysis coupled with linear and non-linear fit error functions all revealed Langmuir and Sip as two- and three-parameter isotherm models well-fitted for BGD uptake from aqueous solution using calcined particles (CPs) of SS-RH. Chi-square (Ï‡2) error function proved to be the best applicable predictive error function for the two-parameter isotherm study while sum of absolute error (EABS), hybrid functional error (HYBRID) and normalized standard deviation (NSD) are the best error functions for non-linear Redlich-Peterson, Sips and Toth three-parameter isotherm models respectively. Irregular surface texture was observed for the calcined particles of SS-RH as revealed by SEM with BGD filling the opening pores after adsorption. FTIR revealed shift in spectrum broad peaks after adsorption. EDS exhibited active mixed metal oxides formation before adsorption with the observance of weight percent change after adsorption."
