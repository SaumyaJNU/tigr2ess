Many of the genes controlling these processes have been identified and their responses to Al treatment described in detail. This study investigated how the major Al resistance traits of wheat and rye are transferred to triticale (x <italic>Tritosecale</italic> Wittmack) which is a hybrid between wheat and rye. We generated octoploid and hexaploid triticale lines and compared them with the parental lines for their relative resistance to Al, organic anion efflux and expression of some of the genes encoding the transporters involved. We report that the strong Al resistance of rye was incompletely transferred to octoploid and hexaploid triticale. The wheat and rye parents contributed to the Al-resistance of octoploid triticale but the phenotypes were not additive. The Al resistance genes of hexaploid wheat, <italic>TaALMT1</italic>, and <italic>TaMATE1B</italic>, were more successfully expressed in octoploid triticale than the Al resistance genes in rye tested, <italic>ScALMT1</italic> and <italic>ScFRDL2</italic>. This study demonstrates that an important stress-tolerance trait derived from hexaploid wheat was expressed in octoploid triticale. Since most commercial triticale lines are largely hexaploid types it would be beneficial to develop techniques to generate genetically-stable octoploid triticale material. This would enable other useful traits that are present in hexaploid but not tetraploid wheat, to be transferred to triticale.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>roots</kwd><kwd>acid soil</kwd><kwd>malate</kwd><kwd>citrate</kwd><kwd><italic>Secale cereal</italic>e</kwd><kwd><italic>Triticum aestivum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="8038"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many important crop species are stable allopolyploids resulting from hybridisations between two separate but related species. Triticale (&#x000d7; Triticosecale Wittmack) is an allopolyploid because it is a hybrid between rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic> L.) and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.). Triticale is a valuable grain crop that combines useful traits from wheat and rye. Wheat has greater yield and superior grain quality while rye is a forage crop with outstanding resistance to many biotic and abiotic stresses including pathogens, low nutrient availability, soil pH and low temperatures. Wheat is typically used as the female parent and rye as the male parent because crosses are more stable if female plants have the larger ploidy of the two parents. The grain from this hybridisation are often sterile so the zygote from this cross is treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and improve fertility (Mergoum and G&#x000f3;mez-Macpherson, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). When rye (diploid with genome RR) is hybridized with a hexaploid or bread wheat (hexaploid with genome AABBDD) the result is an &#x0201c;octoploid&#x0201d; triticale (AABBDDRR). When rye is hybridized with a tetraploid wheat (AABB) the result is a &#x0201c;hexaploid&#x0201d; triticale (AABBRR). Therefore triticale is amphidiploid meaning that it is diploid for the two parental genomes. Commercial triticale lines are mostly second generation hexaploid types because they often show better stability and performance than the octoploid types (Mergoum and G&#x000f3;mez-Macpherson, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major limitation to crop production on acid soils because the concentration of soluble trivalent cations (Al<sup>3+</sup>) increases when soil pH falls below ~4.5. Many species show a significant genotypic variation in resistance to Al stress and this is also the case for rye and bread wheat but not for durum wheat which is very sensitive of Al. Rye is among the most Al-resistant cereal species along with rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.). Aniol and Gustafson (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) investigated the Al resistance of triticale, wheat and rye and concluded that Al resistance of the wheat parent was an important determinant of the Al resistance of triticale. They also found that the strong resistance of rye was partially suppressed in the hybrid. When that report was published little information was available on the mechanisms of Al resistance in any plant species. It was later revealed that the major mechanisms for Al resistance in wheat and rye involve the release or efflux of malate and citrate anions from the root apices (Li et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Ma et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Delhaize et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Stass et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Ryan et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Stass et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) compared contrasting genotypes of wheat and rye with the triticale hybrids and concluded that the Al resistance of triticale was mostly determined by citrate efflux, a trait that was largely controlled by the wheat genome.</p><p>Differences in malate efflux account for most of the genotypic variation in Al resistance in bread wheat but citrate efflux is important when malate efflux is absent (Ryan et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Malate efflux is facilitated by an anion channel encoded by the <italic>aluminum-activated malate transporter, TaALMT1</italic>, gene on chromosome 4DL (Sasaki et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Raman et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Al-resistant genotypes show a greater constitutive expression of <italic>TaALMT1</italic> in the root apices than sensitive genotypes which is not affected by Al treatment. However, the TaALMT1 protein requires Al<sup>3+</sup> cations to trigger the malate release which means Al rapidly activates malate release (Sasaki et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This rapid activation has been described as a Type I response which is consistent with the channel proteins being constitutively expressed and activated by Al (Ma et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Citrate release from bread wheat is controlled by TaMATE1B, a transporter from the <italic>multidrug and toxic compound exudation</italic> (MATE) family (Ryan et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tovkach et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). TaMATE1B is encoded by a gene on chromosome 4BL. The greater citrate efflux is caused by a transposable element-like insertion near the transcription start site of <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> which results in a greater level of constitutive expression (Tovkach et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Members of these two gene families also control the release of malate and citrate from rye. Fontecha et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) identified a rye homolog of the wheat <italic>TaALMT1</italic> gene on chromosome 7RS and showed that its expression was induced by Al to a greater degree in the resistant cultivar <italic>Ail&#x000e9;s</italic> than the sensitive cultivar <italic>Riodeva</italic>. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Al resistance were subsequently linked to this same region in two separate rye populations (Benito et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Matos et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Collins et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Silva-Navas et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In one of these populations, generated from the <italic>M39A-1-6</italic> (resistant) and <italic>M77A-1</italic> (sensitive) haplotypes, a cluster of <italic>ScALMT</italic> genes and one <italic>ScMATE</italic> gene was located on the 7RS locus (Collins et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The resistant parent had five copies of the <italic>ScALMT</italic> gene and expression of two of these (<italic>ScALMT1-M39.1</italic> and <italic>ScALMT1-M39.2</italic>) was induced by Al in the root apices. By contrast, the sensitive parent had two copies of the <italic>ScALMT</italic> gene but only one (<italic>ScALMT1-M77.1</italic>) was induced by Al (Collins et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Collins et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) was able to segregate the <italic>MATE</italic> gene from the resistance locus indicating that it was not contributing to the variation in Al resistance of that population. Those authors concluded that the <italic>ScALMT</italic> genes on 7RS controlled the Al-dependent efflux of malate from rye.</p><p>The first <italic>MATE</italic> gene in rye associated with citrate efflux from roots was the <italic>ferric reductase-like 2</italic> gene (<italic>ScFRDL2</italic>) (Yokosho et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The expression of <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> in the roots was induced 15-fold by 50 &#x003bc;M Al and closely coincided with the Al-dependent changes in citrate efflux. Another <italic>MATE</italic> gene identified in the same study, <italic>ScFRDL1</italic>, was considered unlikely to be involved in Al resistance because it was induced by iron deficiency and not by Al treatment (Yokosho et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Silva-Navas et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) later examined the population generated from <italic>Ail&#x000e9;s</italic> and <italic>Riodeva</italic> and mapped a <italic>MATE</italic> gene which they named <italic>aluminum-activated citrate transporter 1</italic> (<italic>ScAACT1</italic>) in the Al-resistance QTL on chromosome 7RS. The authors proposed that <italic>ScAACT1, ScFRDL1</italic>, and <italic>ScMATE</italic> are all the same gene but this conclusion remains uncertain. For example, unlike <italic>ScAACT1</italic>, expression of <italic>ScFRDL1</italic> was not induced by Al treatment according to Yokosho et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and the Al resistance QTL excluded the <italic>MATE</italic> gene in the population described by Collins et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Silva-Navas et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) argued that these inconsistencies could be explained partly by differences in the parental lines and partly by differences in the length of treatments and Al concentrations used. Whereas Yokosho et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) used 50 &#x003bc;M Al treatments over 12 h, Silva-Navas et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) used 300 &#x003bc;M Al treatment over 24 h. The relatedness of these <italic>MATE</italic> genes requires further clarification.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to examine how well the Al-resistance traits in the wheat and rye parental lines were transferred to the allopolyploid triticale. Two sets of diverse lines were used for this purpose. One set included octoploid triticale lines generated from an Al-resistant rye and hexaploid wheat. The second set included hexaploid triticale lines generated by crossing a durum line with rye. Measurements were made of relative Al resistance, anion efflux and expression of selected Al-resistance genes in the parental material and triticale lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Genetic material</title><p>Two sets of germplasm were used in the experiments (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Therefore RRL was calculated as (net root growth in Al treatment net root growth in control solution) &#x000d7; 100.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of citrate and malate efflux</title><p>The measurement of organic anion efflux from intact seedlings followed the procedures described previously (Delhaize et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Ryan et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Briefly, seeds were surface sterilized with bleach and thoroughly rinsed in sterile water. In preliminary experiments the seedlings were grown in aerated 20 L tubs with nutrient solution (pH 4.4) or in sterile conical flasks with 20 mL of 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 4.3) on a rotary shaker and exudates collected from excised roots. The large volume of the tubs maintained the root relatively free of microbial contamination and so both growth methods gave similar exudate results. Only results from the tubs are presented here. The excised root segments (eight to twelve per replicate) were washed in small vials with 1 mL of control solution (0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 4.3) for 1 h on a platform shaker (60 rpm). The solutions were rinsed and replaced by 1 mL of treatment solution (control solution with or without 40 &#x003bc;M AlCl<sub>3</sub>) and returned to the shaker for 2 h. After 2 h collection the malate and citrate concentrations in each solution were estimated enzymatically as described by Ryan et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Malate assays used 0.1 mL of each sample and citrate assay used the remaining 0.9 mL. For the citrate assays the solutions were dried on a rotary vacuum drier and resuspended in 80 &#x003bc;L of assay solution as described by Ryan et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Pty. Ltd. (Castle Hill, Australia). The concentrations were corrected to obtain the original malate and citrate contents in each sample and efflux was standardized for the number of apices and time of collection. In other experiments half of the seedlings were pretreated with 30 &#x003bc;M AlCl<sub>3</sub> for at least 24 h prior to measurements as described in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of gene expression</title><p>RNA was extracted from the root apices with the RNeasy PlantMini Kit (Qiagen) after grinding tissues in liquid nitrogen. cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) as recommended using 1 &#x003bc;g RNA of each extraction. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR using the SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) kit on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real Time System. Data were analyzed with the Bio-Rad CFX Manager software. The primers selected for measuring the expression of the Al-resistance genes in wheat and rye were specific for those genes and did not hybridize with sequences in the other species. Primers for <italic>TaALMT1</italic> expression in bread wheat were (5&#x02032;-3&#x02032;) CGTGAAAGCAGCGGAAAGCC (fwd) and CCCTCGACTCACGGTACTAACA (rev). Primers for <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> expression in bread wheat were AGGGTGGTAGCAGTGACTTC (fwd) and GCGGCAATCACCTTCTTGTG (rev). Annealing temperatures during cycling were 67&#x000b0;C for <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> and 61.5&#x000b0;C for <italic>TaALMT1</italic>. The primers for measuring <italic>ScALMT1</italic> expression in rye were GCAAACAATACCGTGGTTGTG (fwd) and ATCCCTCGAGTTAAGGCACC (rev). These primers could amplify products from the expressed copies of <italic>ScALMT1</italic> in the resistant and sensitive haplotypes of rye (<italic>ScALMT1-M39.1, ScALMT1-M39.2, ScALMT1-M77.1</italic>) described by Collins et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). We measured expression of <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> which is one of the candidate Al-resistance genes in rye because its Al-induced expression in the root apices by 50 &#x003bc;M Al is closely correlated with the release of citrate from roots (Yokosho et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Primers used for measuring <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> expression were GGCTGCATTCCAGATTTGCTTG (fwd) and AGAAGCCCCAAGATCAATCCG (rev). Annealing temperatures were 68&#x000b0;C for <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> and <italic>ScALMT1</italic>.</p><p>The reference genes are important in the expression analyses because of the genetic differences between wheat and rye. Therefore the two reference genes chosen have previously been shown to be relatively stable across members of the triticaeae (Paolacci et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gim&#x000e9;nez et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). These gene are glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>; Ta30768, Genbank EF592180) with primers GTTGAGGGTTTGATGACCAC (fwd) TCAGACTCCTCCTTGATAGC (rev) and the cell division control protein (AAA-superfamily of ATPases) (<italic>CDC</italic>; Ta54227) with primers GCCTGGTAGTCGCAGGAGAT (fwd) and ATGTCTGGCCTGTTGGTAGC (rev). In preliminary tests reliable amplicons were generated from wheat, rye and triticale with both sets of reference primers. Relative expression levels of the Al resistance genes were generally similar with both references genes and the results using <italic>CDC</italic> are presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Al resistance was estimated by calculating relative root length (RRL) since this accounts for inherent differences in growth between different species (see above). Since RRL is a ratio of means (net root growth in different treatments) each of which has an error, then the result requires a new accumulated error. The formula for calculating this accumulated error and the procedure used for determining whether two RRL values are statistically different from one another is described previously by Zhou et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The assumptions for this test are that the data are normally distributed and the variances are not different.</p><p>Other statistical analysis used the statistical software in SigmaPlot<sup>TM</sup> ver 14.0. Anion efflux results were analyzed with a one way ANOVA. In cases where the data failed an initial normality test the data were first transformed with the natural log function (<italic>ln</italic>). Analyses were then determined by applying the Student-Newman-Keuls method for multiple pairwise comparisons. Analysis of gene expression was similar and used three biological replicates except as stated. Note that rye was not included in the analysis of the expression of wheat genes, and conversely, wheat lines were not included in the analysis of the expression of rye genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Two sets of germplasm were compared for Al resistance, organic anion efflux and expression of selected Al-resistance genes.

At the highest Al treatment L185 rye was most resistant with 62% RRL while the wheat and triticale lines were similar at 25%. These results indicate that rye could contribute to the Al resistance of triticale because EgretxL185 triticale was significantly more resistant than Egret wheat. However, the Al resistance of rye and wheat was not additive in triticale because the resistance of CarazinhoxL185 was no greater than either the wheat or rye parent. It would be instructive to confirm the Al resistance measured in hydroponics reflects the measurements in field trials with acidic soil.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Al resistance of the wheat and rye parents and the resulting triticale lines.

The results showed some variation between replicated experiments, especially in the triticale lines and rye material so the experiments were repeated several times. In the first series of experiments seedlings were grown in control nutrient solution and then malate and citrate efflux were measured in the presence or absence of Al. This means that the root tips were only exposed to Al for 2 h as exudates were collected. In the absence of Al, malate efflux from all genotypes was less than 0.05 nmol apex<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

This study investigated the transfer of these resistance mechanisms from wheat and rye lines to triticale. The first set of germplasm examined included Al-sensitive (<italic>Egret</italic>) and resistant (<italic>Carazinho</italic>) hexaploid wheat cultivars, an Al-resistant rye (<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold>) and the two octoploid triticale lines generated by crossing each wheat with the rye. All of these lines except for the <italic>Egret</italic> wheat showed strong resistance to Al toxicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The following conclusions can be made from these first set of lines: (1) The wheat and rye parents both contributed to the Al-resistance of octoploid triticale. Support for this conclusion comes from the finding that <italic>Egret</italic>x<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> triticale was significantly more Al-resistant than <italic>Egret</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) which indicates that <bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> contributed to the phenotype.

These responses generally reflected the relative expression of the genes involved. (2) Al resistance of the parental lines was not additive in triticale. This supported by the finding that neither triticale line was more resistant than the rye or Al-resistant wheat parents. (3) Function of the Al resistance genes in hexaploid wheat were more completely transferred to triticale than the rye genes. This is shown by the expression levels of the two wheat genes <italic>TaALMT1</italic> and <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> which were similar in <italic>Carazinho</italic> and <italic>Carazinho</italic>x<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> whereas expression of the rye genes, <italic>ScALMT</italic> and <italic>ScFRDL2</italic>, in triticale was inconsistent (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In a previous study, Stass et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) concluded that the Al resistance of triticale was determined by citrate efflux which was largely controlled by the wheat parent. The present results indicate that malate efflux from hexaploid wheat can also contribute to the resistance of triticale. (4) The expression of the rye <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> gene in triticale depended on the genotype of the wheat parent. This is supported by the observations that relative expression of <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> was significantly greater in <italic>Egret</italic>x<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> than <italic>Carazinho</italic>x<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is interesting to speculate whether this finding is related to the different expression levels of the wheat gene <italic>TaMATE1B</italic> in <italic>Carazinho</italic> and <italic>Egret</italic>.</p><p>The second set of germplasm included a durum wheat (<italic>5020-30</italic>), a pair of closely-related rye lines (<bold><italic>389</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>390</italic></bold>) that differed in Al resistance and the two hexaploid triticale lines generated by crossing each rye with the durum. The main conclusions drawn from those results include the following: (1) Malate and citrate efflux contribute to the Al resistance of <bold><italic>390</italic></bold> rye and these fluxes were correlated with increases in <italic>ScALMT1</italic> and <italic>ScFRDL2</italic> expression in <bold><italic>390</italic></bold> rye. (2) The Al resistance of 390 rye was not fully transferred to the 5020-30 x 390 triticale (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This was consistent with the reduced efflux of organic anions from 5020-30 x 390 compared to the resistant rye (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The Al resistance of these lines appeared to be most closely correlated with citrate efflux and expression of ScFRDL2.</p><p>The important observation from both sets of lines was that the Al resistance of rye was incompletely transferred to triticale&#x02014;whether to a hexaploid or a octoploid triticale. Similar observations have been made previously for other rye genes in triticale (Neves et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Kalinka and Achrem, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). By contrast, the Al resistance traits from hexaploid wheat did transfer more successfully to octoploid triticale.</p><p>The incomplete transfer of the Al-resistance traits of rye to triticale may be explained by the modifications that commonly occur to the genome of <italic>de novo</italic> allopolyploids mentioned above. When related species such as wheat and rye hybridize to form a stable allopolyploid many genes become duplicated and genetic changes that occur can affect gene expression. Furthermore, homeolog copies of all genes in allopolyploids are not expressed equally. Sequences can be lost and mutations generated due to chromosomal rearrangements or transposon activity (Ma and Gustafson, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and gene transcription can be affected by epigenetic modifications and microRNAs (Cheng and Murata, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Kashkush et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kraitshstein et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kalinka and Achrem, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Cytosine residues in DNA are prone to methylation when they occur as CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites (where H represents any nucleotide except guanine) and methylation of gene promoter regions can interfere with transcription. In <italic>de novo</italic> allopolyploids, such as the primary triticale lines used here, DNA methylation appears to be a more important factor decreasing gene expression than genetic instability with some estimates suggesting 1 to 12% of genes are silenced this way (Kashkush et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; He et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mochida et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Bottley et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The homeologous genes from one parent genome in <italic>de novo</italic> allopolyploids can be silenced more than the other parent and this can even vary between different organs (Bottley et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the rye traits are incompletely transferred to triticale because its genome is naive to the polyploid environment and therefore more prone to epigenetic modification. Hexaploid wheat, by contrast, has emerged from two major hybridization events. The first hybridization occurred about 0.5 million years ago between a diploid species (likely <italic>Triticum uratu, AA</italic> genome) and another unknown parent with the <italic>BB</italic> genome which generated an ancestral tetraploid wheat. The second event occurred only 10,000 years ago between a tetraploid species such as <italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> (<italic>BBAA</italic>) and the diploid grass <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> (<italic>DD</italic>) and generated hexaploid wheat. Since wheat has been subject to epigenetic silencing pressure for a long period, its genome is likely to be more resistant to further silencing processes than the rye genome in a wheat-rye hybrid. This idea is consistent with the outcome of previous studies that compared the expression of genes in tetraploid and diploid lines with their expression in <italic>de novo</italic> hexaploid wheat lines. For example, microarray analysis and RNA-seq techniques demonstrated that more genes from the diploid parent had reduced expression levels in the hexaploid line than the tetraploid parent. This indicates an &#x0201c;expression bias&#x0201d; toward the tetraploid genome parent compared to the diploid genome (Akhunova et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Future work will test this hypothesis by investigating how methylation states of specific Al-resistance genes in the wheat and rye parents change in the primary triticale lines.</p><p>Significant variation was detected between certain repeated experiments and in some instances anion fluxes did not correlate well with gene expression. For example, the relative expression of <italic>ScALMT1</italic> in <bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> and <italic>Egret</italic>x<bold><italic>L185</italic></bold> did not reflect the measured fluxes of malate. This variation could be related, in part, to the variable delay in gene induction by Al and the possible involvement of other Al resistance genes not targeted in this study. More than one <italic>ALMT</italic> and <italic>MATE</italic> gene could contribute to anion efflux (see Introduction). The variation may also be related to the instability of the primary triticale lines which can continue in subsequent generations (Ma and Gustafson, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kalinka and Achrem, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The grain used in these experiments were bulked on two occasions so some variation was not unexpected. However each experiment was performed several times and the results presented here reflect the same general trends. Future studies could, nevertheless, quantify the stability of the triticale lines by determining the chromosome number of individual plants within each line and in different generations. The expression levels of target genes could also be measured and Al-resistance assessed in field trials on acidic and limed soils over several sites and seasons. These experiments would provide further insight into the genetic stability of the primary triticale material.</p><p>Triticale was developed to combine the favorable attributes of rye and wheat and to generate diversity. The triticale material used in this study were primary triticale lines generated by crossing rye pollen to female wheat plants. The reverse cross (rye as the female parent) is possible but less successful. Nevertheless, since the mitochondrial and plastid genomes are maternally inherited some traits are under cytoplasmic control (Thiede, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Battich et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Additional diversity might be generated if improved technologies enabled the reverse crosses to occur more efficiently so that the origins of the mitochondrial and plastid genomes in triticale would be rye instead of wheat.</p><p>Most triticale grown around the world are hexaploid types because they tend to show better vigor and stability (Mergoum et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The present study found that the strong Al-resistance of rye was not fully expressed in either the hexaploid or octoploid triticale whereas the Al-resistance traits derived from Carazinho hexaploid wheat did transfer to octoploid triticale more successfully. If this pattern is indicative of other phenotypes then hexaploid triticale is potentially missing other valuable traits that may occur in some hexaploid wheat but not tetraploid wheat. Consideration should be given to developing cytological techniques that improve the genetic stability of octoploid triticale so that beneficial traits of hexaploid wheat (e.g., flour quality, nutrient content) can be captured in the hybrid. Such an approach could further improve the value of triticale production.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>WH and PR conceived the project and coordinated with the breeder to access the germplasm.
