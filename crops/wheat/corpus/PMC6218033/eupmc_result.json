    "Interspecific hybridization between bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 42) and related species allows the transfer of agronomic and quality traits, whereby subsequent generations comprise an improved genetic background and can be directly applied in wheat breeding programmes. While wild relatives are frequently used as sources of agronomically favourable traits, cultivated species can also improve wheat quality and stress resistance. A salt-tolerant 'Asakaze'/'Manas' 7H disomic addition line (2n = 44) with elevated β-glucan content, but with low fertility and an unstable genetic background was developed in an earlier wheat-barley prebreeding programme. The aim of the present study was to take this hybridization programme further and transfer the favourable barley traits into a more stable genetic background. Taking advantage of the breakage-fusion mechanism of univalent chromosomes, the 'Rannaya' winter wheat 7B monosomic line was used as female partner to the 7H addition line male, leading to the development of a compensating wheat/barley Robertsonian translocation line (7BS.7HL centric fusion, 2n = 42) exhibiting higher salt tolerance and elevated grain β-glucan content. Throughout the crossing programme, comprising the F1-F4 generations, genomic in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome-specific molecular markers were used to trace and identify the wheat and barley chromatin. Investigations on salt tolerance during germination and on the (1,3;1,4)-β-D-glucan (mixed-linkage glucan [MLG]) content of the seeds confirmed the salt tolerance and elevated grain MLG content of the translocation line, which can be directly applied in current wheat breeding programmes."
