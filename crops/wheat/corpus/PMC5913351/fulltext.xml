Seaweed polysaccharides have been shown to promote crop growth and improve the resistance of plant to abiotic stresses. <italic>Pyropia yezoensis</italic> is a commercially important edible red alga in Southeast Asia. However, there is little research on the application of polysaccharides from <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> in agriculture. The molecular weight (MW) of polysaccharides influences their properties. Therefore, in this study, four representative polysaccharides from <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> (PP) with different MWs (MW: 3.2, 10.5, 29.0, and 48.8 kDa) were prepared by microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. The relationship between the degradation of polysaccharides from <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> (DPP) and their effects on plant salt tolerance was investigated. The results showed that exogenous PP and DPPs increased wheat seedling shoot and root lengths, and fresh and dry weights, alleviated membrane lipid peroxidation, increased the chlorophyll content and enhanced antioxidant activities. The expression level examination analysis of several Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter genes suggested that DPPs could protect plants from the damage of salt stress by coordinating the efflux and compartmentation of Na<sup>+</sup>. The results demonstrated that polysaccharides could regulate antioxidant enzyme activities and modulate intracellular ion concentration, thereby to protect plants from salt stress damage. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the tolerance of wheat seedlings to salt stress and MW of polysaccharides. The results suggested that the lower-MW samples (DPP1, 3.2 kDa) most effectively protect wheat seedlings against salt stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Pyropia yezoensis</italic></kwd><kwd>polysaccharides</kwd><kwd>molecular weight</kwd><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>antioxidant enzyme activities</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Soil salinization is a major concern in agriculture. It is estimated that by 2050, salinization will degrade up to 30% of all cultivated land (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Van Oosten et al., 2017</xref>). High salinity is a major abiotic stress factor that restricts crop growth and yield worldwide. Salinity reduces photosynthesis, plant growth and development in plants by causing osmotic stress, ion injury or oxidative stress (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Rivero et al., 2014</xref>). Plants have developed several comprehensive mechanisms to tolerate or overcome the effects of salinity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bose et al., 2014</xref>). The application of exogenous biostimulators may effectively protect plants against salinity.</p><p><italic>Pyropia yezoensis</italic> is a commercially important edible red alga in Southeast Asia. It is cultivated and consumed in China, Japan, and South Korea. The chemical structure of <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> polysaccharides was investigated by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2012)</xref>. It has a backbone of alternating (1 &#x02192; 4) -3,6-anhydro-&#x003b1;-<sc>L</sc>-galactopyranose units and (1 &#x02192; 3) - linked &#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-galactose or (1 &#x02192; 4)-linked &#x003b1;-<sc>L</sc>-galactose 6-sulfate units. In recent years, <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> polysaccharides have attracted attention as biomedical material because of their and antioxidants (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), anticancer (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), hypolipidemic (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2014</xref>), immunoregulatory (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), the neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mohibbullah et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that polysaccharides carrageenans and their oligosaccharides can trigger defense systems against plant pathogens including bacteria, virus and fungi (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Stadnik and de Freitas, 2014</xref>). <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sangha et al. (2010)</xref> found that &#x003bb;-carrageenan can activate defense mechanisms of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.)

(2012)</xref> demonstrated the application of &#x003ba;-, &#x003b9;-, and &#x003bb;-oligo-carrageenans resulted in a durable protection against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> Persoon and <italic>Pectobacterium carotovorum</italic> (Jones) Waldee.</p><p>The activities of polysaccharides depend on the molecular weight (MW), the number of sulfate groups and the molar ratio of sulfate/total sugar. The MW of polysaccharides influences their physicochemical behavior. It may be difficult for high-MW crude polysaccharides to permeate the basement membrane and exert its effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, a low-MW polysaccharide prepared from <italic>Laminaria japonica</italic> has effective scavenging activities on superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and hypochlorous acid <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zha et al., 2016</xref>). Zhou&#x02019;s work indicated that the ultrasonic degraded polysaccharide from <italic>Porphyra yezoensis</italic> exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than that of the natural polysaccharide (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). These results indicate that polysaccharide antioxidant activity may be inversely proportional to MW. The aim of this paper was to study the relationship between MW of polysaccharides from <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> and their activities of improving plant&#x02019;s tolerance to salt stress. Therefore, the polysaccharides were partially degraded in the aqueous phase with the assistance of microwaves. Then the effects of four degraded and natural polysaccharides on wheat seedlings under salt stress were investigated. These polysaccharides may represent a potentially simple, efficacious, and sustainable approach for inhibiting the harm to commercially important crops caused by abiotic stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and Equipments</title><p>In February 2017, <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> individuals were collected from a farming raft in Rizhao, Shandong Province, China.

The results showed that gs significantly reduced under salt stress (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>), which was caused by an excessive accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> ion in the guard cells.

In this work, salt-stressed wheat seedlings had a 30.8% reduction in Pn compared with control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which is in accord with previous findings (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2015</xref>).

Proline not only occupies a compatible osmolyte and osmoprotectant under abiotic stresses, it also regulates osmotic potential, stabilizes cellular structure, and reduces damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Zhang Z. et al. (2017)</xref> indicated that proline metabolic pathways exhibit significant differences during the salt stress response. Proline induces the expression of salt stress-responsive proteins, consequently increases the adaptation of plant to salt stress. The protective effect of proline may be explained by its ability to induce antioxidant enzymes to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). There was a report that exogenous proline alleviated the oxidative damage by reducing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lipid peroxidation levels and by increasing antioxidant activity (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ben Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>). The results of the present study showed that salt stress induced proline biosynthesis in salt-stressed plants to resist the osmotic imbalance caused by salt stress. This may be a stress reaction for plant to salt stress. PPs further increased the proline content in salt-stressed wheat seedlings in order to counteract the salt-induced osmotic stress. Most of all, the proline content in DPP1 group was obviously higher than that of other groups, indicated that the wheat seedlings of DPP1 group had stronger osmotic regulation ability.</p></sec><sec><title>Antioxidant Enzymes Activities</title><p>The results showed that soluble protein content decreased after 10 days salt stress.

The latter is also toxic and must be eliminated by the concerted actions of CAT and POD. In the present study, salt stress induced SOD, POD, and CAT activities to levels significantly greater than those of the control. Plants receiving PPs under NaCl stress also showed relative increases in their SOD, POD, and CAT activities. The results indicated that PPs effectively induce ROS scavenging in wheat seedlings by modulating their antioxidant enzymes activities. Therefore, PPs may enhance defense responses in plants under salt stress. In general, DPP1 (3.2 kDa) was significantly more effective at inducing antioxidant activity and ROS scavenging than the other PP and DPPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> Accumulation in Different Tissues of Wheat Seedlings</title><p>The results showed that Na<sup>+</sup> content increased highly in different tissues of wheat seedlings after 10 days salt stress.

The Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1), a plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> antiporter mediates cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> efflux at the root and regulates Na<sup>+</sup> transportation from root to shoot thereby maintaining appropriated K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in leaves, where the photosynthesis take place (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2002</xref>).

This physical property may limit its practical application in agriculture, pharmaceutical, and other industries. Many studies demonstrated that polysaccharide MW distributions significantly influence their biological functions. Polysaccharides with relatively lower MWs have been reported to have higher antioxidant effects than those with higher MWs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zha et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2013)</xref> prepared six representative sulphated polysaccharides (446.5, 247.0, 76.1, 19.0, 5.0, and 3.1 kDa) using the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis method and investigated their antioxidant activities. Samples with high MW inhibited superoxide radicals more effectively than did lower-MW polysaccharides. In contrast, samples with low MW more effectively inhibited hydroxyl radicals than those with higher MW. Nevertheless, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hou et al. (2012)</xref> reported that the relationship between the MW of fucoidans (1.0, 3.8, 8.3, 13.2, 35.5, 64.3, and 144.5 kDa) and their antioxidant activities is non-linear. The 3.8, 1.0, and &#x0003e;8.3 kDa samples had relatively superior hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and superoxide anion scavenging activity, respectively.</p><p>Sulfate content significantly influences the superoxide anion scavenging ability of fucoidans (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Rocha de Souza et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, all the samples had similar sulfate levels, so this factor could be ignored. The results suggest that lower-MW samples (DPP1, 3.2 kDa) are the most effective at protecting wheat seedlings against salt stress. The close correlation between the activity and the MW of polysaccharides reveals that the former is dependent on a specific chemical structure. Polysaccharides with different MW may form different configurations that interact with elicitor receptors on plant cell membranes. Polysaccharides that are too small or large are often inactive. The appropriate degree of polymerization will effectively induce a regulatory response. The capacity of functional oligosaccharides produced by alginase was studied on the growth promoting of <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> L. under salt stress. The plant growth experiment suggested that low MW oligosaccharides were more effective in stimulating root elongation and relieving salt stress (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). Seven chitooligomers (COSs) with determined degrees of polymerization (chitotetraose to chitooctaose, DP 8&#x02013;10, DP 10&#x02013;12) were applied to explore the relationship between the degrees of polymerization of COSs and its effect on the tolerance of wheat seedlings to salt stress. The results suggested that chitohexaose, chitoheptaose, and chitooctaose exhibited stronger activity compared with other COS samples, which suggested that its activity had a closely relationship with its degrees of polymerization (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang X. et al., 2017</xref>). Ulteriorly, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2009)</xref> investigated the effects of chitooligomers (COS) COS5 and COS6 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> on the expression of the gene coding for the CR3 cell surface receptor. The results showed that both COS5 and COS6 promote the expression of CR3 mRNA, and this effect was stronger in response to COS6 than COS5. Both of these activated phagocytes and enhanced antibody transmission by binding to the CR3 receptor. COS6 has a higher MW and more exposed amino glucose groups than COS5. Consequently, relative to COS5, COS6 has more active binding sites available to combine with the CR3 receptor surfaces of macrophages and lymphocytes. What is more, COS6 can change the configuration of the CR3 receptor and increase its substrate affinity. The function of these plasma membrane proteins is related to the perception of the elicitor signal. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying elicitor recognition, including polysaccharides and signal transduction, require further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study developed an efficient method for the degradation of <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> polysaccharide using microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. Microwave exposures significantly accelerated the reaction rate. Polysaccharides with different MW could be obtained by strictly controlling the reaction conditions. Representative polysaccharides with different MW (3.2, 10.5, 29.0, and 48.8 kDa) were prepared and the relationship between their MW and their effects on plant salt tolerance was investigated. The results showed that degradation of <italic>P. yezoensis</italic> polysaccharide could protect plants from salt stress damage by regulating antioxidant enzyme activities and the content of permeable substances. The expression level examination analysis of several Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter genes indicated that DPPs could restrict the transport and accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in the wheat seedlings, maintain a higher K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, thereby protect plants from the damage of salt stress. Furthermore, the effect of polysaccharides on the tolerance of wheat seedlings to salt stress was closely correlated with polysaccharide MW.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PZ: Conceived the study and wrote the manuscript.
