The dewetting behavior, which can be either before or after initial CuCl<sub>2</sub> nucleation, depends on the amount of CuCl&#x02082; and BSA in the Petri dish. We postulate that the concentration and/or temperature gradient area in the dish, which is built up during the evaporation process, coincides with the location where dewetting predominantly starts. This hypothesis could be supported by measurements of the CuCl<sub>2</sub> coverage of the Petri dish. During the evaporation the height of the meniscus at the rim of the Petri dish recedes in favor of the central Petri dish area. This could not be explained by the above mentioned hypothesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Molecular physics</kwd><kwd>Condensed matter physics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The method of <underline>d</underline>ihydrate <underline>c</underline>upric <underline>c</underline>hloride with additives (shortly DCC crystallization method) comprises the evaporation and crystallization of DCC in the presence of an additive (the sample), resulting in additive-specific DCC patterns.

Dewetting occurs either before or after initial nucleation when during the evaporation phase the fluid layer thins to such an extent that the surface tension force exceeds the gravitational force. In the case of dewetting before initial nucleation, the dewetting process confines all the DCC to the rim of the glass-plate. Below a DCC amount of 600 mg/plate the probability of dewetting before crystallization increases proportionally.</p><p id="p0075">Dewetting after crystallization can directly be observed from the time-laps stills documenting the evaporation/crystallization process at 600 mg DCC, because the contrast at this DCC concentration is high enough to distinguish between loss and retainment of integrity of the fluid film. The process of this type of dewetting can be described as follows (See also chapter 1.3 of the supplementary information): first, upon initial nucleation, the crystals start growing from a location near the geometrical center of the plate. During the growth of the crystals the intact fluid film is still visible on the time laps photos. When the primary crystal covers roughly 60 %&#x02013;80 % of the dish surface, a solution free area appears, located between the centrally located primary crystal and the solution at the ring. Finally the solution at the ring starts crystallizing, culminating in two crystal areas separated by a crystal-free zone. This is visible in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> on the right. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> on the left an example is presented of dewetting before crystallization.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>R2 Dewetting before crystallization is inhibited by 1&#x02013;3 monolayers of BSA</title><p id="p0080">The hypothesis from Gallinet <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> was tested, which states that a minimum of one monolayer of BSA influences the dewetting behavior of a DCC solution. Hereto mixtures of varying amounts of DCC with BSA as additive were crystallized. For the evaluation of the dewetting process the same criteria as in <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> were used; either there is (1) dewetting before crystallization or there is (2) crystallization with or without dewetting during crystal growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> right).

Similarly this transition was observed for a BSA amount of about one to three calculated monolayers. Which is in good agreement with the hypothesis from Gallinet <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the estimation of the BSA losses due to adsorption onto the used glassware.

Overtension is defined by the ratio of hcrit and hsol. Hcrit is the critical height where the surface tension and the gravity forces of the solution are in balance. Hsol is the height of the solution in the Petri dish at which the DCC solubility border is reached. Hsol is proportional to the DCC amount, hcrit is calculated according to <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> (see supplementary information chapter 1.3 table SI.1 for the formulas and the calculation results). Hypothesis H1 is in agreement with that postulated by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, who connected dewetting to the height of the solution falling below Hcrit, creating a meta-stable situation.

In this case, according to prediction <xref rid="enun4" ref-type="statement">H1.3</xref> the onset of dewetting is expected to be more independent of the gradient level. Consequently dewetting should initiate on average closer to the geometric center. This was not evaluated by a direct observation. But it was possible to be evaluated by the radius of the DCC crystal coverage in result R3. The coverage of the plate in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref> jumps from 1-3 monolayers of BSA from a radius of 60 % to a radius of 90 % (for 100 mg DCC per plate).

No DCC at the ring, DCC only found around the geometric center</title><p id="p0185">For DCC amounts lower than 31 mg plate and for BSA amounts &#x0003e; three calculated monolayers the amount of DCC at the rim in % of the total amount of DCC is decreasing in response to decreasing DCC amounts. This implies that the amount of solution in the meniscus at the ring is decreasing during the evaporation. This is quit unexpected. To approach the problem the situation during the evaporation is described in detail.</p><p id="p0190">During the evaporation the height of the solution decreases. We expect that the meniscus will follow the receding surface height of the solution. Firstly by a decrease of the contact angle to the receding angle, and secondly by following the surface height whilst maintaining the meniscus volume. The evaporation rate at the meniscus is lower than in the middle of the dish due to the shielding of the rim [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore the meniscus volume is expected to be less affected by the evaporation than the area around the geometric center, ruling the evaporation out as the reason for a decrease of the meniscus.</p><p id="p0195">For all used DCC amounts the starting volume is 6 ml and the profile of the solution over the Petri dish is roughly the same at the start of the evaporation. The volume- and thus the height of the solution when reaching the DCC solubility border is decreasing with the DCC amount, which results in different profiles of the solution at the same solubility border for different DCC starting amounts.</p><p id="p0200">In <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> the surface temperature of the solution was measured in the dish during the evaporation. The measurements for 60 mg and 600 mg DCC show after 10 hours of evaporation (1&#x02013;2 hours before the start of the crystallization) a strong difference in the temperature gradient. In the case of 600 mg DCC per plate the temperature gradient was zero while for 60 mg DCC per plate the gradient was as strong as at the begin of the evaporation. The concentration gradient is still existing for 60 and for 600 mg DCC after 10 hours of evaporation <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. When calculating the influence of the concentration- and the temperature-gradient on the surface tension gradient both have the same direction. A lower concentration (towards the rim) results in a lower surface tension. A higher temperature towards the rim (less evaporation) results in a lower surface tension. So both effects would increase the surface tension gradient as a trigger for dewetting.</p><p id="p0205">With a higher overtension as a consequence of the lower DCC amount and a higher surface tension gradient towards the rim the location of the onset of dewetting should be more towards the geometric center (lower in % radius), which is in accordance with R4. This effect does however not explain why the volume of the meniscus is reducing. The % radius data points for the DCC amounts below 31 mg per plate are below the regression line in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> (R4), which would fit with the above argumentation of a higher gradient due to the temperature gradient at low DCC amounts and the additional trigger by the crystallization wave, as was predicted in <xref rid="enun4" ref-type="statement">H1.3</xref>.</p><p id="p0210">The reduction of the meniscus is a stepwise effect (R6) which points to an unknown factor in the process of dewetting by crystallization in the presence of gradients.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><label>4.5</label><title>Summary of the discussion</title><p id="p0215">For the hypothesis postulated in this article that dewetting is triggered by crystallization in an area with a concentration and a temperature gradient, three supporting and one thus far unexplained observations were found:<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0220">When adding BSA to a DCC solution, which subsequently lowers the degree of overtension, an increase in the radius of the DCC crystal coverage is found.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0225">When increasing the DCC amount of the solution (in the presence of BSA), which lowers the overtension, an increase in the radius of the DCC crystal coverage is found.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p id="p0230">When increasing the overtension of the solution (decreasing the DCC amount in the presence of BSA), the radius of the DCC crystal coverage of the plate is reduced.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0025"><label>4.</label><p id="p0235">However, for DCC amounts below 31 mg the decreasing DCC at the ring could not be explained by this hypothesis.

Based on the work from other authors [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a hypothesis could be formulated. The hypothesis postulates that the overtension (unbalance of surface and gravity forces in the solution) triggers dewetting in an area where gradients of concentration or temperature exist. Crystallization amplifies the triggers. In support of the hypothesis three observations were found. One observation (the procentual reduction of DCC at the rim of the Petri dish) could not be explained and needs further research, because it seems to point to a hidden factor in the forces dealing with the dewetting in a Petri dish under the above described conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0245">Nicolaas Busscher: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0250">Paul Doesburg, Gaby Mergardt, Anezka Sokol: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0255">Johannes Kahl: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0260">Angelika Ploeger: Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0265">This work was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">Software AG Stiftung</funding-source> (Darmstadt/Germany) for funding the projects 10447 and 10986.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0270">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0275">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>J.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Henriksen</surname><given-names>C.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Laursen</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>A.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Computerised image analysis of biocrystallograms originating from agricultural products</article-title><source>Comput.
