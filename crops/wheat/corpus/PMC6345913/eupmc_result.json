    "Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the main diseases affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum) production worldwide. Calmodulin (CaM) was found involved in the early stage of signal transduction pathway in response to P. triticina in wheat. To study the function and molecular mechanism of calmodulin (CaM) in signal transduction of wheat against P. triticina, we cloned a putative calmodulin-binding transcription activator (TaCAMTA4), and characterized its molecular structure and functions by using the CaM-encoding gene (TaCaM4-1) as a bait to screen the cDNA library from P. triticina infected wheat leaves. The open reading frame of TaCAMTA4 was 2505â€‰bp encoding a protein of 834 aa, which contained all the four conserved domains of family (CG-1 domain, TIG domain, ANK repeats and CaM-binding domain). TaCaM4-1 bound to TaCAMTA4 by the C-terminal CaM-binding domain in Ca2+-dependent manner in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis indicated that the interaction of TaCAMTA4 and TaCaM4-1 took place in the cytoplasm and nucleus of epidermal leaf cells in N. benthamiana. The expression level of TaCAMTA4 genes was down-regulated in incompatible combination after P. triticina infection. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-based knockdown of TaCAMTA4 and disease assays verified that silencing of TaCAMTA4 resulted in enhanced resistance to P. triticina race 165. These results suggested that TaCAMTA4 function as negative regulator of defense response against P. triticina."
