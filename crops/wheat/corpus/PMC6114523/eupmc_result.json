    "Dasypyrum villosum has been used as a valuable gene resource for disease resistances, yield increase and quality improvement in wheat. A novel wheat-D. villosum alien introgression line CD-3 was generated through hybridization between the common wheat Chinese Spring (CS) and a CS- D. villosum 3V addition line having considerably high stripe rust resistance, which enable the characterization of a potential new stripe rust resistance gene (s) derived from D. villosum. The results of non-denaturing fluorescent in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) showed that CD-3 contained 42 chromosomes, including a 3V chromosome pair, and the absence of both of the 3D chromosomes. PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) molecular marker analysis supported results from the FISH analysis, revealing CD-3 was a wheat-D. villosum 3V (3D) disomic substitution line. Resistant test of stripe rust on 52 plants of F2 generation (CD-3/CS), CD-3, CS and D.villosum have been conducted at seedling stage. 7 plants of F2 generation possessing two 3V chromosomes exhibited high resistance to stripe rust as CD-3 and D.villosum, 10 plants carrying one 3V chromosome and 35 plants without 3V chromosome were susceptive to stripe rust as CS. The result implied the high stripe rust resistance of CD-3 should be controlled by recessive gene(s) originating from D.villosum. To rapidly detect chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat, we developed a novel Sequence Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) marker specific for 3V chromosome based on the sequence of a grain size-related gene DvGS5 in D. villosum, an orthologue of TaGS5 from wheat. The SCAR marker was designated DvGS5-1443, which could successfully amplify a unique 3V-specific fragment in CD-3 and D. villosum, suggesting that this SCAR marker could facilitate targeting the chromosome 3V in the genetic background of wheat for wheat improvement."
