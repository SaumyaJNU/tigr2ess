Some of such models for deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat, using two different modelling techniques, have been published. This study aimed to compare and cross-validate three different modelling approaches for predicting DON in winter wheat using data from the Netherlands as a case study. To this end, a published empirical model was updated with a new mixed effect logistic regression method. A mechanistic model for wheat in Italy was adapted to the Dutch situation. A new Bayesian network model was developed to predict DON in wheat. In developing the three models, the same dataset was used, including agronomic and weather data, as well as DON concentrations of individual samples in the Netherlands over the years 2001&#x02013;2013 (625 records). Similar data from 2015 and 2016 (86 records) were used for external independent validation. The results showed that all three modelling approaches provided good accuracy in predicting DON in wheat in the Netherlands. The empirical model showed the highest accuracy (88%). However, this model is highly location and data-dependent, and can only be run if all of the input data are available. The mechanistic model provided 80% accuracy. This model is easier to implement in new areas given similar mycotoxin-producing fungal populations. The Bayesian network model provided 86% accuracy. Compared with the other two models, this model is easier to implement when input data are incomplete. In future research, the three modelling approaches could be integrated to even better support decision-making in mycotoxin management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DON</kwd><kwd>cereal grains</kwd><kwd>food safety</kwd><kwd>forecast</kwd><kwd>mycotoxin</kwd><kwd>validation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Key Contribution"><title>Key Contribution</title><p>Cross-validation of the three modelling techniques was done to further understand the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, and contribute to future research and progress in the prediction of mycotoxin contamination in food and feed.

Introduction</title><p>Mycotoxin contamination in cereals has been recognised as a global threat for human and animal health, especially under the pressure of climate change [<xref rid="B1-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. (mainly <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium culmorum</italic>) is one of the most studied and frequently occurring mycotoxin in winter wheat globally. Contamination of wheat with <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. and DON is influenced by the wheat variety, agronomic practices (e.g., tillage), and local weather, especially around wheat flowering. Monitoring and predictive modelling have become some of the solutions for farmers, collectors, and food safety authorities to manage mycotoxin contamination during cereal cultivation and beyond. Some predictive models for mycotoxins have been developed and implemented in agricultural sectors in Europe as decision support systems for farmers [<xref rid="B2-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These models have been developed by either an empirical or mechanistic modelling approach. In the past five years, models have been updated with recent monitoring data, and modelling techniques have been improved. For example, machine learning algorithms have recently been introduced in food safety areas [<xref rid="B9-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Machine learning explores the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Such algorithms can learn from sample inputs and make data-driven predictions or decisions [<xref rid="B11-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Bayesian network (BN) modelling is one of many machine learning algorithms, and can possibly also be used to predict mycotoxin contamination in cereals. </p><p>Logistic regression is a classic method to estimate the parameters of a logistic model, in which the log-odds of the probability of a binary event (e.g., presence or absence of mycotoxins) is a linear combination of independent variables [<xref rid="B12-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Logistic regression is used in various areas, such as in medicines, social sciences, and life sciences. Mixed effects models contain both fixed effects (variables in the regression model) and random effects. With a hierarchical structure in the data (e.g., with repeated sampling in the same year/at the same farm), such a mixed model with random effects can improve the prediction accuracy.</p><p>A BN model is a probabilistic model that is based on Bayesian statistics and decision theory in combination with graph theory [<xref rid="B13-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is a directed graphical model that represents conditional probabilities among a set of variables, based on the application of the Bayes&#x02019; theorem. Compared to linear regression models, BN models can more easily analyze dependencies between variables, manage non-linear interaction, and combine different sorts of information, such as measurement data, expert knowledge, and end-user feedback [<xref rid="B15-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p><p>Mechanistic models simulate the fundamental mechanisms of plant and fungus development stages and their interactions. Such models require well-developed knowledge of each biological process, as well as extensive experimental research under a wide range of conditions to collect the required knowledge and input data. </p><p>This study aimed to compare and cross-validate three different modelling approaches, i.e., the empirical, BN, and mechanistic approach, for predicting DON contamination in winter wheat using data from the Netherlands as a case study. These models aim to support decision-making by farmers regarding limiting mycotoxin contamination by optimizing their agricultural management practices, such as fungicide sprays and harvest time. Grain collectors can also use the model predictions to buy wheat from low-risk areas in advance, or to optimize sampling plans for mycotoxin analysis. Food safety authorities can use the model predictions to locate high-risk areas for a more targeted and cost-efficient mycotoxin monitoring. Cross-validation of the three modelling techniques was done to further understand the pros and cons of each technique, and contribute to future research and progress in the prediction of mycotoxin contamination in food and feed. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxins-10-00267"><title>2.

In this BN model, DONclass is the parent of all of the other variables. The flowering date (FD) variable is called the child of DONclass if the link goes from DONclass to FD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00267-f003">Figure 3</xref>).

Discussion and Conclusions </title><p>This study compared the performances of three modelling approaches for predicting DON contamination in winter wheat by using Dutch data as a case study. Two of these models (the regression-based and the BN models) are new, while the third model (the mechanistic model) was adapted (included in a DFA) for being used with Dutch data. These models have been calibrated with the same dataset collected between 2001&#x02013;2013 in the Netherlands, and cross-validated with another dataset collected in 2015 and 2016 in the Netherlands. From this exercise, the pro and cons of three modelling approaches are summarized, and results are discussed (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>).</p><p>Logistic regression is a classic and well-studied modelling approach that is applied in many research fields, including the food safety area. In this study, an evolution of a previously published empirical model [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is presented. The updated model uses mixed effect logistic regression with recent field data, and predicts DON contamination classes instead of concentrations. Out of the three considered modelling approaches, mixed effect logistic regression models had the highest accuracy for low DON contamination, but not for medium and high contaminations. This method shows the statistical relationship between independent variables and the response variable collected in a specific agricultural context, which is the Dutch wheat-growing areas, in this case. Therefore, this method is highly data-dependent (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>), which implies that the regression parameter estimates cannot be used for other agricultural conditions than represented with the data used in model development, before proper validation. In addition, the model cannot be run in cases where data on one of the input variables (e.g., the resistance level of the variety) is missing. This implies that with the current models, predictions can only start from one week before FD (with using 10 days of weather forecast data). </p><p>In this study, a new Bayesian network model to predict DON contamination at harvest in winter wheat has been developed. The BN model predicted all of the cases in the low DON contamination class, and had an accuracy of 94.3%. Similar to the regression models, the BN model was not able to correctly predict any of the DON contamination cases in the medium or high class from the validation dataset. The structure of the BN enables the model developer to easily add new information and/or expert knowledge in the model. BN models can use a combination of statistical relationships and expert knowledge (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). The BN model is flexible, and can predict DON contamination even when only one variable is available. For instance, the BN model can calculate a base risk using GArea and ResisL at the beginning of the growing season. With these two variables, the BN model correctly predicted 81.6% of the cases (70 cases in the low class and one case in the high class) (data not shown). This largely extends the prediction possibilities to the start of the growing season. In this study, the BN model included all of the variables used in the regression models, in order to compare the two modelling approaches based on the same variables. In future studies, the best set of variables will be selected for the BN only.</p><p>The mechanistic model of Rossi et al. [<xref rid="B16-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was included in the DFA in order to classify DON contamination of winter wheat in the Netherlands. Similar to the other models, the mechanistic model and DFA were not able to correctly predict any DON contamination cases in the medium class, but the model predicted correctly one of the two cases in the high DON class. </p><p>In summary, all three modelling approaches have good prediction accuracy in forecasting low DON contamination in winter wheat in the Netherlands, and are suitable for providing decision support to farmers and collectors. In the present work, the three modelling approaches were developed and tested using data mostly composed by cases in the &#x02018;low&#x02019; class of DON contamination. Further validation is needed to confirm the accuracy of the model predictions in cases in which DON contamination is higher and close to the European Union (EU) legal limit. </p><p>Implementing a mycotoxin forecasting model that has been developed for certain conditions, such as for one wheat-growing area or country, to other conditions as represented in the data used for model development, should always be done with utmost care and proper model testing and validation. From the experiences gained in our study, it was shown that the three modelling approaches each have their own advantages and disadvantages (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>).</p><p>Regression-based models and BN models are empirical. Being developed and parameterised based on a specific dataset, they represent the mathematical relationships among that data or similar conditions only. Therefore, empirical models should only be used for those conditions, such as the area/country, as represented by the observational data used for model development. Thus, these models are unsuitable to predict situations that did not occur in the model development dataset (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>), such as extreme weather events due to climate change or new agricultural practices (e.g., increase of conservation tillage or diffusion of new crop rotation types, which both affect the Fusarium head blight, or FHB, inoculum availability). BN models can include expert&#x02019;s knowledge, and are very flexible regarding add new information to the forecasting system. In addition, BN models can produce output with incomplete information on the model&#x02019;s input variables, even though this may lead to a reduction in the accuracy of their outputs. </p><p>The mechanistic model, by definition, simulates the biological processes, which are in this case fungal infection, growth, and mycotoxin production. Such process-based models are not highly location-dependent, and are thus much easier to implement in other countries (<xref rid="toxins-10-00267-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). However, the mechanistic model has rather high requirements for data availability, and runs with specific types of data, such as heading date and leaf wetness duration, which are not always available. Furthermore, spatial differences on fungal species still need to be considered when implementing a mechanistic model in different wheat-growing areas. For instance, the frequency of <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. and mycotoxigenic strains within species differs between North/Central Europe and South Europe [<xref rid="B18-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to the low presence of <italic>F. culmorum</italic> in winter wheat grown in the Netherlands [<xref rid="B19-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], only <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was considered in the current mechanistic model for the Netherlands, whereas both <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. culmorum</italic> were considered in the Italian model. </p><p>Since all of the different modelling approaches have both pro and cons, a modelling ensemble in which different model types are combined could be interesting solution. Constructing such a modelling ensemble is part of the EC-funded MyToolBox project [<xref rid="B20-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It will integrate the models in a unique framework and strengthen their advantages to provide more timely and accurate advice, in order to limit mycotoxin contamination and improve the safety of cereals and derived feed and food commodities. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-10-00267"><title>4.

At RIKILT, DON was extracted and quantified using a liquid-chromatography with double in-line mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [<xref rid="B21-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The limit of quantification (LOQ) varied over the years from 5 &#x000b5;g/kg to 100 &#x000b5;g/kg. The highest LOQ was therefore used in further data analysis, and samples with DON concentrations below this LOQ were assigned the value of 100 &#x000b5;g/kg.</p><p>Observed FD and observed HD of the wheat field was not always recorded by the farmer. Therefore, the FD and HD of all of the winter wheat fields were calculated based on the sum of the daily average temperatures above 0 &#x000b0;C, using the method described in Van der Fels-Klerx et al. [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. </p><p>The variable GArea was used in the models to test the influence of the farm&#x02019;s geographical location on the DON concentrations. GArea was calculated using geostatistical spatial analysis Kriging in ArcMap version 10.4.1 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) [<xref rid="B22-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Standardized DON concentrations ((DON value &#x02212; average)/standard deviation) were used in the calculation [<xref rid="B5-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using kriging interpolation, seven standardized DON classes were calculated from low to high. GArea was then defined as seven cultivation areas in the Netherlands with a proneness or potential probability of DON contamination in wheat, which were further grouped into three classes (standardized DON values &#x02264;0.08, 0.08&#x02013;2, &#x0003e;2) as in Rossi et al. (2007) for model comparison. With this calculation, the GArea class at any unknown location was obtained as a weighted average of the standardized DON contamination in the neighborhood of the location.</p><p>The wheat-growing season was divided into seven time windows that were each one week in length, by using FD as day 0. Day 0 was defined as 1 pm on the previous day to 12 am on the current day. The weekly time windows started from 24 days prior to FD to four days after FD and one week around HD, and were defined as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>W0: FD &#x02212; 24 1 pm to FD &#x02212; 17 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W1: FD &#x02212; 17 1 pm to FD &#x02212; 10 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W2: FD &#x02212; 10 1 pm to FD &#x02212; 3 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W3: FD &#x02212; 3 1 pm to FD + 4 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W4: FD + 4 1 pm to FD + 11 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W5: FD + 11 1 pm to HD &#x02212; 3 12 am,</p></list-item><list-item><p>W6: HD &#x02212; 3 1 pm to HD + 4 12 am</p></list-item></list></p><p>Note that FD and HD were positioned in the middle of the time windows W3 and W6 to limit the influence of estimating FD and HD using growing degree days. All of the time windows consisted of seven days except for W5. The length of W5 (in days) varied between the wheat fields, because the time between FD and HD differed per location due to the differences in local weather. For each time window, the following weather variables were calculated:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Tavg: Average hourly temperature in the time window (&#x000b0;C)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tmin: Minimum hourly temperature in the time window (&#x000b0;C)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tmax: Maximum hourly temperature in the time window (&#x000b0;C)</p></list-item><list-item><p>P: Sum of the precipitation in the time window (mm)</p></list-item><list-item><p>RHh80: Number of hours that relative humidity was higher than 80% (hour)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Th25: Number of hours that temperature was higher than 25 &#x000b0;C (hour)</p></list-item></list></p><p>The regression model and the Bayesian network (BN) model were developed using R (version 3.3.2). The mechanistic model was developed using SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All of the models predicted the probability of DON concentrations at harvest in three classes (DONclass): low (&#x02264;500 &#x000b5;g/kg), medium (500 &#x000b5;g/kg to 1250 &#x000b5;g/kg), and high (&#x0003e;1250 &#x000b5;g/kg). </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-toxins-10-00267"><title>4.2. Mixed Effect Logistic Regression Model</title><p>The stepwise selection was performed combining significant (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.25) weather and agronomic variables to predict DON concentrations in winter wheat. Year was added as a random effect to the model to test whether it improved model performance, as assessed by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The farmers&#x02019; model (Model C) and the collectors&#x02019; model (Model D) were developed using weather variables till around the flowering period (W1&#x02013;W4) and the entire cultivation period (W1&#x02013;W6), respectively. </p><p>Mixed effect linear regression models were developed in three steps: univariate analysis, stepwise logistic regression, and adding random effects. All of the statistical tests were assessed for significance at the 95% confidence level (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), except for the univariate analysis (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.25). Univariate analysis was performed following the method detailed in Van der Fels-Klerx [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The resulting agronomic and weather variables were considered in the stepwise logistic regression analyses. Then, year was added as a random effect to the model, in order to explain yearly variation in DON concentrations without using year as a prediction variable. The AIC was used to compare and select the best-fitting model. FD and HD were centred and scaled (dividing the centred data by their standard deviations) in the mixed effect model to limit the large differences in the scales of parameters, especially with calculating standard deviations of fixed effects. The pre-crop and tillage variables were not included in the model, because more than two-thirds of the records had no information about pre-crop or tillage. </p><p>The final models calculated the probabilities of DON concentrations above 500 &#x000b5;g/kg as P1 and above 1250 &#x000b5;g/kg as P2. The probabilities of three DON classes were then calculated as: Low Class = 1 &#x02212; P1, Mid Class = P2 &#x02212; P1, and High Class = P2. The predicted class of each sample was finally defined as the class with the highest probability. </p><p>To assess the model performance, a 10-fold internal cross-validation was conducted. Data for model development (2001 to 2013) were randomly divided into 10 subsets of equal size, and nine subsets were used for training the model, while the 10<sup>th</sup> subset was used to test the model&#x02019;s performance. This process was repeated 10 times, every time with a different test subset. So, all of the records were used for both training and testing, and each record was used for validation once. The mean area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-toxins-10-00267"><title>4.3. Bayesian Network Model</title><p>BN model development consists of four steps: (1) define variables of interests (also called notes), (2) structure learning, (3) parameter learning to calculate conditional probability tables (CPTs) for each parameter, and (4) BN validation. In order to compare different modelling approaches, a BN model was developed using the same variables as in the mixed effect linear regression models. The machine learning technique &#x02018;Tree-Augmented Naive (TAN) Bayes&#x02019; learning algorithms was used to learn the BN model structure and compute the CPTs [<xref rid="B23-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The structure and parameter learning steps were performed using the R package &#x02018;bnlearn&#x02019; [<xref rid="B24-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Continuous weather variables were discretised into discrete variables with eight clusters (same number of levels for variable year) by equal interval width, in order to ease and optimise the computation in the &#x02018;bnlearn&#x02019; package. The validation step is detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot5-toxins-10-00267">Section 4.5</xref>.</p><p>In this setting, the relationships among all of the variables were constructed and indicated as directed edges.

Mechanistic Model</title><p>A mechanistic model for Fusarium head blight (FHB) and mycotoxin contamination, taking into account the effect of weather, was developed by Rossi et al. [<xref rid="B16-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] using the system analysis approach [<xref rid="B25-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

These studies were carried out under both controlled-environment and field conditions. As <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is the main species present in the Netherlands [<xref rid="B19-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the mechanistic model was adapted to consider this fungal species only.</p><p>The simplified relational diagram of the model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00267-f005">Figure 5</xref>. State variables (in rectangular boxes) represent the status of the pathogen at a given moment. The flow (arrows) from one state variable to another is regulated by rate variables (drawn as valves), and defined as the rate of change of the state variables in time as a function of driving variables, which are constants or parameters influencing these rate variables. Rates are regulated by mathematical equations describing the relationships between the rate and the (external) influencing weather and plant variables. Circles indicate variables influencing each rate, and are linked to valves by dotted arrows. The modelling steps are detailed in the original papers by Rossi et al.

The categorical variables for wheat variety resistance and growing area have been combined with the model output (FHB-tox) by discriminant function analysis (DFA). Briefly, the procedure automatically selected a function (F1) that is able to separate the three classes of DON contamination as much as possible [<xref rid="B27-toxins-10-00267" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. </p><p>In this study, a new DFA was carried out on the (model development) data of the 625 fields collected in years between 2001&#x02013;2013. DFA was used to determine the probability that each case belonged to each of the three DON contamination groups, determine group membership based on these probabilities, and obtain information on the effect of the discriminant variables on group membership. To determine group membership, the prior probability of group membership was set as proportional to the number of observations in each group (i.e., 0.78 for low, 0.13 for medium, and 0.09 for high DON contamination). For the effect of discriminant variables on group membership, the canonical coefficients (CCs) and standardised canonical coefficients (SCCs) were calculated. The magnitude of CCs and SCCs is an indicator of the weight of each variable in each of the discriminant functions. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-toxins-10-00267"><title>4.5.
