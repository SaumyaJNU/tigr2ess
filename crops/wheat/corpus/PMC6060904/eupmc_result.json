    "This study investigated the effect of groundnut protein concentrate inclusion on the quality of wheat flour. Wheat and groundnut concentrate flours were blended (%, w/w) at ratios 100:0, 95:5, 90:10, 85:15, and 80:20, with 100% wheat flour serving as the control sample. Subsequently, proximate composition, functional, and pasting properties of blends were determined using established methods. Protein content of the concentrate was 72.80%. Significant (p < .05) increase in protein content of the flour blends was recorded with increasing concentration of groundnut protein concentrate and decreasing concentration of wheat flour. Highest protein content of 28.87% was recorded in blend with 20% groundnut protein concentrate. Fat, ash, and crude fiber contents ranged from 1.93% to 8.84%, 0.70% to 1.13%, and 0.84% to 1.23%, respectively. Carbohydrate decreased significantly (p < .05) with increasing concentration of groundnut protein concentrate. Bulk density and swelling capacity of the flour blends reduced significantly (p < .05) with increasing level of groundnut protein concentrate flour while solubility index, water absorption, emulsion, and foaming capacities increased. Peak time, peak, trough, breakdown, final, and setback viscosities of the flour blends reduced with groundnut protein concentrate inclusion while the pasting temperature reduced. Overall, wheat/groundnut protein concentrate flour blends showed good functional and pasting properties."
