However, their potential impact on agro-ecosystem functioning still remains to be investigated. Here, we assessed the impact of CuO-NPs (0.1, 1, and 100 mg/kg dry soil) on soil microbial activities involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycles in five contrasting agricultural soils in a microcosm experiment over 90 days. Additionally, in a pot experiment, we evaluated the influence of plant presence on the toxicity of CuO-NPs on soil microbial activities. CuO-NPs caused significant reductions of the three microbial activities measured (denitrification, nitrification, and soil respiration) at 100 mg/kg dry soil, but the low concentrations (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) had limited effects. We observed that denitrification was the most sensitive microbial activity to CuO-NPs in most soil types, while soil respiration and nitrification were mainly impacted in coarse soils with low organic matter content. Additionally, large decreases in heterotrophic microbial activities were observed in soils planted with wheat, even at 1 mg/kg for soil substrate-induced respiration, indicating that plant presence did not mitigate or compensate CuO-NP toxicity for microorganisms. These two experiments show that CuO-NPs can have detrimental effects on microbial activities in soils with contrasting physicochemical properties and previously exposed to various agricultural practices. Moreover, we observed that the negative effects of CuO-NPs increased over time, indicating that short-term studies (hours, days) may underestimate the risks posed by these contaminants in soils.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metal-oxide nanomaterials</kwd><kwd>agro-ecosystem</kwd><kwd>microbial ecotoxicology</kwd><kwd>wheat</kwd><kwd>nitrification</kwd><kwd>denitrification</kwd><kwd>soil respiration</kwd><kwd>plant-microorganism interactions</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7730"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Copper nanoparticles are increasingly used in various commercial products, including agrochemicals, paints, semiconducting compounds, sensors, catalyzers, and antimicrobial products, which leads to their growing release into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Keller et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These emerging contaminants can make their way into soil through direct applications of nanofertilizers or nanopesticides containing copper nanoparticles or through biosolid amendments from wastewater treatment (Lazareva and Keller, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kah, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Hence, the high reactivity of copper nanomaterials and their established antimicrobial properties raise some concerns about the potential consequences on microbial processes driving soil fertility in agro-ecosystems.</p><p>Extensive research has been conducted in the past decade to assess the impact of several metal nanoparticles on soil microbial communities, especially silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (reviews by Simonin and Richaume, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; McKee and Filser, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) still remain poorly documented. To our knowledge, only four studies have examined CuO-NP, and these studies were conducted using unrealistic exposure conditions with high concentrations of CuO-NPs ranging from 100 mg/kg to 10 g/kg of soil (Ben-Moshe et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Rousk et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Frenk et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), compared to expected concentrations in soil in the &#x003bc;g/kg to low mg/kg range (Garner and Keller, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Additionally, these studies were performed on one or two model soils that presented predominantly sandy-loam texture. Like any other pollutant, CuO-NP toxicity and bioavailability is likely influenced by soil properties, such as organic matter, pH, texture or ionic strength, and the results obtained in one soil type should thus not be generalized to other soils (Cornelis et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Simonin et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For example, soil characteristics can influence the transformations of CuO-NPs through processes such as dissolution (Keller et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The ionic Cu form can be both highly toxic for soil microorganisms (at high concentrations) and an essential micronutrient for biological growth (at low concentrations, Arguello et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence, it is hard to predict in which soil types the impact of CuO-NPs would be the most adverse depending on the dissolution rates observed and if CuO-NPs or ionic Cu form would have the larger detrimental effects on soil function. More research needs to be performed to assess the effects of realistic concentrations of CuO-NPs on microbial functioning in soils exhibiting contrasting physicochemical properties.</p><p>Moreover, the reliable assessment of the impact of a contaminant on microbial communities in soil needs to consider the influence of plants, especially in the context of an agro-ecosystem where plant-microorganism interactions are intense (Philippot et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It is frequently reported that a stressor has no direct effect on microbial communities but that microbial processes are impacted through indirect effects driven by plants in the context of strong plant-soil feedbacks (Cantarel et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Simonin et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Pommier et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). For instance, plants can influence the fate and bioavailability of pollutants in soils through soil restructuration by the roots, changes in soil pH, and exudation of organic compounds (Bravin et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The presence of plants has also been shown to increase the immobilization and detoxification of Cu in soil (R&#x000f6;mkens et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Chibuike and Obiora, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A recent study showed that CuO-NPs exhibited slow dissolution rates in soils and that those rates were modulated by the wheat rhizosphere due to direct associations of CuO-NPs to roots, an increase in soil pH and the exudation of small organic acids (Gao et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Additionally, the input of nutrient resources through plant exudation can confer a higher resistance and resilience of microbial communities to disturbances (Griffiths and Philippot, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Microbial communities already stressed by low nutrient availability in bulk soils may have less energy available to cope with an external stressor like CuO-NPs in comparison to rhizosphere microbial communities inhabiting nutrient-rich habitats (de Vries and Shade, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Nevertheless, soil ecotoxicological assays on nanomaterials rarely include plants and are mainly performed over short periods of time (2 weeks to 1 month), ignoring the plant-soil feedbacks and indirect effects that can affect pollutant bioavailability and toxicity over long period of times (McKee and Filser, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Specific studies designed to assess how plants modulate NP toxicity for soil microorganisms are clearly needed.</p><p>In this study, we performed two experiments to address the following questions: (1) Do CuO-NPs affect microbial function in contrasting soils at relevant low concentrations? (2) Is plant presence influencing the microbial response to CuO-NP exposure? To address the first question, we performed a soil microcosm experiment over 90 days to assess the effects of CuO-NPs at low concentrations (0.1, 1, and 100 mg/kg) on soil microbial activities associated to the carbon and nitrogen (N) cycles (respiration, nitrification, and denitrification) in five contrasting agricultural soils. The effects of CuO-NPs were compared to those of a Cu ion control (CuSO<sub>4</sub> application) to determine the toxic potential of the Cu nanoparticulate form in comparison to the ionic form. To address the second question, we conducted a follow-up pot experiment to assess the influence of plant presence (winter wheat) on the effects of CuO-NPs on microbial activities over 50 days in the soil that presented the strongest response to the CuO-NPs in the soil microcosm experiment (loam textured LCSA soil).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Soils</title><p>For the microcosm experiment, we selected five soils of contrasting textures and exposed to various agricultural practices: a sandy-loam soil used for vegetable production (Brindas), a loam soil under maize-wheat rotations (LCSA), a silty-clay soil under rape-wheat-barley rotations (Commarin), a silty-clay soil used for maize production (Cless&#x000e9;-Maize) and a silty-clay-loam soil from a vineyard (Cless&#x000e9;-Vine). These soils were collected in the Burgundy and Auvergne-Rh&#x000f4;ne-Alpes Regions (France). More details on the soil characteristics and sample locations are provided in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1A</xref>. Soils were characterized by the Laboratoire d'Analyse des Sols (LAS, Arras, France) for particle-size distribution (texture class), organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Cu concentration using standardized ISO protocols. We mixed several kilograms of the top soil (0&#x02013;15 cm) collected at different locations in each field to obtain a representative composite soil sample, and we transported the soils back to the lab in coolers. The soils were then sieved at 2 mm and stored at 4&#x000b0;C for &#x0003c; 1 week before the beginning of the experiment.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table

The microcosms were incubated in the dark at 28&#x000b0;C for 7 or 90 days and were weekly aerated under a sterile atmosphere for 5 min to renew the atmosphere in the flask. Each treatment was replicated in six independent microcosms, resulting in the incubation and analysis of 300 microcosms (6 replicates &#x000d7; 5 soils &#x000d7; 5 treatments &#x000d7; 2 dates). At the end of each incubation time (7 or 90 days), the microcosms were subsampled for microbial activity measurements (stored at 4&#x000b0;C and analyzed within 3 days), DNA extractions and subsequent qPCR measurements (stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C). On the remaining soil, on day 7, we measured the soil pH using the ISO 10390 protocol for the different treatments.

These results provide evidence that the consequences of CuO-NPs and ionic Cu on soil microbial activities are distinct. In particular, CuO-NPs never presented stimulatory effects on the activities measured, while CuSO<sub>4</sub> addition stimulated NEA in two different soils (Brindas and Cless&#x000e9; Vine) after 90 days. This result might be explained by the Cu requirement of ammonia monooxygenase enzymes catalyzing the first step of NEA (Wagner et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Hence, after 90 days, we can hypothesize that the limitation of bioavailable Cu might have been alleviated by CuSO<sub>4</sub> addition but not by CuO-NP addition in those two soils. Overall, the contrasted effects of the CuO-NPs and ionic Cu treatments on microbial activities are likely explained by the very low dissolution of CuO-NPs in the five soils. The dissolution of CuO-NPs in the five soil solutions was below 2% after 90 days. This result is supported by the study of Gao et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) that also shows slow dissolution rates of CuO-NPs in an agricultural soil. Altogether, these findings suggest that the effects of CuO-NPs were likely principally driven by the Cu nanoparticulate form and not the ionic Cu form.</p></sec><sec><title>Limited Effects of CuO-NPs on Microbial Activities at Low Concentrations and High Decreases of DEA in Most Soils</title><p>The low CuO-NP concentrations tested (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) had no effect on the studied microbial activities, with the exception of the decrease on day 90 of SIR in sandy-loam Brindas soil, and of NEA and DEA in loam LCSA soil. Hence, the results of this microcosm experiment show that CuO-NP exposures at low and relevant concentrations have limited effects on soil microbial activities involved in carbon and N cycles, but that soils presenting a coarse texture (low clay content) might be occasionally affected.</p><p>The lowest concentration tested previously in the literature was 100 mg/kg CuO-NPs; this concentration led to decreases in different microbial enzyme activities (urease, dehydrogenase, phosphatase) in a flooded paddy soil (Xu et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similarly, in our study, we observed that 100 mg/kg CuO-NP caused significant reductions in DEA, NEA, and SIR. In particular, DEA was found to be the most sensitive microbial process to CuO-NP exposure in the short-term (7 days) and longer term (90 days). On day 90, four of the five soils exhibited significant DEA decreases ranging from 21 to 42% in the presence of 100 mg/kg CuO-NP. The medium and fine texture LCSA (loam) and Commarin (silty-clay) soils were found to be the most sensitive soils for the DEA activity. SIR and NEA were less affected by CuO-NP exposure, and significant decreases were observed only in the two soils with the coarse and medium textures (Brindas and LCSA). These findings show that CuO-NPs can have detrimental effects at high concentration (100 mg/kg) in agricultural soils exhibiting very contrasting textures, OM content, pH, and agricultural practices.</p><p>In contrast to other heavy metal contaminants, we did not observe clear patterns indicating a higher toxicity of CuO-NPs on DEA in soils with a coarse texture (high sand content) and low OM content as usually reported (Giller et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Kuan et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Several studies report that NP toxicity varies strongly depending on the types of soils tested but the observed patterns associated with soil texture, pH, and OM content differ both in function of the NP tested and between studies (McKee and Filser, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). More in-depth characterization of the transformations experienced by CuO-NPs in diverse soils and of the soil parameters driving CuO-NP bioavailability and toxicity are needed.</p><p>Denitrifiers have often been found to be insensitive to many toxicants and to even increase in relative abundance in polluted sites, while nitrifiers are frequently reported to be very sensitive to metal pollution (Bissett et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, we were surprised to observe that DEA was the most sensitive microbial process to CuO-NPs in our experiment, especially in comparison to NEA. Denitrifiers exhibit a higher diversity and functional redundancy compared to nitrifiers and also have a larger niche breadth (facultative anaerobes, diversity of organic substrates) that make the DEA generally more resistant and resilient to disturbances (Griffiths and Philippot, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, as nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled, the decline of DEA is often the consequence of a decrease in NEA. Thus, this study shows that in contrast with other NPs (Simonin et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), CuO-NPs have more detrimental effects on DEA than on NEA in the short and long-term in different soils.</p><p>The effects of CuO-NPs on microbial activities did not seem to be related to strong decreases in the abundance of the different microbial groups driving these processes (total bacteria, AOA, AOB, denitrifiers). The microbial abundances remained mainly unchanged by the treatments, and correlations between microbial activities and abundances were observed only in a few soils. Our results suggest that the DEA inhibitions in Brindas and Cless&#x000e9;-Maize soils were not associated with changes in the abundance of <italic>nirS</italic>-bearing denitrifiers. However, the significant correlations between DEA and denitrifier abundance in the LCSA and Cless&#x000e9;-Vine soils indicate that the decreases in denitrification rates were at least partially related to a decrease in denitrifier abundance. More research would be required to determine whether CuO-NPs can affect enzyme synthesis and functioning or lead to modifications in microbial community structure over time that could result in reductions in key microbial activities like denitrification.</p></sec><sec><title>CuO-NP Effects Increase Over Time</title><p>Consistent with many other ecotoxicological studies looking at NP toxicity, we observed that the detrimental effects of CuO-NPs increased over time (Simonin et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; McKee and Filser, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

These toxic effects detected and/or increasing after longer exposures could be explained by several abiotic factors (e.g., pH, DOC, ionic strength) that are dynamic over time and could transform CuO-NPs into an aged form more bioavailable or toxic for microorganisms (Cornelis et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A modification of soil abiotic parameters over the course of the incubation can affect not only CuO-NP fate but also the soil microbial community structure. The temporal variation in microbial community composition and the loss or decline of sensitive taxa to CuO-NPs over time may be a key explanation for the decreases in microbial activities observed after 90 days. Altogether, these results reinforce the idea that short-term ecotoxicological assays may not be adapted to assess the risks associated to NP contamination in soils and may lead to an underestimation of their ecological consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of Microbial Activities by Plant Presence Does Not Mitigate CuO-NP Toxicity</title><p>In the pot experiment, we found that plant presence strongly stimulated heterotrophic microbial activity (i.e., SIR and DEA) likely through inputs of carbon in the rhizosphere as suggested by the positive correlations between the microbial activities and root biomass (Smith and Tiedje, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>; Klemedtsson et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). However, this stimulatory effect of the wheat did not counteract or dampen the negative effects of CuO-NPs on SIR and DEA. Similar reductions to the ones observed in the microcosm experiment (between 30 and 40%) of the microbial activities were observed in the planted pots exposed to CuO-NPs. In particular, SIR was inhibited by both 1 and 100 mg/kg CuO-NP treatments in the presence of wheat, and DEA was reduced when exposed to the highest concentration only. Thus, in this experiment, increased carbon resources provided by the plant did not clearly confer a higher resistance to CuO-NP exposure for the two heterotrophic soil microbial activities measured.</p><p>The reduction of SIR at 1 mg/kg was unexpected because this activity was not affected at the lowest concentrations in the absence of plants and was generally more resistant than DEA in the microcosm experiment. This result suggests that wheat presence modifies the bioavailability and toxicity of CuO-NPs as previously demonstrated (e.g., dissolution, adhesion on roots, uptake, Gao et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) or that the soil microbial community under the influence of the plant would be more sensitive to this pollutant than in the unplanted soil. More work is necessary to determine how plant exudates alter the aging of CuO-NPs in the rhizosphere and the sensitivity of the soil microbial community to this emerging contaminant.</p><p>NEA, a chemoautotrophic activity presenting a lower reliance on organic carbon than SIR and DEA, was not positively affected by plant presence and even decreased slightly in planted soils. The lack of stimulation of NEA in the presence of wheat can be explained by a strong competition for ammonia between nitrifiers and plants (Cantarel et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This alteration of the N cycle in presence of the plant was also highlighted by a stronger correlation observed between NEA and DEA in the unplanted soils. Interestingly, the CuO-NP treatment did not significantly alter NEA in the pot experiment, indicating that the competition for N resources between nitrifiers and the plant did not increase their sensitivity to the contaminant. These results show that the effects of plant presence on CuO-NP toxicity vary according to the microbial activity and the type of plant-microorganism interaction involved (commensalism vs. competition).</p><p>In the context of the potential use of CuO-NPs in agro-chemical products, our results indicate that at low concentrations (1 mg/kg), CuO-NP soil application could lead to an increase in wheat biomass. In our study, these effects were due to a higher allocation of biomass to the roots than to the leaves, which increased the total plant biomass. The stimulatory effect of CuO-NPs on the root system could be explained by different mechanisms, such as the use of dissolved CuO-NPs as micronutrients by plants (as suggested by Dimkpa et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the elimination of plant pathogens by CuO-NPs (Hajipour et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or a plant stress response leading to a higher energy allocation to root growth to compensate the energy costs associated with CuO-NP detoxification (Potters et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). To determine the potential value of applying CuO-NP to wheat crops, future studies will need to determine the effects of CuO-NP exposures on the agroecosystems and their productivity (as grain production, mass and quality) and assess the long-term effects of the alteration of soil microbial activities on soil fertility.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These two experiments show that CuO-NPs can have detrimental effects on soil microbial activities, but most effects occurred at the highest concentration tested (100 mg/kg). Similar to previous studies, we observed that the negative effects of CuO-NPs increase over time, indicating that short-term studies (hours, days) may underestimate the risks posed by these contaminants. The effects differed between the five soils studied, but all soils presented significant reductions in microbial activity. Our results indicated that the most impacted soil was a loam soil with a low OM content (LCSA), though more research is necessary to determine which biotic and abiotic characteristics are the main drivers of this soil sensitivity to CuO-NPs. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the presence of plants influences the microbial response to CuO-NP exposure but does not mitigate or compensate the effects. For example, large decreases in heterotrophic microbial activities were observed in planted soils, even at 1 mg/kg for SIR. Altogether, this study provides a clear demonstration of the necessity to assess the environmental impacts of nanomaterials under realistic experimental conditions to improve the risk assessment of these novel contaminants. Future studies in nanotoxicology need to include systematically low concentrations (&#x003bc;g/kg and low mg/kg range) and take into account soil biological complexity and physico-chemical diversity in their experimental designs to produce an integrative assessment useful for regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS, AAMC, AC, JM, and AR designed the experiments.
