    "The pyrolysis process of various types of biomass (agricultural and wood by-products) in non-isothermal conditions using simultaneous thermal analyses (STA) was investigated. Devolatilization kinetics was implemented through combined application of model-free methods and DAEM (distributed activation energy model) using Gaussian distribution functions of activation energies. Results obtained were used in the curve prediction of the rate of mass loss against temperature at various heating rates by numerical optimization. The possible calculation of biomass samples behavior under pyrolytic conditions as the summation of their pseudo-components, hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin is also explored. The differences between experimental and calculated data are less than 3.20% offering a quality test of applicability of proposed model on the kinetic studies of a wide range of biomass samples. It seems that the most physically realistic model is the decomposition of biomass in three reactions, depending on the composition of the biomass regarding hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin. Kinetic model applied here may serve as a starting point to build more complex models capable of describing the thermal behavior of plant materials during thermochemical processing."
