In face of decreasing support measures for agricultural markets in the European Union, diversified crop portfolios could also offer a possibility to stabilize revenue at farm level (portfolio effect). We hypothesize that (i) diversity of crop portfolios changes along spatial gradients in the study area (Bavaria, Germany), (ii) the composition of portfolios depends on farm parameters, and (iii) more diverse portfolios on arable land provide higher revenue stability. We analysed agricultural census data comprising all farms (<italic>N</italic> = 105 314) in the study area and identified 26 typical crop portfolios. We show that portfolio composition is related to farm characteristics (whole farm revenue, farm type, farm size) and location. Currently, diversification of crop portfolios fails to promote stability of portfolio revenue in the study area, where policy still indirectly influences market prices of energy crops. We conclude that the portfolio effect as a natural insurance was less important in recent years due to high market prices for specific crops. This low need for natural insurances probably favoured simplified portfolios leading to decreased agricultural diversity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011262</institution-id><institution>FP7 Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>311781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koellner</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the European Community&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no 311781, LIBERATION Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fp7liberation.eu">www.fp7liberation.eu</ext-link>).

For example, crop diversity was reported to sustain soil quality, to buffer yield variance against adverse weather events and to substitute fertilizer use while maintaining economic competitiveness [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, crop diversity can increase wildlife habitat quality by reducing the use of agrochemicals [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For a farmer to maintain ecosystem services, crop diversity can be realized across time on the field scale by crop rotation on one hand [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, diversifying the portfolio of cultivated crops maintains diversity in space on the farm scale. On both temporal and spatial scales, provisioning, supporting and regulating ecosystem services benefit from diversified farming [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>On the spatial scale, a diverse crop portfolio provides an insurance effect to mitigate revenue variability at farm level [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This insurance effect is based on the portfolio theory stating that an investor can reduce financial risk by diversifying the portfolio of assets [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the European Union (EU) financial risks were buffered by market support measures (before 1990) and by direct payments coupled to production, favouring agricultural intensification and specialization [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. So, portfolio composition at farm level was strongly influenced by those market support measures in the EU agricultural market. Taking a step towards less regulated markets, the large share of coupled direct payments were replaced in stages by decoupled direct payments between 2005 and 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this time of less regulated markets, risk awareness of farmers should increase [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Following portfolio theory, crop portfolios could then be diversified to scatter income risk as much as possible [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The diversification and risk scattering may be a natural income insurance that could substitute reliance on financial insurances against yield failure [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In turn, availability of financial insurances and regulated markets may decrease the need for this natural income insurance and favour simplified portfolios [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In consequence, policy should aim at stimulating farmers to diversify their portfolios as a natural income insurance because the public would also profit from the increased agrobiodiversity and resulting provision of ecosystem services [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hence, it has to be critically analysed, if this spatial diversification really offers this insurance effect and if less regulated markets consequently really lead to higher crop diversity. For this critical analysis within a certain political environment, the relationship between revenue stability and portfolio diversity has to be understood.</p><p>Besides rationally composing portfolios to adjust for market risks, personal preferences of the farm holder influence portfolio composition [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The choice is further constrained by the physical and socio-economic environment in which a farm is situated [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the physical landscape, climate conditions and soil quality have a strong impact on crop choice if aiming at the optimization of yield under the respective local conditions [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Beyond this, portfolio composition is influenced by farm specific parameters. Bradshaw [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that portfolio diversity is higher on larger farms. This might be related to the fact that small farm holders are in greater need to complement their low farm household revenue with income from off-farm work. This off-farm income makes them more independent from on-farm yield and revenue risk [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Correspondingly, on those part time farms there is less need for low-risk portfolios which could result in a higher input of agro-chemicals as well as in a decreased portfolio diversity compared to larger farms [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Direct political guidelines also influence farmers&#x02019; decision-making. In particular in organic framing, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU demands increased portfolio diversity [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, organic farming restricts input of industrial fertilizer, so that portfolios have to be more diverse to compensate for the missing external input [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Accordingly, more diverse portfolios could be found in organic farming. Furthermore, the degree of specialization influences portfolio diversity. Specialized farms rely on high external chemical input that goes along with simplified portfolios, while integrated farms (crop and livestock) are more related to decreased external input and more circular economy so that more diversified portfolios are realized [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. If, however, a farm might be diversified in manifold ways by involvement in permanent crop cultivation, animal husbandry, tourism, and off-farm work, this leaves less time and need for diversification of crop portfolios on the arable land of the farm. Thus, farms with a high income complementing arable land use might have low portfolio diversity on arable land [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Besides diversification of the crop portfolio, crop rotation systems can be used to balance productivity on the field scale [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Relying on crop rotation systems could thus be another factor that decreases the need to diversify crop portfolio on farm level.</p><p>Since crop diversity and portfolio composition are essential for ecosystem services in the agricultural landscape, it is important to analyse how the physical and socio-economic environments constrain the portfolio composition. Only thus can we understand how policy could enhance portfolio diversity and how clear policy schemes for enhancing ecosystem services in agricultural systems could be developed. To our knowledge, most studies that tried to find the connection between crop portfolio composition and ecological, economic and farm-specific factors concentrated on a small number of sample farms. Given the multitude of interactions, however, this link might be better understood from a larger geographic perspective&#x02014;an approach we pursue in this work.</p><p>Our goal was to analyse regionally specific crop portfolios and to give further insights into how the choice of crops and composition of crop portfolios is influenced by geographical and socio-economic farm parameters in Bavaria (Germany). In an approach combining both descriptive and correlative techniques for analysis of large data sets, all farms (<italic>N</italic> = 105 314) of the complete Free State of Bavaria were incorporated in one analysis. We determine typical crop portfolios for farms in Bavaria and analyse their diversity on the spatial scale. We further evaluate the study-area specific relationship between portfolio diversity on arable land and temporal revenue stability of those portfolios. Since the whole analysis is based on the diversity of these farm-specific crop portfolios, the work is clearly focussed on the farm scale. We test the hypothesis that portfolio diversity changes along spatial gradients (H1). This is based on the assumption that agriculture is adequately adapted to local geographic (physical and economic) conditions. Moreover, we hypothesize that portfolio composition of individual farms depends on socio-economic parameters and that higher diversity is found on larger farms, in full-time compared to part-time farming, on farms integrated arable farming and animal husbandry, in farming without intra-annual crop rotation, and on farms where whole farm revenue largely originates from arable land use (H2). Testing the portfolio theory in Bavarian agriculture, we hypothesize that more diverse portfolios offer a more stable risk&#x02013;revenue relationship (H3).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>Our study area is the Free State of Bavaria, Germany (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207454.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

The data was made available by the Bavarian Statistical Office (L<sc>f</sc>S<sc>tat</sc>: <italic>Bayerisches Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Statistik</italic>). In Bavaria, the census included all officially recorded farms (<italic>N</italic> = 105 314). Since we focussed our study on analysing arable land use only, we excluded forestry and agricultural businesses without any arable land (mostly enterprises specialized in animal farming only). In doing so, a total of <italic>N</italic> = 79 532 farms remained that correspond to the total area of arable land in Bavaria corresponding to one third of the state area.</p><p>Land use on each farm was characterized by the area share in percent of 41 crop categories of either single crops or crop families (e.g. <italic>vegetables and strawberries</italic> listed as one crop category; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207454.s009">S2 Table</xref>). General data about the farms in the year 2010 contained information about location, annual whole farm revenue (estimated total agricultural production without costs), type of farming, soil cultivation (area share of applied method in percent) and size of arable land (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207454.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Individual costs are not part of the census due to data privacy. We refrained from estimating the mean farm costs because they are not representative for the individual way of conducting farm business (e.g. intensity of using resources).</p><p>A high level of data protection had to be respected when analysing the census data. Thus, no minimum and maximum values are displayed in graphics referring to <sc>lz</sc>2010 census data.

Prices of green maize and legumes had to be calibrated and reconstructed referring to the price of grain maize. Fallow and unused land were assumed to be zero revenue commodities because we only focus on stability of farm revenue on arable land measured by immediate cash return. Just as for fallow land, we also leave considerations about long-term return from other ecosystem services aside for all other crop categories. Price data and yield data were used to calculate the annual revenue per area and crop (without costs). To calculate the portfolio revenue, the revenue of related individual crops was weighted by their area share. The revenue for the crop category <italic>vegetables and strawberries</italic> was calculated from the price and yield data of 1/3 asparagus, 1/3 carrots, and 1/3 strawberries. We did so because the agricultural census only reports the area used for vegetable and strawberry cultivation in summary without further details on which vegetables were cultivated at each individual farm. Given the high importance of asparagus and carrot cultivation in Bavaria [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and with regard to availability of yield and price time series, we thus built this exemplary model portfolio composition to represent the category vegetables and strawberries.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Empirical crop portfolios</title><p>A set of representative crop portfolios for Bavaria were empirically derived from the <sc>lz</sc>2010 survey data by clustering according to the relative area share of crops cultivated on individual farms in the survey year 2010.

As described by Kaufmann and Rousseeuw [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], <sc>clara</sc> draws <italic>S</italic> sub-samples of size <italic>n</italic> = <italic>s</italic>.

The number of clusters <italic>k</italic> was determined by maximizing the overall average silhouette width. It compares the similarity of points inside their assigned cluster to the similarity to all other clusters and is a measure of the quality of clustering. We optimized the number of clusters in two steps [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Modern agricultural intensification and simplification is strongly climatically constrained and prone to yield failures due to adverse weather events [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Higher soil quality can buffer the effect of these adverse weather events on crop performance more efficiently [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, on soils with higher quality, agriculture can be intensified towards simplified portfolios to increase the income with less concern for risk of yield failure [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the regions of the study area with poorer agricultural or economical potential receive a compensatory allowance (<italic>Ausgleichszulage</italic>) from the EU, the German state, and the federal state of Bavaria [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The compensatory allowance is granted if specialization on intensified cultures (maize, wheat, sugar beet, hop, and vegetables) is avoided. As a result, both poorer soil quality and compensatory allowances increase crop diversity of portfolios in areas of Bavaria with lower agricultural potential. Accordingly, location (administrative district) was a strong predictor in the random forest model for portfolio composition. In addition, we could show a clear gradient of portfolio diversity increasing from south to north. In agreement with our hypothesis, this highlights that due to physical and political conditions farm location is an important constraint for portfolio composition for Bavarian farmers.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Portfolio composition depends on socio-economic characteristics of individual farms (H2)</title><p>We could confirm that more diverse portfolios were cultivated on larger farms. This is partly due to Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, which demands a minimum of two or three crops for farms larger than 10 or 30 hectares [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, integrated farming (arable land use and animal husbandry) that was connected to more diverse portfolios, was practised on larger farms. Fodder production for farm livestock on those large, integrated farms requires cultivation of a variety of forage and protein rich grain crops. This results eventually in planting diversified portfolios of maize and grain crops complemented by legumes and oil seeds [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, a diversified crop portfolio on integrated farms may be seen as consequence of animal husbandry on one hand. On the other hand, the integration of animal husbandry with diverse crop portfolios may also directly arise from a farmer&#x02019;s decision to optimally balance farm productivity and supporting ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient recycling) in closed-loop farming [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Our results show that diversity of crop portfolios is lower on smaller farms.

Thus, crop diversity at the regional scale may profit from larger, integrated farms. On the local scale, however, Fahrig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that agrobiodiversity and ecosystem services benefit from smaller field size. Consequently, policy could aim at reducing the field size on large integrated farms to promote both agrobiodiversity on the local scale and crop diversity on the landscape scale. Alternatively, Prager [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] suggested that agri-environmental schemes should be increasingly adjusted across collaborations of farms, to relieve small farms in particular from the demand to individually diversify the landscape. This is already partly recognized in CAP and proved to be a valuable tool to maintain ecosystem services in agriculture on the landscape scale [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The farm type &#x02018;organic farming&#x02019; was a less important predictor for portfolio composition. This weak relationship between organic farming and portfolio composition might contradict the assumption that organic farming implies different decision making than conventional farming [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the weakness of the relationship could be an artefact of the random forest analysis. In fact, random forest prefers continuous predictors and those with many categories [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the effect of organic farming on portfolio composition might have been underestimated. Organic farming was related to very low to very high diversity portfolios. This contrasts the hypothesis of organic farming being more diverse [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. On the one hand, EU regulations for organic farming demand increased agrobiodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, the income security supplied by subsidies for organic farming could also encourage farmers to maximize short-term income with more risky, simplified portfolios [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, our results showed that organic farming indeed affected the portfolio composition, however, not in a simple and linear way.</p><p>The whole-farm revenue was an important predictor for portfolio composition. The portfolios with highest diversity (mixed dominance of grain, maize, and others) were related to farms with average whole-farm revenue per hectare. As previously discussed, those portfolios are strongly related to integrated farms and diversity is a by-product of supplying the livestock with fodder. Additionally to arable farming, those farms obviously complement their revenue with animal husbandry. In contrast, those farms that rely on arable land use only have a lower whole-farm revenue per hectare. Thus, the moderately diverse grain dominated portfolios were found on farms with below average whole-farm revenue per hectare because those portfolios are typical for farms specialized on arable farming. The low diversity portfolios dominated by maize or portfolios of speciality crops were found on farms with high whole-farm revenue per hectare. As was pointed out earlier, the maize portfolios were strongly linked to the farm type specialized on fodder production. By definition of the <sc>lz</sc>2010 survey, this farm type also includes animal husbandry [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, in case of maize portfolios, this high whole-farm revenue per hectare might also be related to farms complementing their budget with animal husbandry. Here, arable land use can be simplified because revenue volatility from arable land use can be financially compensated by other farm activities [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, speciality crops offer high revenue from arable land (high portfolio revenue), so that high whole-farm revenue is also typical for highly specialized farms. We found that the whole-farm revenue is strongly related to portfolio composition and portfolio diversity. Following the above argumentation, however, the whole-farm revenue is closely related to farm type in the study area. So farm type could actually be related to portfolio composition, while the relationship to the whole-farm revenue could be an indirect correlation.</p><p>In summary, portfolio composition was related to farm characteristics and location. Our findings highlight that additionally to the constraints of the physical and political environments, farm characteristics restrict the set of portfolios, from which equally constrained farmers could choose. With these strong local differences and impact of socio-economic situation of a farm, policy schemes that aim at maintaining diversity and ecosystem services are of more use if adjusted to the regional and farm situation [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Stability of income does not increase with portfolio diversity (H3)</title><p>Farmers&#x02019; adaptation to short-term market situations and optimization of revenue sometimes favours intensified farming and selection of simplified rather than diversified portfolios [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, choosing simplified portfolios to achieve a higher mean revenue may generally counterbalance taking higher risks [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This is also suggested by our results. Contrasting our hypothesis, stability of revenue did not increase with portfolio diversity in the study period 2000&#x02013;2013. However, the risk to revenue ratio was very much the same for all portfolios in our study area, which is in line with findings of Abson et al. Abson2013 for the United Kingdom. In Germany, the demand for green maize and rapeseed as energy crops is currently high and agricultural landscapes are increasingly characterized by cultivation of rapeseed or maize in monoculture [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While in former times cultivation of potatoes was wide spread in the study area, it is now of minor importance in the portfolios and reflects the recent trend of decreasing potato cultivation in Germany [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As such, the present decline in potato cultivation is an example for consequences of economic rationalism in face of declining market potential for certain crops [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Increasing global demand for major energy and food crops (wheat, maize, rapeseed) makes it more economically rational to simplify portfolios aiming at short-term profit [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0207454.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The revenue peaks that can be achieved with those energy crops overrule revenue variability. Especially in South Germany, both increasing biogas production that was promoted by the German Renewable Energy Act (<italic>Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, EEG</italic>) and increasing livestock density additionally favoured such market situations of continuously high prices for energy crops [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Promoting renewable energy use by law seems thus to counteract the aim of EU agricultural policy to diversify the agricultural landscape [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Crop market prices were recently decoupled from subsidies in the EU in favour of self-regulating agricultural diversification following portfolio theory [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. With the relatively stable, high price level for energy crops, achieving a portfolio effect by portfolio diversification was thus a less attractive means to secure revenue for Bavarian farmers. New amendments already aim to reduce the strong impact of the EEG on agricultural market situations, but the consequences of the EEG will last into the future [<xref rid="pone.0207454.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, nowadays, relying on decoupled market situations is not enough to guarantee diversification of the agricultural landscape in the study area.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that composition of crop portfolios is related to socio-economic farm characteristics and constrained by local soil quality and farm size. Furthermore, our results suggest that more diverse crop portfolios currently do not promote a higher revenue stability from arable land use in the study area, where policy still indirectly influences market prices of energy crops. Thus, at present, revenue stability does not motivate diversification of crop portfolios.</p><p>Diversification in agricultural landscapes, however, is important to maintain provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services that benefit farmers as well as the public. Indeed, our results show that especially small farms did not maintain high portfolio diversity. Especially in Bavaria, with its many small farms, maintenance of ecosystem services by on-site diversification might be difficult to realize at farm level. Therefore, appropriate diversification schemes could be regionally adjusted among farms because the economic value of ecosystem services maintained by diversified land use is expressed at the landscape scale. Accordingly, EU&#x02019;s rural development and environmental protection policy should aim at increasing crop diversity on the regional scale across conglomerates of smaller farms. Since those smaller farms naturally maintain agrobiodiversity on the local scale due to their smaller field size, homogenization of arable land use should in turn be tolerated at individual farms with smaller fields. The strong impact of location and farm characteristics on portfolio composition shown in this study suggests that respective policy schemes should be adapted to farm types at the local scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0207454.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Spatial temperature and precipitation patterns in Bavaria based on the period 1950&#x02013;2000.</title><p>Annual temperature range is given as difference of maximum and minimum monthly temperature.
