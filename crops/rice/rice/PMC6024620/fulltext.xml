After excluding countries with limited or no documentation, 72 reviews were completed, representing 84 country-grain combinations. Based on best practices, a criteria checklist was created with 44 items that should be included in fortification documents. Two reviewers independently scored each available document set for a given country and food vehicle (a country-grain combination) using the checklist, and then reached consensus on the scoring. We calculated the percentage of country-grain combinations containing each checklist item and examined differences in scores by grain, region, and income level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 72 country-grain combinations, the majority of documentation came from countries in the Americas (46%) and Africa (32%), and most were from upper and lower middle-income countries (73%). The majority of country-grain combinations had documentation stating the food vehicle(s) to be fortified (97%) and the micronutrients (e.g., iron) (100%), fortificants (e.g., ferrous fumarate) (88%), and fortification levels required (96%). Most (78%) stated that labeling is required to indicate a product is fortified. Many country-grain combinations described systems for external (64%) monitoring, and stated that industry is required to follow quality assurance/quality control (64%), though detailed protocols (33%) and roles and responsibilities (45%) were frequently not described.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most country-grain combinations have systems in place for internal, external, and import monitoring. However, documentation of other important items that would influence product compliance to national standard, such as roles and responsibilities between agencies, the cost of regulating fortification, and enforcement strategies, are often lacking. Countries with existing mandatory fortification can improve upon these items in revisions to their documentation while countries that are beginning fortification can use the checklist to assist in developing new policies and programs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Large-scale fortification of staple foods is a cost-effective and sustainable strategy for substantially reducing micronutrient malnutrition.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The fortification of cereal grains with folic acid, iron, zinc, vitamin B12, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin A, and other micronutrients has gained global traction as a strategy to improve human health.

According to the Food Fortification Initiative, in 2016, 34% of industrially milled wheat flour, 57% of industrially milled maize flour, and 1% of industrially milled rice was fortified (71%, 29%, and 45% of wheat flour, maize flour, and rice, respectively, was industrially milled), and 87 countries mandated the fortification of at least one of these cereal grains.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>For governments to ensure effective food fortification, enactment of laws and regulations provide legal authority and a regulatory framework.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Mandatory fortification, as compared to voluntary, is more likely to achieve and sustain the desired health benefits of fortification.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The regulatory framework specific to food fortification provides the basis for ensuring the quality and safety of products and for meeting public health nutrition objectives.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Practical implementation of fortification is challenging though, as evidenced by global insufficient compliance against fortification standards.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Therefore, periodic government monitoring will help determine whether program objectives are being met.</p><p>Given the challenges of implementing large-scale, cereal-grain fortification, effective legislation, standards, and monitoring documents can provide clear guidance on key program decisions, activities, and milestones such as the micronutrients/premix required; financial responsibility of implementing and monitoring and enforcing fortification; labeling of fortified products; internal, external, commercial, and import monitoring procedures; incentives and penalties; laboratory methods; and reporting guidelines.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The objectives of this review are to assess the content of legislation, standards, and monitoring documents used to guide mandatory cereal grain fortification programs in countries and to identify areas of strength and areas needing improvement.

The checklist was then revised by content experts, who also suggested pertinent studies for consideration. As part of the literature review, studies of legislation surrounding mandatory or voluntary fortification of any food vehicle were included, specifically studies of legislation for industrial fortification (as opposed to home-based fortification, which employs the use of a supplement, not fortified food). Legislative frameworks for fortification and case studies of legislation development or monitoring procedures were also included. Manuals for legislation, standards, and enforcement of food law and fortification, as well as manuals developed for implementing components of a fortification program, were also included in the literature review. Lastly, we included any studies that contained suggestions for model laws or any studies on monitoring of fortification programs.</p><p>We piloted the criteria checklist with a subset of 11 country-grain combinations. Following the pilot, we pared down the checklist and focused on items relevant to fortification (as opposed to general food control measures).

All coauthors conducted the reviews (8 reviewers in total); the 3 reviewers involved in the development of the checklist and the pilot (KJM, CLL, HP) were paired with the other 5 reviewers to ensure consistency across reviews. Three reviewers (XL, LMD-R, HP) reviewed the Spanish-language sets in Spanish. Reviewers completed the checklist by scoring each item using &#x0201c;does not contain item&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;contains item in its totality.&#x0201d; About one-third of items on the checklist (n=15) also had &#x0201c;contains item to some degree&#x0201d; as an option. One-quarter of items on the checklist (n=10) had &#x0201c;not applicable&#x0201d; as an option. There was a comment field adjacent to each item for qualitative observations.

We compiled completed checklists for each country-grain combination, including extracted sample language from the documents reviewed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghspjournal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.9745/GHSP-D-17-00427/-/DCSupplemental">Supplement Table 4</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of legislation, standards, and monitoring documents for any fortified food, and specifically for fortified grains. Our study provides a standardized checklist of 44 key criteria that the literature suggests are important components of fortification legislation, standards, and monitoring documents, which was in turn employed on a global level to systematically measure the documentation of each country-grain combination and to evaluate country policies against these criteria. We found that countries document the technical specifications for fortification, such as allowable food vehicles and nutrients required, and most document systems for internal, external, and import monitoring. However, documentation is lacking in some areas, such as describing the roles and responsibilities for monitoring between governmental agencies, providing detailed descriptions of protocols and systems for monitoring, addressing the costs of fortification and fortification monitoring, outlining enforcement strategies, and describing how government monitoring results are reported to stakeholders. Lack of documentation persisted largely around the areas that would influence product compliance to national standard, while sufficient documentation existed around areas that establish a mandatory program. This is important to highlight, as it is a more complex piece that needs to be carefully outlined (e.g., assigning clear roles and responsibilities for regulatory monitoring, establishing detailed protocols for conducting regulatory monitoring) if a program is going to be monitored for long-term adherence and impact.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Given these gaps, our checklist could be used as a guide to strengthen existing documentation or assist in developing new documentation, as this would ensure important areas, such as product compliance, are outlined.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>Most countries lack documentation around the areas that would influence product compliance to national standard.</p></boxed-text><p>Our study found similar results as a review of legislative frameworks for corn flour and maize meal fortification.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Similar to our study, Makhumula and colleagues found that legislative and standards documents commonly describe fortificants used, fortification labeling, reference analytical assays, and sampling procedures.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In our review, 100% (n=11) of maize flour countries documented the fortificants to be used and 91% (n=10) of maize flour countries clearly labeled their maize flour as fortified. Of the 4 maize flour countries that stated the use of sampling in external and import monitoring, 3 provided details on sampling procedures for external and import monitoring. The majority of maize flour countries referenced the required analytical assays for nutrients (73%, n=8) in our review. Differences observed might be because the checklist for our study was specific to fortification, whereas Makhumula and colleagues' review was not limited to fortification. In particular, this might explain any differences observed in sampling procedures and analytical assays; sampling and laboratory testing could include food safety parameters in Makhumula and colleagues' review.</p><p>One notable conclusion from Makhumula and colleagues was that countries fortifying maize flour take a variety of approaches to setting fortification levels, such as specifying the minimum amount required or an allowable range.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In our study, a slight majority (55%, n=6) of maize flour countries provide a range or a single number within an allowable range, while 45% (n=5) of countries provide a single number only. Opposing results were found for wheat flour and rice in this study: 40% (n=22) of wheat flour and 33% (n=2) of rice countries provide a range or single number within an allowable range, while 53% (n=29) of wheat flour and 67% (n=4) of rice countries provide a single number only (the remaining 7% (n=4) of wheat flour countries did not state fortification levels). These results confirm Makhumula's maize flour findings and suggest there are inconsistencies between food vehicles and countries in stating fortification levels, and clarity is needed on this issue.</p><p>A 2015 survey by Luthringer and colleagues highlights the gap between legislation, standards, and monitoring documents and barriers in the monitoring of fortified foods identified by regulatory agencies and the food industry.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Gaps identified in the documentation reviewed in our study support the survey results reported by Luthringer et al. For example, when asked in the survey to prioritize regulatory monitoring elements needing improvement to ensure compliance against national fortification standards, industry respondents prioritized incentives and penalties for enforcement, both areas of weakness in the documentation reviewed in our study (only 10% of documentation stated incentives are offered to continue fortification and 21% objectively defined penalties). While incentives are rarely documented, Luthringer and colleagues' study suggests that both regulatory agency and industry respondents believed that incentives could encourage compliance with fortification regulations. Survey results also indicated that only slightly more than half of regulatory agencies report regularly sharing their data with stakeholders. In the documentation reviewed in our study, only 31% of country-grain combinations require government monitoring results to be reported. Together, these results suggest that few countries require results to be reported, while slightly more claim to report results. The benefits of a requirement to report results could be written into official documentation, compelling the reporting of results to stakeholders and creating an accountability structure. Lastly, Luthringer et al.'s study identified the lack of clarity in the roles of government authorities as a barrier to effective monitoring; our study found a similar lack of clarity in the documentation.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> When two or more agencies were involved, roles and responsibilities were only clarified in 32% to 45% of documentation, dependent on monitoring type, indicating that this is an area of documentation that could be strengthened. On the whole, the opinions expressed by regulatory agency and industry respondents in the survey conducted by Luthringer et al. are confirmed by the present study. Not only do the survey respondents think that documentation is unclear but also our study confirms that documentation is generally lacking in the areas identified by the survey respondents.</p><p>While our study aligns with previous studies of fortification legislation, standards, and monitoring documents, it also highlights concerns that previous studies have not raised.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> For instance, the majority of previous studies have not reviewed the content of monitoring documents.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Our study found that the details included in monitoring documents vary widely&#x02014;some countries do not have any monitoring procedures in their dossier of documentation, while other countries have a unique manual for each type of monitoring. In particular, our study identifies the lack of documented protocols and systems in external, commercial, and import monitoring (39%, 60%, and 39%, respectively). Our study corroborates a previous study by van den Wijngaart et al. (2013)<sup>21</sup> that identified the issue of poorly established or weakly designed protocols and systems for regulatory monitoring of salt and wheat flour fortification in countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); our study found that for the 3 types of regulatory monitoring, 21% to 28% of country-grain combinations did not explicitly describe their monitoring protocols (scored as &#x0201c;partly meeting&#x0201d;). While the van den Wijngaart et al. study and our study are in agreement about the variable quality of monitoring procedures, our study notes the complete lack of documentation. This finding emphasizes the opportunity to improve upon existing monitoring procedures and the opportunity to implement well-designed monitoring procedures for the first time. Additionally, our study shows infrequent documentation requiring qualitative (spot) tests in internal (29%) and external monitoring (19%). While it is possible that spot tests are used but not documented in monitoring procedures, this result shows an opportunity to expand the use of this simple, fast, and inexpensive method.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><p>There is a lack of documented protocols and systems in external, commercial, and import monitoring.</p></boxed-text><sec id="s4.1"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>First, an important strength of our study is that such a comprehensive review for any cereal grain and for any fortified food has not previously been done. Previous efforts have focused on reviewing legislation and/or standards, while few have included monitoring documents; our study included all 3 types of documents for a more complete sense of content. Furthermore, each country in our study was objectively scored using a standardized checklist of key items in official fortification legislation, standards, and monitoring documents by two separate reviewers. Other strengths of our study are the inclusion of documents from 84% of countries (68 of 81 countries) that mandated cereal-grain fortification as of January 31, 2015, regardless of the language of the document, and the examination of multiple food vehicles within the cereal-grain family. The checklist we created for this study can be used by countries as a framework for starting a new fortification program or assessing a current fortification program. An additional strength is that this methodology presents a model with which to expand this research to other food vehicles, such as salt and vegetable oils.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is the possibility of missing documentation. However, attempts were made to collect missing documentation from country representatives, and a sensitivity analysis showed few differences between those countries where country representatives confirmed documentation and those who did not. It was assumed that the knowledge of and access to documents was complete and up to date for the country representatives that were reached. Furthermore, selection bias may be an issue, as those countries that were excluded due to a lack of documentation likely have less comprehensive legislation, standards, and/or monitoring guidelines than those included. This bias may be particularly problematic when comparing scores by region, as there were 7 excluded countries from the Middle East region (78% of countries in the region), 5 from Africa (22%), and 1 from Asia (25%). It is possible that some details were lost in the translation of the documents into English from some languages, but few documents were not already in English or Spanish. Furthermore, it is possible that the checklist was incomplete and did not include some important items that countries prioritize in their documents. However, this risk is low and was mitigated through an inclusive process of listing, refining, and prioritizing the items by considering the existing literature, expert opinion, and through pilot testing for other items that were in reviewed documents. Lastly, our study only addresses documentation, not implementation; while it seems plausible that countries with good documentation also have good implementation of that documentation (and vice-versa), our study did not address implementation of the documentation reviewed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our comprehensive review of 72 country-grain combinations found that the majority adequately document the required food vehicles, nutrients, and amounts of fortificants for fortification. Most countries have documented justification of the need for monitoring, but detailed protocols, roles and responsibilities for monitoring between agencies, and systems are not well defined. Furthermore, few countries document strategies for paying for the cost of fortification or alleviating the burden on industry through tax exemption or other economic incentives, which can be important in ensuring the sustainability and success of a fortification program. By identifying areas that are often weak or absent in legislation, standards, and monitoring documents, countries with existing mandatory fortification can improve upon these items in revisions to their documents, while countries that are new to fortification will have a better sense of what to include in their policies and programs from the beginning.</p><p>Going forward, this study's checklist can be used by many stakeholders. The in-country representatives of private, civic, and public sectors who oversee fortification activities can use the checklist to assess and revise the documents that guide their country's programs. Organizations that provide technical assistance to countries can use the checklist to find common themes across countries and offer technical assistance through regional workshops, for example, or targeted technical assistance based on countries' specific needs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
