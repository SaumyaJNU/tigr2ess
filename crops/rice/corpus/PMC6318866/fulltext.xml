This led to variable advice being given to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par2">In 2015, British Inherited Metabolic Disease Group (BIMDG) dietitians (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;70) were sent a multiple-choice questionnaire on the interpretation of protein from food-labels and the allocation of different foods. Based on majority responses, 16 statements were developed. Over 18-months, using Delphi methodology, these statements were systematically reviewed and refined with a facilitator recording discussion until a clear majority was attained for each statement.

Untreated, it will cause severe, irreversible neurological damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Strict dietary management is the only available treatment option in the UK. The aim is to correct abnormal biochemistry by decreasing the Phe load on the affected pathway and supplementation with Phe -free L-amino acids or low Phe glycomacropeptide protein substitutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The diet involves avoiding high protein foods (e.g. meat, fish, eggs, cheese, seeds, flour, bread and nuts), with strict control of moderate containing protein foods (e.g. cereals, potato, milk and some vegetables) to maintain blood Phe levels within target range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several fruits and vegetables are low in Phe and are incorporated in the diet without limit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. From weaning when solids are first introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and later with the ever growing convenience food market, patients with PKU and their caregivers need simple, consistent, easy-to-understand rules for calculating protein intake. A national dietetic re-appraisal of some of the practical dietary advice given to UK patients and families with PKU was necessary because of: the recent publication of European PKU guidelines identifying different criteria for the allocation of fruit and vegetables in a low Phe diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; introduction of new species of fruits and vegetables; new European protein labelling legislation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; contradictory information available via social media; and increasing patient usage of manufactured foods.</p><p id="Par11">The British Inherited Metabolic Diseases&#x000a0;(BIMDG) Dietitians Group, using the Delphi method set out to agree a set of practical statements about the classifications of foods in a low Phe diet. The Delphi process is a tool used to gain a majority decision in a structured or systematic manor. It helps secure a collective view from a panel of experts about complex issues or problems where there is little or no definitive evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Experts respond to questionnaires over several rounds with a facilitator coordinating and summarising responses for feedback. Responses and feedback from each expert, guide the questions for further rounds. With each successive round the number of questions declines as the group moves toward consensus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p id="Par12">To develop consensus statements about the practical allocation of foods and interpretation of protein food labelling in a low Phe diet for the management of PKU in the UK using the Delphi method to generate consensus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par13">In November 2015, BIMDG dietitians convened to discuss the allocation of foods and interpretation of food labeling with the aim of developing consensus statements for PKU. A multiple-choice questionnaire, comprising 14 questions about dietary advice to UK patients or caregivers regarding the allocation of different foods (allowed without measurement, not allowed, or allowed as part of Phe exchanges) and interpretation of protein from food labels, was distributed to 70 BIMDG dietitians from 30 centres treating individuals with PKU. The results of this questionnaire identified 7 specific areas where dietetic practice was variable, leading to contradictory advice being issued to patients and caregivers. These 7 areas are identified in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Variation in dietary advice given to patients by BIMDG dietitians</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">

We have systematic agreement on many basic dietary rules and definitions which have received united support from BIMDG dietitians. Using the Delphi method allowed all BIMDG dietitians to have the opportunity to give their opinion and influence several areas of dietary management in PKU where scientific evidence was unavailable to dictate practice. For most of the statements, clear consensus was reached in the first round of Delphi discussions, leaving only 4 controversial statements requiring more extensive discussion and negotiation. The process we have undertaken should lead to harmonization and consistency of dietetic practice in PKU with less confusion for professionals, patients and their families. Adoption of these consensus statements by the national patient&#x02019;s society, NSPKU, will enable uniform written dietary information to be available for all patients. Further adaptation of these statements is necessary for maternal PKU, where dietary management practices are particularly rigorous. This exercise will be taken forward by the BIMDG dietitians working in adult practice.</p><p id="Par31">The advantage of the Delphi method is that it involves the collective knowledge of a group of experts which is likely to be better than that of each individual; comparing, contrasting, challenging and complementing each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The process is directed, impartial, helps engender group ownership, encourages consensus among individuals with diverse views and is an alternative to conventional meetings where strong personalities, status and group pressures can influence individual responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was clear that every opinion was valued and would be important in influencing the final decisions. Because this method is structured and focused, it can avoid much of the counterproductive digressions identifiable in face-to-face group discussions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to the combined contribution of all members, varying ideas and viewpoints were generated and these further directed later responses.</p><p id="Par32">The Delphi Method did have some limitations. Being a qualitative method, it is considered subjective. However, in our consensus statements, only best practice opinion was available to support any of the specific decisions reached; when new scientific evidence is available these statements will be challenged. Also, 70 dietitians participated, which could be considered a limitation. However, the number of experts chosen was designed to be inclusive of all centres and dietitians in the UK who were members of the BIMDG dietitians group. Another drawback of the process was the tendency for participants to maintain the status quo rather than voting for change. For example, for two of the consensus statements, despite good initial agreement in round 1, further discussion identified the impracticality of the statements which prompted the generation of 3 possible options for round 2. A further limitation was the lack of response from some members. Unfortunately, this was unavoidable due to maternity leave, job changes and retirements occurring during the 18-month period of the project. Some dietetic non-responders were new to the IMD specialty or were from centres with fewer patients and or less clinical experience and may have been reluctant to respond due to uncertainty or a lack of definitive opinion. Despite some non-responding dietitians, most UK IMD centres were represented in each round.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par33">In conclusion, this process of agreement between BIMDG dietitians across the UK will enable the introduction of consistent, easy-to-understand rules for calculating protein intake for professionals and patients with PKU. Both dietitians working in paediatric and adult services have endorsed these consensus statements which should contribute to a smooth transition between services, maintaining uniformity of information across all ages. Modification of the consensus statements may be warranted for maternal PKU patients requiring more rigorous dietary restriction. It will be important to perform an evaluation of the interpretation of these statements by dietitians and patients in clinical practice. Overall these consensus statements contribute to harmonising dietary advice offered to British PKU patients. Longitudinal monitoring of their application, acceptance and adherence by health professionals and patients or caregivers is essential.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BIMDG</term><def><p id="Par5">British Inherited Metabolic Diseases&#x000a0;Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMD</term><def><p id="Par6">Inherited Metabolic Diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSPKU</term><def><p id="Par7">National Society for Phenylketonuria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Phe</term><def><p id="Par8">Phenylalanine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PKU</term><def><p id="Par9">Phenylketonuria</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par34">No funding was required as this project was conducted as part of routine service by all the dietitians involved.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par35">The supporting datasets analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in the initial conception and design (through BIMDG dietitians group meetings, conferences and teleconferences), data collection (using the Delphi Method), interpretation of the data and critical revision of the paper for important intellectual content and final approval of the version to be published.
