    "Root hairs are valuable in taking up nutrients and water from the rhizosphere and serving as sites of interactions with soil microorganisms. By increasing the external surface area of the roots or interacting with rhizobacteria, root hairs directly and indirectly promote plant growth and yield. Transcriptome data can be used to understand root-hair development in rice.We performed Agilent 44Â K microarray experiments with enriched root-hair samples and identified 409 root hair-preferential genes in rice. The expression patterns of six genes were confirmed using a GUS reporter system and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis demonstrated that 13 GO terms, including oxygen transport and cell wall generation, were highly over-represented in those genes. Although comparative analysis between rice and Arabidopsis revealed a large proportion of orthologous pairs, their spatial expression patterns were not conserved. To investigate the molecular network associated with root hair-preferential genes in rice, we analyzed the PPI network as well as coexpression data. Subsequently, we developed a refined network consisting of 24 interactions between 10 genes and 18 of their interactors.Identification of root hair-preferential genes and in depth analysis of those genes will be a useful reference to accelerate the understanding of root-hair development in rice."
