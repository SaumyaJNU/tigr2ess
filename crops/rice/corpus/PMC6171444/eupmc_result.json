    "In this study, we evaluated the effect of different temperatures (10, 20, 30, and 40 °C) and relative humidities (RHs; 12, 44, 76, and 98%) on populations of predominant grain fungi (Aspergillus candidus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium fellutanum, and Penicillium islandicum) and the biocontrol activity of Pseudomonas protegens AS15 against aflatoxigenic A. flavus KCCM 60330 in stored rice. Populations of all the tested fungi in inoculated rice grains were significantly enhanced by both increased temperature and RH. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that one unit increase of temperature resulted in greater effects than that of RH on fungal populations. When rice grains were treated with P. protegens AS15 prior to inoculation with A. flavus KCCM 60330, fungal populations and aflatoxin production in the inoculated grains were significantly reduced compared with the grains untreated with strain AS15 regardless of temperature and RH (except 12% RH for fungal population). In addition, bacterial populations in grains were significantly enhanced with increasing temperature and RH, regardless of bacterial treatment. Higher bacterial populations were detected in biocontrol strain-treated grains than in untreated control grains. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing consistent biocontrol activity of P. protegens against A. flavus population and aflatoxin production in stored rice grains under various environmental conditions of temperature and RH."
