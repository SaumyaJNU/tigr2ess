Here, we quantified the activities of enzymes involved in starch metabolization in rice to investigate the mechanisms regulating the accumulation and translocation of stem non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) under different levels of nitrogen fertilizer application. A pot experiment was conducted using two rice cultivars, Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ) and Shanyou63 (SY63), under high and low nitrogen applications. Compared with high nitrogen application (HN), low nitrogen application (LN) increased stem NSC concentration before the heading stage and NSC translocation during the grain filling stage; concomitantly, LN significantly shortened the active grain filling period and increased the grain filling rate in superior spikelets. Compared with the LYPJ cultivar, SY63 exhibited a higher grain weight, higher grain filling percentage, and higher stem NSC concentration before heading and greater NSC translocation after heading. During the period between panicle initiation and heading, the activities of adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP), starch synthase (StS), and starch branching enzyme (SBE), all enzymes involved in starch synthesis, increased under the LN treatment and positively correlated with increases in stem NSC. During grain filling, the activities of enzymes involved in starch-to-sucrose conversion [&#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS)] increased under the LN treatment and positively correlated with stem NSC remobilization. Overall, the investigated enzymes exhibited higher activities in SY63 than in LYPJ. Our results suggest that low nitrogen increases the activities of AGP, StS, SBE, &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and SPS, leading to increased accumulation and remobilization of stem starch and NSC in SY63. We conclude that calculated reductions in nitrogen application and the choice of an appropriate cultivar may improve rice grain yields via enhanced stem NSC accumulation and translocation, thereby reducing the costs and increasing the sustainability of rice production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitrogen application</kwd><kwd>starch-metabolizing enzymes</kwd><kwd>non-structural carbohydrates</kwd><kwd>grain filling</kwd><kwd>rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) provides 35&#x02013;60% of the calories consumed by the more than 4 billion inhabitants of Asia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fageria, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yorobe et al., 2016</xref>). Growing populations, climate change (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>), and limits on the availability of arable land (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Beddington, 2010</xref>) make it increasingly difficult to meet food demands and under the changing climate currently (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). It&#x02019;s not viable to improve rice yield through the expansion of arable land in the future; future efforts to meet rising food demands must therefore rely on maximizing rice yields.</p><p>The emergence of new rice varieties through breeding has raised rice yield potential to unprecedented levels. High-yield varieties include those developed by the International Rice Research Institute, such as hybrid rice and &#x0201c;super&#x0201d; rice (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2008</xref>). These cultivars, however, frequently do not reach expected yields because of poor rice grain filling. Grain filling in rice depends on carbon assimilation in photosynthetic leaves and the remobilization of NSC temporarily stored in leaf sheaths and culms prior to heading. NSC stored in stems contributes an estimated 1&#x02013;28% to rice yields (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Improvements in the accumulation of NSC in stems and their translocation to rice grains increases sink capacity, grain filling rates, and grain yields (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms of stem NSC accumulation and translocation to maximize rice yield potentials and increase future rice yields.</p><p>Environmental factors influence the accumulation and translocation of stem NSC in rice. NSC translocation from stems increased during periods of environmental stress, such as high or low solar radiation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Okawa et al., 2003</xref>), heat stress (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Morita and Nakano, 2011</xref>), and water deficiency (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001a</xref>), when conditions caused photosynthesis to decrease. Nitrogen (N) plays a role in many physiological processes in crops, including photosynthesis and assimilate allocation, plant growth and development, and grain yield (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mae, 1997</xref>). The accumulation and translocation of stem NSC has been closely associated with the rate and timing of nitrogen applications, and low nitrogen conditions have increased stem NSC accumulation and translocation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Excessive nitrogen applications are not conducive to NSC accumulation and translocation and do not result in maximum yields (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2001</xref>). Although the activities of starch metabolizing enzymes have been shown to be influenced by the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to crops, the activity of SBE, which is important for starch accumulation during the heading period, decreased under high-nitrogen conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, N-starvation induced the expression of genes encoding starch synthesis enzymes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dian et al., 2003</xref>). These reports suggest that N supply affects starch synthesis by altering the expression and activity of the starch metabolizing enzymes involved in NSC accumulation and translocation. However, we do not yet have a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects.</p><p>N fertilizers are often applied to achieve high grain yields, but excess N can also produce negative consequences, such as low nitrogen-use efficiency, environmental pollution and water eutrophication, diminishing economic returns on the amount of fertilizers applied, poor quality of the rice grains produced, and reduced grain yields due to pest damage (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2002</xref>). Studies have shown that appropriate reductions in nitrogen fertilizer applications may still maintain the balance between grain yields and nitrogen-use efficiency (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ju and Christie, 2011</xref>). It is possible to reduce environmental risks by improving N management in intensive Chinese agricultural systems (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2009</xref>). <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Zhang (2007)</xref> proposed the development of green super rice, which produces high yields even with low inputs of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, promising to reduce the consumption of chemical fertilizers. Sustainable agricultural systems demand reduced N application and can be achieved by developing high yield crops and management practices that are less dependent on heavy fertilizer application.</p><p>Starch, the main storage form of NSC in the parenchyma cells of leaf sheaths and culms, accumulates during the vegetative growth stage of rice plants and decreases sharply during grain filling (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ishimaru et al., 2007</xref>). During starch accumulation in rice stems before heading, the enzymes AGP (Enzyme Commission number 2.7.7.27), StS (EC 2.4.1.21), and SBE (EC 2.4.1.18) play key roles in the regulation of starch synthesis (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Keeling and Myers, 2010</xref>). Starch levels in leaf sheaths and culms have been observed to parallel StS activity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Perez et al., 1971</xref>) and starch accumulation in leaf sheaths correlate with AGP and SBE activities and mRNA levels (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>After heading, stem starch is the first NSC source to be converted to sucrose, the primary sugar transported from source to sink in most plants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2014</xref>). Starch is primarily hydrolyzed by &#x003b1;-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) and &#x003b2;-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ishimaru et al., 2004</xref>). During the post-anthesis stage, increased gene expression and activity of &#x003b1;-amylase contributes to rapid starch degradation and increased remobilization from rice stems (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sugimura et al., 2015</xref>). SPS (EC 2.4.1.14) and sucrose synthase (SS; EC 2.4.1.13) are the primary enzymes involved in sucrose synthesis (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wardlaw and Willenbrink, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lunn and MacRae, 2003</xref>), while SS and invertase (acid and neutral invertase; EC 3.2.1.26) are the primary enzymes involved in sucrose degradation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lowell et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The enzymes involved in sucrose synthesis and degradation regulate the sucrose content of stems and NSC translocation from stems to developing grains post-anthesis.</p><p>Different rice cultivars display large variations in their capacities for NSC accumulation in, and translocation from, stems. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Fujita and Yoshida (1984)</xref> reported that NSC levels in leaf sheaths and culms of tall and short rice varieties were significantly different. Genotypes with high grain weights also exhibit a higher level of stem NSC translocation to the panicle than genotypes with lower grain weights (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Samonte et al., 2001</xref>). The contribution of stem NSC to final grain yield is an estimated 10&#x02013;40% in rice (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2010a</xref>). Among recombinant inbred rice lines from Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the contribution of NSC to grain yield ranged from 1 to 28% under low nitrogen and 1&#x02013;15% under normal nitrogen treatments (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). These reports demonstrate that stem NSC translocation and contribution to grain yield depends on genotype. However, the underlying mechanisms for these genotypic differences remain unknown.</p><p>Rice plants often accumulate NSC before anthesis, which contributes to grain filling post-anthesis via NSC translocation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). NSC translocation from stems to grains under low N application levels may partially meet plant demands for assimilates during grain development (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2015</xref>). However, we need an improved understanding of the physiological effects of LN on the regulation of stem NSC accumulation and translocation. In the current study, we conducted pot experiments using two rice cultivars to identify the activities of enzymes involved in starch &#x02013; sucrose conversion, which regulate stem NSC accumulation and translocation in rice under different nitrogen application levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title><p>Two rice cultivars, Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. ssp. <italic>indica</italic>) and Shanyou63 (SY63, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. ssp. <italic>indica</italic>), were used in a pot experiment at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. LYPJ and SY63 were two elite rice hybrids that were widely planted in China (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2017</xref>), with significant genetic variations in grain filling percentage and grain weight (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2010b</xref>). Compared with LYPJ (two-line hybrid), SY63 (three-line hybrid) had higher grain filling percentages and grain weights of whole panicle (8.6 and 8.7%), superior spikelets (4.4 and 1.7%), and inferior spikelets (14.4 and 18.5%), respectively (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2010b</xref>).</p><p>Germinated seeds were seeded to nursery plates containing sandy loam soil on 23 May 2015. On 17 June 2015, three uniform, 25-day-old seedlings were transplanted into each of 72, 12.0 L pots (diameter 24.5 cm; height 25.5 cm) filled with 10.0 kg soil. The soil used was a clay type soil and had the following properties: pH 7.1, 7.0 g organic matter kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.07 g total N kg<sup>-1</sup>, 6.3 mg Olsen P kg<sup>-1</sup>, and 127.0 mg exchangeable K kg<sup>-1</sup>. Considering that the main objective of the study was to investigate the underlying mechanism for regulation of N application rates on stem carbohydrates accumulation and translocation, the two N treatments were used, between which was 10 times differences, with the purpose of making significant differences in physiological traits in response to N application rates. Namely, low N and high N application rates were 0.26 g N pot<sup>-1</sup> (LN) and 2.6 g N pot<sup>-1</sup> (HN) in the form of urea, which were equal to N application rates of 21 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> and 210 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> in farmer field, respectively. Each N treatment and each cultivar was repeated three times. The nitrogen fertilizer applications were split-applied at a ratio of 4:3:3 at three different times: basal (1 day before transplanting), tillering stage (approximately 36 days after germination), and at panicle initiation (approximately 66 days after germination). Phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) in the form of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> were applied as basal fertilizers at rates of 1.50 and 1.89 g pot<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Basal fertilizers were applied by thorough mixing into the soil before transplanting; subsequent fertilizers were applied in a top-dressed manner by dissolving them in water and then irrigating. Eighteen pots were used for each of the four treatments testing rice variety and N level, for a total of 72 pots. During the entire experiment, plants received well water, maintaining a water depth of at least 2 cm. Pests and diseases were controlled using chemical pesticides.</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling for Dynamic Changes in Enzyme Activity and Sugar Content in Stems</title><p>Upon panicle initiation (PI, approximately 66 days after germination) when the average length of young panicles was about 1 mm (as determined by checking several young panicles under a magnifier), several main and large stems were chosen and tagged for each treatment. Panicles from main or large stems that flowered on the same day were chosen and tagged on the heading date (HD, approximately 96 days after germination). Six tagged main or large stems (culms and sheaths) from six plants in each treatment were sampled at 5-day or 6-day intervals from panicle initiation to maturity. Considering the effect of plant number on available N for each plant and experiment scale, only two large stems were tagged from each plant from the same pot for sampling, one for each time point. After the two samplings, the plants were not used for any other sampling.</p><p>Three sampled stems were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80&#x000b0;C for determination of enzyme activity. The other stems were oven-dried at 80&#x000b0;C to constant weight and ground for the measurement of soluble sugars, starch, and sucrose. In total, we collected six samplings for measuring enzyme activity during the PI stage (day of PI, and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 26 days after PI) and six samplings for measuring enzyme activity between heading and maturity (day of heading, and 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 days after heading).</p></sec><sec><title>Sampling for Grain Filling Rate and Grain Yield</title><p>During the spikelet ontogeny, superior spikelets are often referred to ones located on apical primary branches, and flower first and fill fast; inferior spikelets located on proximal secondary branches often have hysteretic nature of grain filling and fill slowly (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). After heading, three tagged panicles were sampled at 4-day intervals until maturity, and then superior and inferior spikelets were separately collected for determination of grain filling, respectively. All superior and inferior spikelets were oven-dried at 80&#x000b0;C to a constant weight and weighed. The active grain filling period (number of days) was defined as the period of time that grain weight was between 5% (t1) and 95% (t2) of final grain weight. The average grain filling rate (mg grain<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) was calculated between t1 and t2 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At both heading and maturity, three entire plants per treatment were sampled and separated into leaves, stems (culms and sheaths), and panicles. All spikelets of the panicles were hand-threshed at maturity. Filled grains and unfilled grains were divided by submersing them in tap water. Empty grains were separated from unfilled grains using a seed winnowing cleanliness instrument. The dry weights of all parts, including leaves, stems, rachises, and spikelets were weighed after being oven-dried at 80&#x000b0;C to a constant weight. The numbers of filled, partially filled, and empty grains were counted, and the 1000-grain weight (g) and percentages of half-filled and fully-filled grains (%) were calculated. Biomass (g plant<sup>-1</sup>) was the total dry weight of the aboveground plant parts, grain yield (g plant<sup>-1</sup>) was the weight of full-filled grains, and harvest index (%) was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield to the biomass.</p><p>To determine the contribution of stem NSC to grain yield, stems were ground and measured for contents of soluble sugars, starch, and sucrose.</p></sec><sec><title>Assays for Soluble Sugars, Starch, and Sucrose in Stems</title><p>Soluble sugars and starch were determined according to the method described by <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al.

Under the HN condition, rice plants required more carbohydrates to build plant structures and more carbon to transform inorganic nitrogen, which could cause decreases in stem NSC at heading (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gebbing et al., 1999</xref>). In rice, starch is the main form of stem NSC before heading (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ishimaru et al., 2007</xref>); so, enzymes for starch synthesis may be involved in the process of starch accumulation. In our study, LN treatment also increased the activities of AGP, StS, and SBE enzymes before heading, which are involved in starch synthesis in stems (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>) and varied in consistency with changes in starch and NSC concentrations (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref></bold>).

These results suggest that enhanced activities of AGP, StS, and SBE under LN may directly lead to increases in starch and NSC concentrations in stems before heading. <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al. (2005)</xref> found that low SBE activity, due to decreased expression of SBE genes, contributed to decreased starch accumulation in leaf sheaths under HN conditions. Additionally, studies have found that the activities of AGP, StS, and SBE are enhanced by water stress during the period of rapid starch accumulation in rice grains; changes in the activities of these enzymes may be an adaptive mechanism to alleviate assimilate deficiencies in times of environmental stress (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, the LN condition enhanced the activities of AGP, StS, and SBE, resulting in increased starch accumulation prior to heading. While it is clear that the LN condition creates a lower demand for carbohydrates by rice plants, due to slow growth and less transformation of inorganic nitrogen, the mechanisms underlying the effects of low N on NSC accumulation should be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Low Nitrogen Increased Stem NSC Translocation by Enhancing Activities of Enzymes Involved in Starch-to-Sucrose Conversion</title><p>Low nitrogen application increased stem NSC translocation during grain filling (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), this result is in accordance with <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al.

In fact, starch and NSC concentrations decreased more quickly and to a greater degree under LN compared with HN (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref></bold>), indicating higher starch and NSC remobilization from stems to grains under LN. It has been reported that the remobilization of stem NSC closely correlates with senescence; plants experiencing severe senescence due to environmental stress, such as water stress or LN versus HN, exhibit a greater degree of starch and NSC remobilization than plants experiencing a lower degree of senescence (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001c</xref>). Previous studies have shown that water deficits increased the translocation of NSC to grains in wheat (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Plaut et al., 2004</xref>) and rice (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001c</xref>) and that the cause was likely due to the enhanced activities of enzymes involved in starch hydrolysis and sucrose synthesis in stems (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001a</xref>). The activities of three enzymes involved in starch-to-sucrose conversion (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-amylase for hydrolysis of starch, SPS for sucrose synthesis) correlated with the concentrations of soluble sugars and sucrose during the grain filling period (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). The increased activities of these enzymes also appeared to enhance remobilization of stem starch and NSC (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>), which was supported by the positive correlation of the activities with the decrease in starch and NSC in stems during grain filling under the LN treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref></bold>). Although &#x003b2;-amylase activity was lower than &#x003b1;-amylase activity for the duration of the grain filling stage (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>), &#x003b2;-amylase activity correlated more closely with starch and NSC remobilization (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A,B,D,E</xref></bold>). &#x003b2;-amylase is thought to hydrolyze the oligosaccharide products of &#x003b1;-amylase and plays an important role in the regulation of starch hydrolysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 1997</xref>). These results suggest that the rapid hydrolysis of starch under LN can be attributed to increased &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-amylase activities in stems.</p><p>Sucrose is the primary form in which photoassimilates are transported in plants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2014</xref>). Rapid synthesis of sucrose, which involves the SPS and SSs enzymes, reduces concentrations of monosaccharides (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wardlaw and Willenbrink, 1994</xref>). The LN treatment enhanced SPS activity in stems during grain filling, which correlated closely with increased sucrose concentrations in stems (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>); this result is consistent with previous research showing that SPS is a key enzyme in sucrose synthesis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lunn and MacRae, 2003</xref>). In addition, SPS activity correlated significantly with the remobilization of starch and NSC in stems under both N application treatments during the grain filling stage (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C,F</xref></bold>). In contrast, the activity of SSs decreased gradually from heading to maturity and was not affected by N treatment; however, SSs activity was higher than SPS and remained at a high level during grain filling (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>), a state which is beneficial for sucrose synthesis. Overall, N treatment had no effect on the activities of enzymes involved in sucrose hydrolysis (AI, NI, and SSc) in stems; the activities of these enzymes were relatively low and decreased gradually during grain filling (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref></bold>). This suggests that AI, NI, and SSc had little effect on sucrose synthesis and the remobilization of stem starch and NSC. Based on these findings, we conclude that high activities of &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and SPS are the main contributors to increases in the remobilization of starch and NSC in rice stems under LN during grain filling.</p><p>It was noteworthy that superior spikelet had faster grain filling rate and shorter active grain filling period under LN (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The observation was in accordance with <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2006)</xref>. However, LN had no significant effects on grain filling of inferior spikelets in our study; the similar observations were found in wheat under LN (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Due to spikelet ontogeny and flowering time, superior spikelets often show the dominance for competing carbohydrates relatively to inferior ones, resulting in the quick and early grain filling (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, later-flowering inferior spikelets had the nature of hysteretic and slow grain filling; therefore, effect of nitrogen on grain filling of inferior spikelets may be diminished, especially when photosynthetic rate and available assimilates for grain filling decrease due to low N application rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotypic Differences in Activities of Enzymes Involved in Starch Metabolization Influence NSC Accumulation and Translocation</title><p>Rice cultivars have shown large genotypic differences in their abilities to accumulate and translocate stem NSC (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Samonte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). The differences in stem NSC accumulation and translocation were also observed between LYPJ and SY63 (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). Higher activities of AGP, StS, and SBE for starch synthesis in stems contributed to the higher stem starch and NSC concentrations in SY63. This result was also supported by the positive correlations between the activities of the three enzymes and the increases in starch and NSC concentrations in the two varieties in present study (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>). Additionally, AGP and StS activities in both cultivars correlated significantly with increases in stem starch and NSC concentrations under both N application treatments (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref></bold>); however, SY63 exhibited strong correlations between SBE activity and increases in starch (<italic>r</italic> = 0.97, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 4) and NSC (<italic>r</italic> = 0.97, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 4) under both N applications. and no such correlations were observed between SBE activity and increases in starch and NSC for the LYPJ cultivar (for starch under LN: <italic>r</italic> = 0.18, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; for starch under HN: <italic>r</italic> = 0.71, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; for NSC under LN: <italic>r</italic> = 0.18, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; for NSC under LN, <italic>r</italic> = 0.68, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Among the starch-synthesis-related enzymes (AGP, StS, and SBE), SBE activity exhibited the highest positive correlation with starch concentration (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>), and SBE expression correlated with starch concentration (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hirose et al., 1999</xref>). Additionally, the photosynthetic rate of LYPJ is higher than that of SY63 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lv et al., 2017</xref>); however, LYPJ had low stem NSC and starch accumulation under both N application rates (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref></bold>). These results suggest that higher activities of AGP, StS, and SBE may contribute to higher stem starch and NSC concentrations in SY63 than LYPJ and that SBE may contribute more strongly to pre-anthesis starch and NSC accumulation in the stems of SY63 than LYPJ.</p><p>Stem NSC is an important source of assimilates used for grain filling; a high level of stem NSC at the full heading stage was found capable of maintaining enhanced sink strength and highly ripened grains (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Morita and Nakano, 2011</xref>). Grain yield, grain weight, and grain filling percentage are closely associated with stem NSC concentration and translocation (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). SY63 had a significantly higher grain filling rate of superior spikelets and grain yield than LYPJ, especially under LN (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,D,F</xref></bold>). Our study and <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang (2010b)</xref> suggest that better grain filling was partly attributed to higher NSC translocation. High activities of &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and SPS may be responsible for greater remobilization of starch and NSC in SY63 than in LYPJ, which is beneficial for grain filling after heading.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculated Reductions in Nitrogen Application May Enhance Stem NSC Accumulation and Translocation</title><p>Nitrogen fertilizer application rate has crucial roles in biomass accumulation and grain yield formation. However, increasing fertilization generally result in gradual reduction in the crop yield response (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Sui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lassaletta et al., 2014</xref>). We noticed that the N treatments were 10 times difference between the two N rates (0.26 vs. 2.6 g N pot<sup>-1</sup>); however, the biomass and grain yield increased approximately twice between the N treatments (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>), suggesting that the differences in biomass and grain yields between LN and HN were not linearly proportionate with the increase of N application rates. The relationship between N application rate and grain yield in our study was in accordance with lots of previous studies in pot and field experiments. <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al. (2015a)</xref> reported that grain yield was 2.0&#x0223c;2.3 times higher under HN (3.5 g N pot<sup>-1</sup>) than LN (0.5 g N pot<sup>-1</sup>) in three rice varieties; Similarly, field experiment data of <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2015)</xref> also showed that biomass and grain yield under HN (225 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>) were 1.7 and 1.5 times higher than those under LN (0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. So, the large increases in N application rates do not always result in large differences accordingly in biomass and grain yields. In fact, the responses of rice plant biomass and grain yield to N application rates may be not accumulative, and is associated with several factors, such as soil indigenous nitrogen content (soil fertility), genetic characteristics of cultivars, climate factors (radiation and temperature), cultivation managements.</p><p>The pursuit of higher rice yields often prompts the application of additional nitrogen fertilizers in many rice planting regions (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Chen, 2002</xref>), resulting in an estimated 30% overuse of nitrogen in agricultural fields in China (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ju and Gu, 2014</xref>). Besides negative consequences for the environment, nitrogen use efficiency, crop health, and grain yields (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Peng, 2014</xref>), excess nitrogen application is not conducive to NSC accumulation and translocation, nor to high yields (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Our study supports these observations by showing that HN resulted in lower stem NSC accumulation and translocation than LN (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>), LN enhanced grain filling percentage and harvest index (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref></bold>), which may be attributed to the increased stem NSC translocation(<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref></bold>). Although our study showed that grain yield significantly decreased under LN (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref></bold>), investigations by the International Rice Research Institute since 1997 have shown that appropriate reductions in nitrogen fertilizer application can simultaneously increase grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency and reach optimal productivity (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2002</xref>). According to our study (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>) and reports of <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al. (2015)</xref>, LN may enhance stem NSC accumulation and remobilization, which is often beneficial for grain yield in rice. Additionally, according to the yield-nitrogen application rate relationship (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Sui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lassaletta et al., 2014</xref>), response of crop grain yield to N application gradually reduces with the increase of N application rate, and the contributions of N application to yield formation often become smaller at high application rates than that at low application rates. Improving nitrogen management through crop rotation in agriculturally intensive systems in China may reduce current nitrogen application rates by 30&#x02013;60%, while preserving current crop yields and a healthy nitrogen balance (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that it is feasible to reduce nitrogen application by using rice varieties with lower nitrogen demands, which can produce high yields even under stressful growth conditions and contribute to agricultural sustainability.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the current study, LN increased the concentrations of starch and NSC in rice stems before the plants&#x02019; heading stage. This was primarily attributed to the enhanced activities of AGP, StS, and SBE enzymes in plant stems. Reduced N application also resulted in increased activities of &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and SPS, which increased the remobilization of stem starch and NSC; these effects increase grain filling percentage, grain filling rate, and harvest index in rice. In terms of cultivar genotype, higher activities of AGP, StS, and SBE were responsible for higher concentrations of stem starch and NSC in the SY63 rice cultivar than in the LYPJ cultivar prior to heading; SBE played a larger role in the regulation of starch and NSC in SY63 than in LYPJ. In addition, SY63 exhibited higher activities of &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and SPS, which increased stem starch and NSC translocation; these effects increase grain filling percentage, grain filling rate, grain weight, and grain yield in SY63. Our results suggest that calculated reductions in nitrogen application may improve grain yields via enhanced stem NSC accumulation and translocation, thereby reducing the costs and increasing the sustainability of rice production.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>GL and KC conceived the research, designed the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
