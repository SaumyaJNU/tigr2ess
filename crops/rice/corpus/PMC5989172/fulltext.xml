Introduction</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is the most important stable food crop that feeds more than two billion people worldwide. It is a warm season plant that is sensitive to cold, and its growth and production are severely affected by low temperatures [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cold stress inhibits rice growth during all growth stages, ranging from vegetative to reproductive stages. During early vegetative stages, cold stress severely inhibits rice growth, such as seedling growth retardation, plant height, and tiller number reduction [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the reproductive stage, cold stress causes delayed heading, incomplete panicle exertion, pollen sterility, poor grain filling, reduction of seed setting rates, and finally causes yield reduction [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Plants have evolved efficient mechanisms to tolerate low temperature stress. The cold tolerance genes can be divided into three kinds according to the low temperature signal transduction pathway, including protein kinase genes, transcription factors, and functional genes. ICE-CBF-COR pathway plays an important role in plant resistance to cold stress [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A large number of genes called cold-responsive gene (COR) can be induced by cold stress. The C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) proteins regulate the COR gene expression by binding to C-repeat/dehydration-responsive (CRT/DRE) element. ICE is a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcriptional activator, which can specifically bind to a specific CBF promoter sequence at low temperatures and induces the expression of CBF genes, thus improving the cold resistance [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At present, there are three <italic>CBF</italic> genes related to chilling injury in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, including <italic>CBF1</italic>, <italic>CBF2</italic>, and <italic>CBF3</italic> [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, many scientists have isolated CBF-like genes [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in rice. Wang et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that <italic>OsDREB1F</italic> transcription factors in rice could specifically bind to <italic>cis</italic>-acting element CRT/DRE and were induced by low temperature, salt, drought, and ABA. Ito et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed that <italic>OsDREB1</italic> transgenic rice plants had obvious improvement in the characteristics of low temperature, salt resistance, and drought resistance. Chen et al. [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that the expression of <italic>OsDREBL</italic> gene was enhanced at low temperature. Nakamura [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the expression of <italic>OsICE1</italic> and <italic>OsICE2</italic> was enhanced at low temperature, and also <italic>OsDREB1B</italic>, <italic>OsHsfA3</italic> (rice heat shock factor A3), and <italic>OsTPP1</italic> rice genes were expressed in its transgenic rice.</p><p>Zinc finger proteins play a crucial role in resisting environmental stresses in various plants [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on the sequence characteristics of the conserved domain of zinc finger proteins, they can be divided into six groups: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H, C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>20</sub>/AN<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>HC<sub>4</sub>. The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc finger protein family (also called TFIIIA-type) is one of the largest families of eukaryotic transcription factors, which have one to four finger motif(s) within each molecule and also contain a conserved QALGGH sequence within their zinc finger domain [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins can function as a key transcriptional regulator involved in regulating various developmental processes or responses to abiotic stresses [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Overexpression of the tomato C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein transcription factor, <italic>SlCZFP1</italic>, confers enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. GsZFP1, a new C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc finger protein, is a positive regulator of plant tolerance to cold and drought stress, and <italic>GsZFP1</italic>-overexpressing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in a greater tolerance to cold and drought stress [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Rice zinc finger protein ZFP245 [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein ZFP182 [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] were induced by various abiotic stresses, and overexpression of these proteins significantly enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerances, including salt, cold, and drought tolerances in transgenic rice. Overexpression of rice zinc finger protein OsCOIN increased tolerance to chilling, salt, and drought stress and also enhanced proline level in rice [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, transcription factors are powerful tools for genetic engineering, as their overexpression can lead to upregulation of an array of genes under their control [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Rice plants are more sensitive to cold stress at the booting stages than at the seedling stages [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Discovery of genes affecting cold tolerance at the booting stage will be helpful for developing cold tolerance cultivars and improve grain yield. Cold tolerance segregating populations are usually used for mapping and cloning genes for cold tolerance. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase CTB4a which conferred cold tolerance at the booting stage was mapped and cloned [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Saito et al. mapped and cloned the QTL <italic>Ctb1</italic> encoding an F-box protein which contributed to normal anther development under cold stress [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Zhou et al. [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] fine mapped <italic>qCTB7</italic> for cold tolerance at the booting stage on rice chromosome 7 using a near-isogenic rice. Kuroki et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] mapped <italic>qCTB8</italic> for cold tolerance at the booting stage on rice chromosome 8.</p><p>Pollen fertilities are an important indicator of cold resistance evaluation at the reproductive stage and can be determined after cold-water treatments by obtaining pollen from spikelets and staining with 1% iodine-potassium iodide (I<sub>2</sub>-KI) [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In general, the seed setting rates of plants stressed by naturally low temperatures or artificially controlled low temperatures are the most important index to evaluate the cold tolerance at the booting stage in rice [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, physiological and biochemical indices such as osmolytes and chlorophyll, reduced reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde are also utilized as cold tolerance indicators [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In many genetic studies, genetic variation of rice varieties and agronomic trait-related correlation analysis are utilized to evaluate cold tolerance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies have suggested the involvement of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein in abiotic stress responses, their precise biological function and molecular mechanism remain to be further elucidated. In the present study, we report on the identification of OsCTZFP8, a novel zinc finger protein transcription factor in rice. We found that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> expression was induced by cold stress, and its overexpression in transgenic rice enhanced cold tolerance during the reproductive stage. Our results indicated that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> might have an important role in cold tolerance in rice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Isolation and Sequence Analyses of OsCTZFP8</title><p>In our previous work, we mapped a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance during the reproductive stage on rice chromosome 8 and delimited it to a 99.4&#x02009;kb region (our unpublished data). Fourteen putative genes were located in this region, and only LOC_Os08g20580 was considered to be the cold tolerance candidate gene by bioinformatics analyses. LOC_Os08g20580 was predicted to be encoded with a zinc finger protein transcription factor and then was designated as OsCTZFP8 (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cold tolerance zinc finger protein in chromosome 8) by us. OsCTZFP8 is 225 amino acids long and contains one C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger domain with a plant-specific QALGGH motif as well as a conserved leucine-rich motif (L-box) and contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) with a consensus sequence of KRKRSRR (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). Comparisons of the amino acid sequences between OsCTZFP8 and other C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein homologs in plants (<italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>Zea mays</italic>, <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) showed that the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger domains were highly conservative in these plant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). To investigate the evolutionary relationship among plant C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins involved in stress responses, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with full-length amino acid sequences. The results showed that OsCTZFP8 was clustered on the same branch with nine C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins from monocotyledonous plants, which distinguished them from dicotyledonous species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Promoter analysis of the 2&#x02009;kb <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> promoter region using the PLACE software program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/signalscan.html">http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/signalscan.html</ext-link>) found that it contained a low-temperature responsiveness (LTR) <italic>cis</italic>-acting element and abscisic acid responsive element (ABRE).

Based on these observations, we speculated that OsCTZFP8 might confer abiotic stress tolerance in rice.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Transcriptional Expression of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic></title><p>To investigate the possible involvement of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> in environmental stress responses, qRT-PCR was performed with 2-week-old rice plants exposed to cold, ABA, and NaCl treatments at different time points. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, transcription of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was induced by all three stresses; however, the induction showed different kinetic patterns among shoots and roots. In shoots, the transcription level of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was significantly elevated under cold and NaCl treatments, whereas it was induced weakly under ABA treatments: <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was induced by cold and reached a maximum (~6-fold) at 5&#x02009;h and induced ~4-fold within 24&#x02009;h under NaCl treatment; however, it was only increased up to ~3-fold in 24&#x02009;h under ABA treatment. In roots, <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was induced weakly under ABA, NaCl, and cold treatments compared to the NT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

OsCTZFP8 Is a Nuclear Protein and Has Transactivation Activity</title><p>The deduced OsCTZFP8 protein contains a stretch of basic residues KRKRSRR, which may function as a potential NLS. To determine the subcellular localization of OsCTZFP8, OsCTZFP8 was fused to the 5&#x02032; end of the soluble-modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP) gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, the fusion protein, CaMV35S::OsCTZFP8-smGFP, was localized predominantly to the nucleus of onion cells, whereas CaMV35S::smGFP alone was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

FULL, NTR, and CTR of OsCTZFP8 were fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and then cotransformed with the <italic>Lac</italic>Z reporter into yeast cells. The results showed that FULL and CTR of OsCTZFP8 displayed transactivation activity; however, NTR had no transactivation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>).

Overexpression of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> Improves Cold Tolerance of Transgenic Rice</title><p>To examine whether <italic>OsCTZFP8-</italic>overexpressing rice confers for cold tolerance, cold treatments were performed using <italic>OsCTZFP8-</italic>overexpressing lines and NT control plants.

Under normal conditions, all pollen grains of <italic>OsCTZFP8-</italic>overexpressing line (OE-1-6 and OE-3-2) and NT control plants were stained dark blue with no significant differences between them, exhibiting approximately 98% of pollen fertilities. Under cold treatments, more than three quarters of the pollen in OE-1-6 and OE-3-2 were stained dark blue, which explained 76~81% of fertility, whereas less than half the pollen of NT control plants were stained dark blue and others were stained reddish brown, resulting in only approximately 41% of fertilities (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(b)</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors are usually thought to be involved in plant development and have various adaptive responses to environmental stress [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, we characterized a new C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factor <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> from rice. Sequence analyses revealed that OsCTZFP8 had high identity with other C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins and shared one zinc finger motif containing a conserved plant-specific QALGGH amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>), which has been proven to be critical for DNA-binding activity [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, the C-terminus of the <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> gene contains a typical L-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>), which plays roles in protein interactions or maintaining the folded structure [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that OsCTZFP8 was clustered on the same branch as nine C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins from monocotyledonous plants, which distinguished it from dicotyledonous species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>). This indicated that dicotyledonous plants and monocotyledon plants have differences in genetic characteristics of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins and probably play different regulation roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Subcellular localization assay and yeast one-hybrid analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) revealed that OsCTZFP8 was a nuclear protein and has transcriptional activation activity, implying that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was a transcription factor.</p><p>The promoter region of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> contains various abiotic stress-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements including LTR and ABRE, suggesting that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> might be upregulated by interacting with its upstream genes binding to these <italic>cis</italic>-elements. Accordingly, transcript expression analysis revealed that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> was differentially induced by several stresses such as cold, ABA, and high salinity, particularly, strongly elevated in response to cold stress. These results suggest that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> might be involved in cold stress responses in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To gain more knowledge regarding the function of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>, full-length coding sequence (CDS) of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> from rice was cloned by reverse transcription and <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing rice driven by the maize Ubi promoter was constructed by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>). The <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> gene was stably integrated into the rice genome as confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis using T<sub>0</sub> transgenic plants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(e)</xref>). In addition, single-copy insertion lines were selected by Southern blot analysis to maintain stability of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> inheritance and convenience of homozygous selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(e)</xref>). Selection of single-copy insertion transgenic plants is important for transgenic breeding, because multiple gene copies can lead to instability of expression and inheritance of the transgene even gene silencing [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Transcription levels of <italic>OsCTZFP</italic>8 were accumulated higher in single-copy insertion overexpressing lines than in NT rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(f)</xref>), indicating that the <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> gene was overexpressed successfully and gene silencing did not occur in transcription levels. When using Basta resistance segregation analyses, two homozygous lines from single-copy insertion transgenic lines were finally selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(g)</xref>). Homozygous lines can stably maintain consistency of genetic and phenotypic characters and accelerate the generation process and reduce workload [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>To effectively and correctly evaluate cold tolerance, factors such as cold stress temperature and duration of stress exposure, phase of the developmental stage, and phenotypic indices must be considered when defining a treatment method. When choosing a cold-water temperature for tolerance evaluations, it is important to consider that low temperatures allow for the identification of the highest levels of tolerance and high temperatures help identify moderate tolerance. It has been reported that cold-water temperature was determined ranging from 15 to 19&#x000b0;C with a depth of 5 to 20&#x02009;cm for different cold tolerance evaluation purposes [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our cold-water treatment facility, the temperature of the cold water was controlled reliably because cold water was obtained from aquifers and cooled by an electrical cooling system based on the water temperature sensing system in the nursery. Under cold treatments, pollen fertilities of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing lines were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) higher than NT control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with this, seed setting rates of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing lines were significantly higher than those of the NT control plants (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) under cold treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, the yield per plant of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing lines was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) higher than that of NT control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). All these results confirmed that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing lines increased tolerance to cold stress during the reproductive stage, indicating that <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> plays a role in cold stress response.</p><p>Transcription factor is a critical component of the gene regulatory networks that plays a central role in response to abiotic stress. It regulates expression of a number of stress-responsive genes to cope with stress [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. To better understand the molecular role of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> in cold tolerance responses, it would be useful to identify downstream target genes and interaction proteins by transcriptome sequencing and yeast two-hybrid system as well as their expression changes in <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic>-overexpressing plants compared with NT control plants.</p><p>In summary, the present study identified a new zinc finger transcription factor OsCTZFP8 in rice that can be induced by various abiotic stresses. Overexpression of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> in rice can improve cold tolerance during the reproductive stage by enhancing pollen fertilities and seed setting rates as well as yield per plant, suggesting a promising utility of this gene in genetic improvement of cold tolerance. The molecular regulation mechanism of <italic>OsCTZFP8</italic> for cold tolerance and other abiotic stress tolerance could be further elucidated in the future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31400235), the National Novel Transgenic Organisms Breeding Project of China (2016ZX08001001-001-007), Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Project of China (20160204033NY), Jilin Provincial Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of China (CXGC2017TD009).</p></ack><sec><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>Wenzhu Jiang and Xiu-Feng Lin contributed equally to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Overexpression of ethylene response factor <italic>TERF2</italic> confers cold tolerance in rice seedlings</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Transgenic Research</italic></source><year>2011</year><volume>20</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>857</fpage><lpage>866</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s11248-010-9463-9</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-79960440691</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 21136294?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21136294</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Iba</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acclimative response to temperature stress in higher plants: approaches of gene engineering for temperature tolerance</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">Annual Review of Plant Biology</italic></source><year>2002</year><volume>53</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>225</fpage><lpage>245</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100201.160729</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-0037004330</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Genetic analysis of cold tolerance at the germination and booting stages in rice by association mapping</article-title><source><italic toggle="yes">PLoS One</italic></source><year>2015</year><volume>10</volume><issue>3, article e0120590</issue><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120590</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-84925639057</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 25790128?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25790128</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>D.
