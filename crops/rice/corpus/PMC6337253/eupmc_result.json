    "Branch number is one of the main factors affecting the yield of soybean (Glycine max (L.)). In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study combined with linkage analysis for the identification of a candidate gene controlling soybean branching. Five quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were associated with branch numbers in a soybean core collection. Among these QTNs, a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block qtnBR6-1 spanning 20 genes was found to overlap a previously identified major quantitative trait locus qBR6-1. To validate and narrow down qtnBR6-1, we developed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) harboring high-branching (HB) and low-branching (LB) alleles of qBR6-1, with 99.96% isogenicity and different branch numbers. A cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating between NIL-HB and NIL-LB was located within the qtnBR6-1 LD block. Among the five genes showing differential expression between NIL-HB and NIL-LB, BRANCHED1 (BRC1; Glyma.06G210600) was down-regulated in the shoot apex of NIL-HB, and one missense mutation and two SNPs upstream of BRC1 were associated with branch numbers in 59 additional soybean accessions. BRC1 encodes TEOSINTE-BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS 1 and 2 transcription factor and functions as a regulatory repressor of branching. On the basis of these results, we propose BRC1 as a candidate gene for branching in soybean."
