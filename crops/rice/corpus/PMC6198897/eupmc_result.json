    "An intergeneric hybrid was successfully developed between Oryza sativa L. (IRRI 154) and Leersia perrieri (A. Camus) Launert using embryo rescue technique in this study. A low crossability value (0.07%) implied that there was high incompatibility between the two species of the hybrid. The F1 hybrid showed intermediate phenotypic characteristics between the parents but the plant height was very short. The erect plant type resembled the female parent IRRI 154 but the leaves were similar to L. perrieri. Cytological analysis revealed highly non-homology between chromosomes of the two species as the F1 plants showed 24 univalents without any chromosome pairing. The F1 hybrid plant was further confirmed by PCR analysis using the newly designed 11 indel markers showing polymorphism between O. sativa and L. perrieri. This intergeneric hybrid will open up opportunities to transfer novel valuable traits from L. perrieri into cultivated rice."
