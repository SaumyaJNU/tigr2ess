Identifying alleles that improve panicle architecture would greatly aid the development of high-yield varieties. Here, we show that the quantitative trait locus <italic>qSrn7</italic> contains rice <italic>FRIZZY PANICLE</italic> (<italic>FZP</italic>), a previously reported gene encoding an ERF transcription factor that promotes floral transition. Reduced expression of <italic>FZP</italic> in the reproductive stage increases the extent of higher order branching of the panicle, resulting in increased grain number. Genotype analysis of this gene in cultivars from the publicly available National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) Core Collection demonstrated that the extent of higher order branching, especially in the upper panicle, was increased in those cultivars carrying the <italic>FZP</italic> allele associated with <italic>qSrn7</italic>. Furthermore, chromosome segment substitution lines resulting from a cross between Koshihikari and Kasalath, the latter of which carries <italic>qSrn7/FZP</italic>, also showed that upper panicle higher order branching and grain yield were increased by <italic>qSrn7/FZP</italic>.

Although these mutants are useful for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of panicle development, their applicability in agriculture is limited because they have abnormal plant architecture. By contrast, quantitative traits found in various rice cultivars are influenced by multiple alleles derived from the accumulation of natural mutations. Several of these alleles are associated with grain yield. A natural allele of <italic>DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1</italic> (<italic>DEP1</italic>) was shown to influence panicle architecture, resulting in reduced panicle internode length and increased grain number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, whereas <italic>Grain Number 1a</italic> (<italic>GN1a</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and <italic>WEALTHY FARMER&#x02019;S PANICLE</italic> (<italic>WFP</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> were shown to significantly increase PB number, grain number, and yield. These past studies have examined terminal phenotypes such as grain number and panicle length; however, panicle structure as determined by its branching pattern has not been characterized in detail, such as through comprehensive analysis of several organs.</p><p id="Par4">In the rice panicle, flower opening and grain filling occur in a sequential developmental process, which is initiated in the spikelet furthest from the rachis axis and proceeds inward. As a result, the position of a spikelet within a panicle determines the timing of both flower fertilization and grain development. Panicle size and branching pattern are thought to determine grain shape and quality directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. High-yield modern rice varieties have higher grain filling rate in upper areas of the panicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The rice panicle exhibits a recursive structure in which higher-order rachis branches radiate from lower-order rachis branches, which in turn radiate from the rachis. Therefore, knowledge of how the order of each rachis branch is affected by a particular gene will greatly assist in efforts to alter the architecture of the rachis for optimal yield. Furthermore, identifying a novel quantitative trait locus (QTL) that regulates these organs would assist in breeding new rice varieties with increased yields.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a major QTL, <italic>qSrn7</italic>, which regulates a novel panicle branching pattern in rice.

However, the function of <italic>GN1</italic> was characterized based on its effect on terminal phenotypes, such as grain number, which does not consider panicle branching pattern and panicle structure. Quantifying panicle traits tends to be laborious and time-consuming because of the large number of complex traits; however, several recent studies have been based on QTL or GWAS analyses using phenotype data collected with high-resolution panicle phenotyping software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, to our knowledge, further genes involved in panicle architecture have also not been thoroughly examined for their effects on panicle branching pattern using panicle trait analysis. In 1989, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) launched a breeding program for New Plant Type (NPT) rice to increase the yields of modern indica cultivars by incorporating genetic material from tropical japonica landraces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The NPT breeding program attempted to boost yield by simultaneously selecting for increased panicle size (sink) and photosynthetic capacity (source)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The NPT cultivar successfully generated large panicle phenotypes but had lower yields than modern indica cultivars, because it did not exhibit the desired combinations of sink and source traits that are characteristic of high-yielding varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This result suggests that physiologically optimizing panicle architecture for grain filling and yield will probably involve managing a highly interactive network or trait complex. Thus, analyses that consider complex panicle phenotypes are of great importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, as changes to panicle branching pattern and structure are associated with increases in grain yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, it is important to characterize how a particular gene affects the panicle branching pattern.</p><p id="Par15">Efforts to improve panicle grain number would benefit both from focusing on previously characterized genes that influence branching pattern and on identifying additional genes that influence panicle traits. To the best of our knowledge, genes that affect panicle branching pattern had not hitherto been identified. Therefore, we used a rice variety with increased panicle grain number to identify and characterize a gene involved in panicle branching pattern.</p><p id="Par16">Analysis of the QTL <italic>qSrn7</italic> revealed that the locus contains <italic>FZP</italic> and its maize ortholog <italic>BRANCHED SILKLESS 1</italic> (<italic>BD1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which encodes an AP2/ERF-type transcription factor. Furthermore, we showed that <italic>qSrn7</italic> in the existing variety ST-5 and in CSSLs using in this study (KKSLs carrying <italic>qSrn7</italic> from Kasalath) produced more SBs with attached filled grains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), and that the <italic>FZP</italic> expression level in spikelet meristems of these lines was slightly reduced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Our results suggest that <italic>qSrn7</italic> is a weakly active allele of <italic>FZP</italic>, which we denoted as <italic>qSrn7/FZP</italic>. Although <italic>fzp</italic> rice lines, which are devoid of FZP activity, develop more secondary and high-order panicle branches, they produce fewer filled grains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Recent studies have indicated that <italic>FZP</italic>-overexpressing plants accelerate the transition between spikelet and floral meristem, which results in a short panicle with fewer branches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These results support a negative regulatory role for <italic>FZP</italic> in panicle branching. Sequence comparison suggests that the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>FZP</italic> may contribute to the reduced <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> expression level observed in this study, although the exact molecular mechanism for this is unclear. Previous studies have indicated that post-transcriptional control, including mRNA stability and translation, plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. The length of the 3&#x02032; UTR is sensed in the process of mRNA quality control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this study, the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> was found to be longer than that of <italic>FZP</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Therefore, the long 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> may be responsible for the low <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> expression levels that result in an increased number of SBs. Furthermore, rice <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> cultivars were observed to have more SBs than the <italic>FZP</italic> cultivars on the upper PBs of the panicle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e,f</xref>), suggesting that rice <italic>qSrn7</italic>/<italic>FZP</italic> cultivars may benefit rice breeding projects aimed at improving grain yield.</p><p id="Par17">Panicle architecture is an important target for rice crop improvement, and genes associated with panicle architecture, such as <italic>DEP1</italic>, <italic>GN1</italic>, and <italic>WFP</italic>, have already proven to be useful in rice breeding programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, little is known about how these genes affect panicle branching pattern. Matsuba<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> reported that the panicle structure of rice cultivars should be classified into five panicle branching patterns based on the differential ability of SBs to form on each PB during developmental process. The panicles of a number of high-yield rice cultivars were classified into five panicle branching patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the panicles of individual high-yield rice cultivars possess different panicle branching patterns, which suggests that various desirable panicle branching phenotypes may be combined in future breeding strategies to develop varieties with panicles that produce even more grain. In this study, we demonstrated that a QTL designated as <italic>qSrn7</italic> effectively increases SB number, but does not influence PB number. The generated KKSLs carrying <italic>qSrn7</italic> displayed a gradual increase in SB number in the upper regions of the panicle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) through enhanced branching of the lateral meristem (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), which increased grain yield. These results show that <italic>qSrn7/FZP</italic> affects higher order branching, and suggests that combining <italic>qSrn7/FZP</italic> with other genes affecting panicle structure would be a beneficial strategy in projects aimed at developing novel high-yield rice varieties. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the combination of QTL analysis using natural variation and the detailed analysis of panicle branching pattern is a useful strategy for identifying genes that can further increase crop productivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par18">Experimental plant material was grown in the research field of Togo Field for Science and Education at Nagoya University, Japan.
