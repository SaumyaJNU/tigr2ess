However, the quality as well as production of maize always encounter several serious threats in the form of viral diseases, such as maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. MRDD, a widespread and destructive disease with dwarfing symptoms, is mainly caused by the infections of <italic>rice black streaked dwarf virus</italic> (RBSDV) in China, <italic>maize rough dwarf virus</italic> (MRDV) in Europe, and <italic>Mal de Rio Cuarto virus</italic> in South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RBSDV, with similar genome structures to MRDV, is a member of the genus <italic>Fijivirus</italic> and the family Reoviridae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The spread of RBSDV among graminaceous hosts, such as rice, maize, wheat and barley, is dependent on brown planthoppers in a persistent and propagative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">RBSDV contains 10 genomic double-stranded RNA segments, named from S1 to S10, encoding at least 13 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In rice and maize, the pathogenic pathways have been partially elucidated. For example, the N-terminal part of the P5&#x02013;2 protein is required for binding to chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another protein of RBSDV, P7&#x02013;2, functions as a key subunit of Skp1/Cul1/F-box complex ubiquitin ligase by interacting with SKP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In rice and maize, the P7&#x02013;2 protein is also involved in gibberellin pathway by interacting with GID2 during the RBSDV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. P9&#x02013;1 of RSBSDV is an alpha-helical protein that plays important roles in the early phase of virus life cycle by forming intracellular viroplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Some studies have reported a series of proteins, genes, and small RNAs that are responsive to the RBSDV infection under various natural conditions. Gene expression profile analyses showed that 4099 genes, including a number of stress response- and development-related genes were altered significantly by the RBSDV infection in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Expression of several calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) genes significantly changed under RBSDV infection, suggesting a role of CAMTA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in maize susceptibility to virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The involvement of transcription factors under the RBSDV infection has also been revealed. In rice, 75 members of the NAC family were differentially accumulated during the infections of RBSDV and other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Dual transcriptome analysis revealed a total of 28 differential expressed genes (DEGs) and 1085 DEGs at 1.5&#x000a0;day and 3&#x000a0;day post-artificial inoculation with RBSDV, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Transcriptional changes of a susceptible rice cultivar in the responses to RBSDV have also been analyzed at two time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Identification of DAPs using mass spectrometry (MS)-based peptide mass fingerprinting and tandem MS/MS-based peptide sequencing is a popular technique for protein quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although several proteome-based works in maize have been conducted, very few proteomic datasets on the response to RBSDV infection have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In rice, cross-talk between the responses to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and to RBSDV infection suggested pivotal roles of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the responses to RBSDV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recently, a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis showed that chitosan oligosaccharide enhanced the resistance of rice to RBSDV infection by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To investigate the responses of maize seedlings to RBSDV infection at the proteome level, comparative proteomic analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material and RBSDV inoculation</title><p id="Par24">Maize, <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. inbred line B73, seeds were surface washed, soaked in clean H<sub>2</sub>O for 2&#x000a0;h, and then germinated in an incubator at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C overnight.

The planthoppers were transferred to new wheat seedlings for an incubation period of 25 d in a greenhouse. Then, about 10 viruliferous adult planthoppers for each seedling were put on maize seedlings for a 6-day inoculation access period. A separated group of seedlings inoculated with health planthoppers was prepared to be used as a control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Calculation of RBSDV copy number</title><p id="Par27">Total RNAs were isolated from maize seedlings using a RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to its protocol.
