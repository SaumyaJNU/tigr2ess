There is very little known about exactly what the ecological cue is that induces the appropriate insect phenotype in wing polyphenic insects. Our study reveals that glucose concentration of the host plant and insect density directly influence the development of brown planthoppers into either the long-winged migratory morph or the short-winged reproductive morph. This study is a step in linking host quality signals and other factors such as density to the induction of adaptive phenotypes in insects.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Food quality is a critical environmental condition that impacts an animal&#x02019;s growth and development. Many insects facing this challenge have evolved a phenotypically plastic, adaptive response. For example, many species of insect exhibit facultative wing growth, which reflects a physiological and evolutionary trade-off between dispersal and reproduction, triggered by environmental conditions. What the environmental cues are and how they are transduced to produce these alternative forms, and their associated ecological shift from dispersal to reproduction, remains an important unsolved problem in evolutionary ecology. In this study, we investigated the role that host quality has on the induction of wing development in a wing polyphenic insect exhibiting strong tradeoffs in investment between dispersal and reproduction, the brown planthopper, a serious rice pest in Asia. As rice plants grow, the short-winged brown planthopper dominates the population, but a shift occurs as the plants mature and senesce in the field such that long-winged brown planthoppers emerge and migrate. It remains unknown how changes in the rice plant induce development of the long-winged morph, despite recent discoveries on the role of the insulin and JNK signaling pathways in wing development. We found that by mimicking the glucose concentration of senescing rice plants, we significantly increased the proportion of long-winged female planthoppers. The effects of glucose on wing morph are additive with previously described effects of density. Our results show that host quality both directly regulates phenotypic plasticity and interacts with other factors such as density to produce the appropriate phenotype for specific environmental conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>host quality</kwd><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>brown planthopper</kwd><kwd>wing dimorphism</kwd><kwd>insulin signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">31672023</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Xinda Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">31471771</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Xinda Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">31741107</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Xinda Lin</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">USDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100005825</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">1001738</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Laura Corley Lavine</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5">National Science Foundation (NSF)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">IOS-0919730</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Laura Corley Lavine</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">An organism must be able to rapidly respond to changing environmental conditions or otherwise face significant consequences in survival, reproduction, and fitness (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Polyphenism, the developmental capacity to couple coordinated expression of alternative suites of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits with circumstance, is an effective solution to this problem, as it permits an organism to facultatively invest in the production of costly traits only when conditions are appropriate. This rapid response to condition is commonly seen in insects such as aphids and crickets, which face a pronounced allocation tradeoff between flight and reproduction (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). During development, these insects either develop into fully winged forms capable of flight or flightless forms that instead allocate resources to reproduction (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although it has long been evident that wing polyphenic insects couple wing growth with exposure to specific environmental cues, such as increased crowding and/or changing nutrition, the environmental cues that trigger the physiological and genetic mechanisms responsible for alternate patterns of wing growth are less well understood.</p><p>Several ecological factors are known to be key inducers of phenotypic plasticity in insects. A critical factor is variation in host quality, which is a well-known cue for insect phenotypic plasticity in growth and form (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The wing polyphenic brown planthopper is a unique system in which to study phenotypic plasticity because of the simple dynamics of the host plant (rice) with the insect. During the early development and growth of the rice plant, host quality is high. Populations of brown planthopper sampled at this time exhibit a high ratio of short-wing to long-wing morphs (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The short-winged morph is considered to be the reproductive form of the brown planthopper (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, as the rice plant begins to mature, the soluble sugar content increases to its highest level and the plant begins to senesce (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This very large increase in glucose has been observed to coincide with an increase in the ratio of the long-winged to short-winged brown planthoppers in field populations (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In the field, ratios of long-winged to short-winged brown planthoppers are highest when the rice plant is senescing or near harvest (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Dispersal is dependent on the long-winged morph (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Migration allows brown planthoppers to escape unfavorable conditions and colonize new areas (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Physiological status and growth stage of the rice plant, temperature, nymph density, and hormones regulating metamorphosis have all been reported to affect the wing morph ratio (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Recent research has revealed the role of several signal transduction pathways in mediating wing dimorphism in the brown planthopper, i.e., the involvement of the insulin signaling and JNK signaling pathways (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), as well as an unidentified pathway induced by wounding that operates, like insulin signaling, through its effect on the transcription factor FOXO (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, it has not been shown precisely how, or even if, ecological factors such host quality and density activate pathways such as insulin signaling or JNK in determining wing morph.</p><p>Although the correlation between the growth stage of rice plants and the wing morph ratio of brown planthoppers has been described (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), the mechanism linking the two remains unknown. Glucose acts as a key signal transduction molecule in the regulatory pathways of plants, allowing rapid adaptation to environmental stress and mediating growth and development (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Glucose is also a molecule critical for animal development, where insulin signaling modulates glucose concentration for cell proliferation, growth, and development. Taken together, these data suggest that glucose concentration in rice plants has a role in regulating wing polyphenism in brown planthoppers.</p><p>Here, we tested the effects of host quality on wing polyphenism by artificially altering glucose concentration in rice seedlings, in conjunction with differing densities of brown planthoppers. We further examined interactions between glucose levels and density on wing morph ratio by altering these variables in conjunction with RNAi-mediated knockdown of insulin signaling genes. We found that higher glucose concentration in rice plants resulted in an increase in the proportion of long-winged female (LWF) brown planthoppers. In addition, the effects of glucose concentration on wing morph were found to be additive with density, indicating host quality both directly regulates phenotypic plasticity and interacts with other factors such as density to produce the appropriate phenotype for specific environmental conditions.</p><sec id="s1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2"><title>Rice Plant Glucose Levels Increase with Plant Growth and Development.</title><p>An important consideration in our artificial elevation of plant glucose concentration is how these levels may correspond to changes in glucose concentration in naturally senescing rice plants. Glucose concentrations in rice plants increase as the plants age and senesce. To compare our manipulated seedlings with naturally occurring changes in rice glucose concentration, we measured glucose concentration during rice plant development in greenhouse and field experiments. We collected rice plants at the seedling, tillering, heading, flowering, grain-filling, and mature stage. The stems were collected, and glucose concentrations were measured. The results showed that, as previously reported (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the glucose concentration of rice plants increased from the seedling stage through the grain-filling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) and decreased at the mature stage as the plant died. The glucose concentrations in field-collected plants were similar to those from the greenhouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), except at the seedling stage, where the glucose concentration was higher in the field than in the greenhouse plants. Also, we were unable to measure some of the later stages in the field. What is important for our study, however, is that the differences in glucose concentration in early versus late season plants are much greater than what was produced by manipulating rice seedlings in the laboratory. Thus, the effect of the increasing glucose concentrations over time in the field could be predicted to have a much greater effect on wing morph, resulting in the near total shift to the long-winged form typically observed in the field.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Variation in glucose levels in rice stalks sampled from the greenhouse and field.

We cultured rice seedlings in culture medium supplemented with 1% glucose for 12, 24, and 48 h and compared them to seedlings grown in media without added glucose. We then measured the concentration of glucose in the rice plants at specified time points.

We fed fourth instar nymphs, which is the critical period for morph determination (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), with rice seedlings cultured in either 1% glucose-supplemented or nonsupplemented control media for 48 h and compared the wing morph ratios. Because of the effect of density on determining wing morph in brown planthoppers (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we also varied the number of nymphs placed in each tube containing a rice seedling, adding 1, 5, 10, or 20 nymphs per tube. Increased density and increased sugar concentration had significant effects on wing morph ratio, but interestingly this was true for female planthoppers only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). When planthoppers developed in numbers higher than one per tube (i.e., 5, 10, or 20), there was a significant increase in the number of LWFs relative to short-winged females (SWF). This was true whether the plants were glucose supplemented and agrees with previous reports of increased density favoring development into long-winged adults (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Likewise, an effect on wing morph due to feeding on glucose-supplemented plants was apparent mainly in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). There was a higher proportion of LWF in supplemented versus nonsupplemented plants for all planthopper densities (although the effect was not statistically significant for the 5 per tube density). However, the effects of density and glucose on males was different&#x02014;there was a significant increase in the long-winged morph only at the highest density, and only in nymphs fed on glucose-supplemented plants. For the males, the only density that differed between glucose-supplemented and controls was 10 leafhoppers per tube&#x02014;and this differed in the opposite direction as with females, with significantly fewer LWM in the glucose-supplemented group. The results showed that increased density and feeding on plants with higher glucose concentrations significantly increased the proportion of females developing into the long-winged morph but had only minimal effects on males.</p><fig id="fig03" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Glucose supplementation increased the ratio of female long-winged brown planthoppers either indirectly through the rice plant or by direct injection into the insect and was dependent on density.

Nymphal glucose levels thus also seem to be critical signals in wing morph determination.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Increased Concentrations of Dietary Glucose Result in Increased Transcription of the Insulin Receptors <italic>NlInR1</italic> and <italic>NlInR2</italic>.</title><p>We also measured transcript expression in the insulin receptors <italic>NlInR1</italic> and <italic>NlInR2</italic> after glucose supplementation at increasing concentrations to rice seedlings.

We tested whether increased glucose content changed the wing morph ratio when simultaneously down-regulating either of the two insulin receptors by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Down-regulation of all of the genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1721473115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>). Down-regulation of <italic>InR1</italic> led to a significant increase in the proportion of short-winged adults as expected, but this effect was dependent on density (two-way ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, df = 3). Specifically, injection of <italic>InR1</italic> double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) significantly increased the short-winged morph ratio, to 100%, at densities of 5 and 10 planthoppers per tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) relative to <italic>GFP</italic> controls for both males and females (this was true for males at a density of one also, but the female nymphs reared at a density of one were already all short-winged).

At densities of 20 per tube, there was no significant difference in ratios of short:long-winged morphs between <italic>InR1</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> treatments, indicating that some density- dependent effects on wing polyphenism may operate independently of the insulin signaling pathway. At present, we hypothesize that density effects are transduced by a pathway other than insulin signaling, and that effects on wing morph are a result of the interplay of potentially conflicting signals from both the insulin and density signaling pathways (i.e., dietary glucose concentration vs. level of crowding).</p><fig id="fig04" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of RNAi-mediated knockdowns of <italic>NlInR1</italic>, <italic>NlInR2</italic>, and <italic>NlFOXO</italic>, glucose supplementation, and density on wing morph ratio. &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; indicates addition of a 1% glucose supplement to the rice seedling culture medium. &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; indicates no glucose was added. 1, 5, 10, and 20 indicate the number of brown planthoppers per tube (density).

When brown planthoppers feed on glucose-supplemented rice seedlings, this results in increased long-winged morphs. When <italic>InR1</italic> is decreased by RNAi, brown planthoppers have an increase in short-winged morphs. The combined experiment of feeding brown planthoppers on glucose-supplemented seedlings inhibited the effect of <italic>InR1</italic> knockdown and resulted in no differences in wing morph ratios between knockdowns and controls across all densities. This was true not only for females, but also for males. And at high densities (20 per tube), which were not affected by <italic>InR1</italic> knockdown in control plants, there was actually a significant increase in the proportion of long-winged adults compared with <italic>GFP</italic> controls on glucose-supplemented seedlings.</p><p>Unlike with <italic>InR1</italic>, density and plant glucose level had little effect on wing morph ratio after <italic>InR2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), knockdown of <italic>InR2</italic> caused a shift to long-winged morphs regardless of density, sex, or plant glucose level. In fact, <italic>InR2</italic> knockdown resulted in 100% long-winged adults, except at a density of one planthopper per tube on nonglucose-supplemented plants, although there was still a significant reduction in the proportion of short-winged adults in this treatment as well. Since increasing both density and glucose content, and knocking down <italic>InR2</italic>, all tend to increase the proportion of long-winged adults, this result was not unexpected.</p><p>It has previously been demonstrated that the effects of <italic>InR1</italic> and <italic>InR2</italic> on brown planthopper wing morph are due to negative regulation by the insulin-signaling cascade of the FOXO transcription factor (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Knockdowns of <italic>FOXO</italic> resulted in a strong shift to the long-winged morph, and this effect was dominant over knockdowns of all insulin signaling pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>). We found that knockdown of <italic>FOXO</italic> through RNAi resulted in 100% long-winged adults, regardless of density, sex, or plant glucose level. As with <italic>InR2</italic>, <italic>FOXO</italic> knockdowns strongly favor development of long-winged morphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>). Increases in density and host glucose content would both tend to shift development to the long-winged morph, and since <italic>FOXO</italic> and <italic>InR2</italic> knockdown almost completely favor development of the long-winged morph, we did not expect to see interactions between these treatments. However, the effects of RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>InR1</italic> were impacted by variations in density and seedling glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>In lower-glucose seedlings, <italic>InR1</italic> knockdown did result in an increased proportion of short-winged individuals at the lower densities, but not at the highest densities. And when nymphs were fed on the glucose-supplemented plants, there was no effect of knockdown of <italic>InR1</italic> (except at the highest density where nymphs were actually more likely to develop into long-winged morphs than <italic>GFP</italic> controls on high glucose plants). The fact that high densities seem to cause effects on wing morph independent of InR1 does not seem especially surprising. We had no a priori reason to suppose that whatever mechanism senses density in planthoppers, they operate wholly or even in part through the insulin signaling pathway. Other signaling pathways (e.g., JNK; ref. <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) may be better candidates as mechanistic determinants of wing polyphenism initiated through changes in density. However, the lack of effect of <italic>InR1</italic> knockdown on wing morph when planthoppers were fed on higher-glucose seedlings was more surprising. There is some possibility that this could reflect a pathway other than the insulin signaling pathway, or at least a receptor other than InR1, mediating the response to higher concentrations of glucose in host plants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s8"><title>Conclusion</title><p content-type="flushleft">Our study is a step toward understanding the role that nutritional variation has in inducing condition-dependent, adaptive phenotypes. We have shown that the developmental response to both higher and lower glucose concentrations is most likely mediated through the insulin signaling pathway based on evidence to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). It is important to note that interpretations of RNAi-induced phenotypes are complicated by the fact that RNAi represents a knockdown, and not knockout, of a particular gene product. Thus, there is some level of continued protein expression, and perhaps residual protein present, in dsRNA-treated study organisms. It is also important to consider our results in light of the possibility that higher plant glucose concentrations surpassed a threshold that allowed the limited quantities of InR1 in <italic>InR1</italic> knockdown individuals to activate the insulin signaling cascade, allowing enough repression of FOXO that development of some long-winged adults could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Again, this is speculative at this point; however, we hypothesize that the insulin signaling pathway responds to increasing levels of glucose in a threshold-dependent manner under normal conditions, so that as glucose concentrations rise, circulating insulin-like peptides levels rise as well, more InR1 receptors are activated, and eventually FOXO suppression becomes great enough that development is switched to the long-winged morph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). Threshold-dependent responses could also account for the differential responsiveness of male and female brown planthoppers to inducers of long-wing morph development.</p><fig id="fig05" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Proposed model of the interaction between plant glucose concentration and wing polyphenism. High glucose concentrations in the phloem of rice plants result in release of higher amounts of insulin in the brown planthopper. Above a certain insulin threshold, activation of the insulin pathway is sufficient to repress the FOXO transcription factor and switch development to the long-wing, migratory morph. Lower plant glucose concentrations result in a subthreshold release of insulin, and FOXO is active, resulting in development of the short-winged, reproductive morph. Question marks indicate that ovary development was not investigated in this study and more work remains to be done to investigate the impact of the early glucose cue on lifetime fecundity in the brown planthopper.</p></caption><graphic id="gra5" xlink:href="pnas.1721473115fig05"/></fig><p>In conclusion, this basic research into the physiological interaction between host plant and insect suggests that any variations in glucose concentrations in rice plants through selective breeding could alter brown planthopper wing-morph ratio in the field, with potential for insect pest management. More research remains to be done to fully explore the nutritional landscape that brown planthoppers face that lead to these adaptive phenotypes. The experimental results presented here provide a solid framework to further investigate how environmental signals are sensed and transduced into adaptive phenotypes. In addition, these results provide a starting point to investigate potential mechanistic linkages in the evolutionary tradeoff between dispersal and reproduction in wing polyphenic insects. At present, we know nothing of the mechanism(s) that account for reductions or delays in reproductive ability in the winged planthopper morph. Our results provide a strong framework to determine if similar signals and transduction pathways operate on the developing ovaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>Insect and Rice Culture.</title><p>The <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> population was maintained in the X.L. laboratory and came originally from a culture provided by Z.
