Salinity is a major environmental factor that impacts on alfalfa&#x02019;s productivity. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying alfalfa responses to salinity, especially the relative contribution of the two important components of osmotic and ionic stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we constructed the first full-length transcriptome database for alfalfa root tips under continuous NaCl and mannitol treatments for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24&#x02009;h (three biological replicates for each time points, including the control group) via PacBio Iso-Seq. This resulted in the identification of 52,787 full-length transcripts, with an average length of 2551&#x02009;bp. Global transcriptional changes in the same 33 stressed samples were then analyzed via BGISEQ-500 RNA-Seq. Totals of 8861 NaCl-regulated and 8016 mannitol-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Metabolic analyses revealed that these DEGs overlapped or diverged in the cascades of molecular networks involved in signal perception, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and antioxidative defense. Notably, several well characterized signalling pathways, such as CDPK, MAPK, CIPK, and PYL-PP2C-SnRK2, were shown to be involved in osmotic stress, while the SOS core pathway was activated by ionic stress. Moreover, the physiological shifts of catalase and peroxidase activity, glutathione and proline content were in accordance with dynamic transcript profiles of the relevant genes, indicating that antioxidative defense system plays critical roles in response to salinity stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Overall, our study provides evidence that the response to salinity stress in alfalfa includes both osmotic and ionic components.

In general, salinity interferes with plant growth because it imposes two main stresses on plants: hyperosmotic pressure, resulting from the low water availability, and ion toxicity (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>), arising from solute imbalances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For plants to survive under this stress condition, they will employ intricate defense mechanisms through a series of drastic physiological and biochemical changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These modifications include maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane, regulating water balance, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and accumulating compatible solutes, as well as reinstating cellular ionic equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which are all dedicated to reducing the osmotic or ionic damage caused by salinity.</p><p id="Par51">The physiological responses of plants acclimating to unfavourable environments are all initiated upon the activation of cascades of molecular networks within the signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the signalling pathways, high salinity level often triggers an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, and ABA, which are critical signal transduction components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, and ABA signalling cascades further alter plant transcriptomes by regulating downstream transcription factors (TFs), such as AP2-EREBPs, MYBs, and bHLHs. Thereafter, these TFs can cause changes in the expression of various osmotic stress-responsive genes, such as <italic>P5CSs</italic> and <italic>COR15As</italic>, and ionic stress-responsive genes, such as <italic>NHXs</italic> and <italic>HKTs</italic>, which ultimately contribute to plant salinity tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recently, several well characterized signalling pathways of plants responding to salinity stress have been revealed, such as the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) pathway, which plays a critical role in osmotic stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway, which is activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes from the cytoplasm and overcomes ionic damage by maintaining cellular ion homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and the calcineurin B-like proteins&#x02013;CBL-interacting protein kinases (CBL-CIPK) module, which is essential to combating both osmotic and ionic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the progress that has been made in detailing these processes, the underlying mechanisms of plants&#x02019; response to salinity need further exploration, especially in non-model plants.</p><p id="Par52">Alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L.), is the most widely cultivated perennial forage legume, and more than 40 million hectares are planted worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This species is referred to as the &#x0201c;queen of forages&#x0201d; and is used as hay, silage, and pasture for ruminants and dairy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, alfalfa possesses considerable potential as a biofuel feedstock for ethanol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In China, alfalfa plantation areas are mainly distributed in the northern, northwestern, and northeastern regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, soil salinization is dramatically increasing in those areas, which dramatically limits the productivity and persistence of alfalfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to perform studies on the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to salinity stress in alfalfa.</p><p id="Par53">Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the stress-associated genes encoding the compatible solute <italic>AgcodA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], ion transporter <italic>SeNHX1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], protein kinase <italic>AtNDPK2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], or TFs <italic>GmDREB1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and <italic>GsWRKY20</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] results in enhanced tolerance to salinity stress in alfalfa. Given the relatively low-throughput characteristics of genetic-based approaches, large-scale potential genes involved in alfalfa responses to adverse salinity stimuli have been studied via next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Postnikova et al. (2013) performed the transcriptional profiling of alfalfa whole roots under NaCl stress for 7&#x000a0;days in two distinct salinity-tolerant germplasms; their results showed that salinity-responsive genes are mainly involved in stabilization of the plasma membrane and several salinity-responsive TF families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Lei et al. (2018) comparatively analyzed the leaf transcriptomes under NaCl stress for 7&#x000a0;days between two different salinity-tolerant alfalfa cultivars, which revealed that plant hormone interactions is a vital regulator in alfalfa to maintain specific physiological status for adaptation to salinity stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, a de novo transcriptional analysis of whole alfalfa seedlings treated with saline&#x02013;alkaline solutions for 0, 1, and 7&#x000a0;days indicated that antioxidant capacity was one of the central mechanisms underlying alfalfa&#x02019;s saline&#x02013;alkaline stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, these studies mainly focused on genotype-specific salinity tolerance mechanisms or more complex saline&#x02013;alkaline tolerance mechanisms, systematic consensus on the comparative damage caused by osmotic versus ionic stresses when alfalfa is subjected to salinity is still lacking. And also, even with these transcriptional-based NGS methods, the disadvantage was clear, such as the short lengths of sequencing reads, which greatly hinders its ability to estimate transcript abundance at genome-wide scale.</p><p id="Par54">Luckily, the PacBio RSII third-generation sequencing technology can overcome these limitations. Compared with traditional NGS technologies, this technology accomplishes single molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) with long read lengths, uniform coverage, and high accuracy, which renders PacBio RSII very effective at capturing the full catalogue of transcripts and constructs of a comprehensive transcriptome for species without genome sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, RNA-Seq based on the BGISEQ-500 platform has been applied to gene expression comparisons of different species, developmental stages, and stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Currently, to our knowledge, genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of the salinity-responsive genes has not been reported in alfalfa root tips, where is the primary site for the perception of hyperosmotic pressure and ion toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, for the first time, we applied the Iso-Seq protocol to generate a full-length reference transcriptome for alfalfa root tips during continuous NaCl (an iso-osmotic stressor) and mannitol (a non-ionic osmotic stressor) treatments and then performed a gene expression comparison for the same stressed samples at the transcriptional scale using BGISEQ-500 RNA-Seq. Moreover, the physiological effects of NaCl and mannitol treatments on ROS accumulation and cell damage, as well as underlying antioxidant and osmoprotectant responses, were determined. The results of this study will help us to understand the contribution of the two osmotic and ionic components towards salinity tolerance in alfalfa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physiology assay</title><p id="Par55">Since high concentrations of NaCl and mannitol cause severe inhibition of growth, moderate concentrations, namely 250&#x02009;mM NaCl and 400&#x02009;mM mannitol, were used for physiological and transcriptome analyses (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par56">When alfalfa seedlings were cultivated under abiotic stress, severe symptoms of injury appeared.

The transcript abundances for the 4 <italic>PYLs</italic> were all inhibited during the 24-h NaCl or mannitol treatment, whereas the remaining genes, including 9 <italic>PP2Cs</italic> and 3 <italic>SnRK2s</italic> were uniformly upregulated after treatment with NaCl or mannitol for 24&#x02009;h (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5b). These results are in agreement with what is known of the ABA regulation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], indicating that osmotic stress can activate the ABA signalling pathway and that it affected the PYLs, PP2Cs, and SnRK2s.</p><p id="Par78">TFs, which are crucial components in osmotic stress-mediated signalling pathways, are generally phosphorylated by protein kinases and directly control the expression of specific sets of downstream stress-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Within the alfalfa transcriptome, at least 188 TFs in 32 TF families, such as the <italic>GRAS</italic>, <italic>MYB</italic>, <italic>AP2-EREBP</italic>, <italic>NAC</italic>, <italic>WRKY</italic>, and <italic>bHLH</italic> families, were identified as being DEGs under the two stresses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S4). These results are consistent with a previous report on alfalfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; however, the number of TFs is higher than that previously reported (102 TFs), which may be because a more comprehensive time-course coverage for stress (from 1 to 24&#x02009;h) was used in our study. The GRAS TF family has been implicated in various biological processes, such as root and meristem development, light signalling, and biotic stress and abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In this study, the largest class of TFs induced by NaCl (28) and mannitol (26) stress was the <italic>GRAS</italic> family. Of these <italic>GRAS</italic> family members, a total of 20 were common to both stresses, and the diverse expression of these DEGs suggested that alfalfa may reduce osmotic damage by regulating root and meristem development (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5c). The MYB family is another group of TFs that are involved in plants&#x02019; response to environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Genetic analysis showed that an overexpression of <italic>OsMYB2</italic> in rice not only resulted in an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype but also improved the salinity, cold, and dehydration tolerance of the transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In this transcriptome analysis, a total of 21 and 15 <italic>MYBs</italic> were identified for NaCl and mannitol, respectively.

Moreover, TFs such as AP2-EREBPs, NACs, WRKYs, and bHLHs are believed to participate in the abiotic stress responses and tolerances in many plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These TFs showed both inducible and suppressed expression patterns after NaCl and mannitol stress (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5c), suggesting that sophisticated transcriptional regulation could participate in the adaptation of alfalfa to adverse environments.</p><p id="Par79">Under osmotic stress, ROS as toxic products, which result in oxidative damage and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Plants sense the increased production of ROS using redox-sensitive TFs and other molecular sensors and activate different ROS defense/metabolic pathways for ROS scavenging, among which the antioxidant defense system prevails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our physiological work showed that both NaCl and mannitol stresses resulted in marked oxidative damage in alfalfa, meaning that the chlorophyll content decreased markedly, ion leakage and lipid peroxidation were significantly aggravated, and ROS levels accumulated markedly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To alleviate oxidative damage, alfalfa significantly activated the antioxidant defence system using ROS detoxification of antioxidants (POD, CAT, and GSH) and osmotic adjustment substance (PRO) to maintain cellular ROS (mainly including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) at relatively low levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Consistently, our transcriptome analysis also revealed that the antioxidant defense system was activated at the molecular level by NaCl and mannitol stress.

Ionic stress (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>) triggers an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and thereafter, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins further activate downstream signalling pathways. CBL-CIPKs signalling modules are one of central calcium signalling mechanisms which regulate plant responding to salinity stress, as well as drought, heat, cold, and low nutrient availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">The SOS pathway is an example of a CBL-CIPK signalling pathway, was first established in plants, and is specific for salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In this pathway, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor CBL4/SOS3 activates the serine/threonine protein kinase CIPK24/SOS2, which positively regulates the plasma membrane-localized Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SOS1, which is also defined as NHX7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Genetic evidence indicates that mutations in SOS1, SOS2, or SOS3 all reduce the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity, and a constitutively active SOS2 enhances Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity in a SOS1-dependent and SOS3-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

Both types of exchangers are required for the intracellular and intercellular ion balance mechanism. In the present NaCl-related transcriptome analysis, the GO categories &#x0201c;iron ion transport&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;ion homeostasis&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;antiporter activity&#x0201d; were significantly enriched after NaCl stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b, f, g), and totals of 4, 1, 11, and 1 DEGs that showed similarity to <italic>NHXs</italic>, <italic>SOS1s</italic>, <italic>SOS2s</italic>, and <italic>SOS3s</italic>, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a; Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S8). The up-regulation of nearly all of these four types of DEGs suggested both the intracellular and intercellular Na<sup>+</sup> detoxification mechanism were activated in alfalfa roots. However, a previous study of salinity-treated alfalfa leaf transcriptome reported that some vacuolar membrane NHXs, rather than plasma membrane SOS1, were induced to very high levels in response to salinity stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], indicating alfalfa mainly compartmentalize excessive cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> into vacuoles via the corresponding vacuolar NHXs in leaves.

Next, a total of 8861 NaCl-regulated and 8016 mannitol-regulated DEGs were identified and analyzed for their potential role in the response to abiotic stress using clustering, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. These DEGs overlapped or diverged in the cascades of molecular networks involved in signal perception, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and antioxidative defense (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).
