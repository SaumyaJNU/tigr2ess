Introduction</title><p>Treatment for bone loss resulting from bone disease or bone defects caused by an accident typically requires a bone transplant [<xref rid="B1-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hydroxyapatite ((Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>; (HA)) is a potassium phosphate-based bioceramic material and is the main bone substitute used for such treatment. Its chemical components are similar to that of human bone or teeth and have excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. As HA exhibits osteoconduction, which promotes osteoblast activities, and osteoinduction, which induces cytodifferentiation, it is widely used as a bone alternative or a composite material in dentistry and orthopedics [<xref rid="B2-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the mechanical properties, such as its strength and fracture toughness, are weak due to the highly brittle nature of ceramic HA. Hence, it cannot be used alone in areas of the body that bear substantial weight. However, ceramic HA can be easily applied by coating it on the surface of metal biomaterials, such as titanium, cobalt-chromium alloys, or stainless steel. In such cases, the outstanding mechanical properties of metal and the excellent biocompatibility of ceramics are provided simultaneously [<xref rid="B4-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To create the mechanical properties in an HA coating layer, many studies have reported adding a different substance as a reinforcing agent to HA, such as partially stabilized zirconia [<xref rid="B6-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], or alumina [<xref rid="B7-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, a considerable amount of reinforcing agent is required to yield the desired mechanical properties, and existing reinforcing agents are either inactive in the body or have lower bioactivity than HA. HA complexes combined with a large volume of reinforcing agents exhibit reduced coherence with bone tissue compared to HA alone. Therefore, new research should focus on improving the mechanical properties of HA complexes by adding a reinforcing agent with the same bioactivity, or by adding the smallest possible volume of reinforcing agents without drastically decreasing the bioactivity of HA.</p><p>Meanwhile, after researchers reported that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit bioactive properties, the application of CNTs increased in the biomedical field [<xref rid="B8-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CNTs were first discovered by lijima in 1991 [<xref rid="B10-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and have since been studied for various uses, including displays, fuel cells, and medical applications, due to their outstanding thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties resulting from their unique molecular structure [<xref rid="B11-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A CNT has the shape of a graphite sheet rolled into a cylinder and may exhibit a variety of structures, including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), and rope nanotubes. Furthermore, CNTs also have a large aspect ratio. CNTs are reported to have a high elastic modulus of 1 TPa or more, and a high tensile strength up to 30 GPa [<xref rid="B13-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], although this differs depending on the synthesis method. These excellent mechanical properties have led to many studies on the use of CNTs as a reinforcing agent to produce high strength composite materials [<xref rid="B11-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other studies report improved mechanical properties in an HA coating layer by adding CNTs as a reinforcing agent due to the biological characteristics and superior mechanical properties of CNTs [<xref rid="B17-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CNTs are a very interesting material with potential biomedical applications.</p><p>MWCNT-HA composites have been steadily studied to use as biomaterials. MWCNT-HA composites produced by various methods can be used for dental and orthopedic biomaterials since it was identified that they have good biocompatibility through various in vivo and in vitro tests [<xref rid="B19-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Further, the studies for MWCNT-HA coating on the surface of implants were actively conducted to enhance the bioactivity of implants. Various methods, such as electrophoretic deposition [<xref rid="B18-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], plasma spraying [<xref rid="B22-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and sol-gel dip-coating [<xref rid="B23-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have been developed to coat MWCNT-HA on titanium alloys. Among them, the coating produced by sol-gel dip-coating has a higher binding force (44 MPa) than coatings produced by electrophoretic deposition (2.8 MPa) and plasma spraying (29 MPa). In this study, MWCNTs-HA was coated on titanium using sol-gel dip-coating with excellent binding force to improve the bioactivity, and then their surface characteristics and biocompatibility were evaluated.</p><p>Our study used the sol-gel method to produce a MWCNTs-HA nanocomposite with various contents of MWCNTs. The composite was used to coat the surface of pure titanium in order to improve bioactivity. Changes in the surface properties of the coated titanium were examined, and the impact on cell growth from the CNT-HA coated titanium surface was surveyed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-materials-12-00224"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Extensive research is being conducted on ceramic-CNT composites, especially regarding the various effects of CNTs on the mechanical properties of ceramic-CNT composites [<xref rid="B24-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A recent study used HA complexes reinforced with CNTs as materials for bone substitution [<xref rid="B25-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Bone and enamel minerals are related to the formation of HA in the synthesis system of a biomimetic environment. Bone and enamel may share HA with the same mineral composition, but they differ in shape and organic matter [<xref rid="B26-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, HA formation is important from a therapeutic approach for tissue treatment. CNTs have a structure that can replace collagen fibers and play the role of a structural stiffener for use as tissue scaffolding. Moreover, the strong electrical and chemical characteristics of CNTs offer an opportunity to monitor implant interaction with matrix components aside from cells by delivering influences derived from tissues, such as electrical stimuli, growth factors, and dielectric substances that participate in osteoblast growth [<xref rid="B27-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Composites of CNTs and HA can be developed as a coating, nanocomplex, or hybrid powder for potential use in soft tissue reconstruction [<xref rid="B20-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, CNT coatings and complexes have been successfully used as substrates for biomineralization and osteoblast growth, proliferation, and normal function [<xref rid="B17-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>This study used the sol-gel method to produce MWCNTs-HA nanocomposites at various concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 1 wt % MWCNTs), and a pure titanium surface was coated in order to improve bioactivity. The properties of the MWCNTs-HA coated titanium surface and the impact of the MWCNTs-HA coated titanium surface on cell growth were surveyed. To create complexes mixed with CNTs (which has ~10<sup>3</sup> aspect ratio) as stiffeners, it is extremely important to disperse the CNTs as evenly as possible in the complex. To this end, this study generated and used a COOH functional group on the surface of the MWCNTs by treating all MWCNTs with acid. The sol-gel method was used to produce a complex MWCNTs-HA powder. The shape of the MWCNTs-HA was verified using SEM and TEM. The results showed that HA with nanoparticles was attached to the surface of long tube-shaped MWCNTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00224-f001">Figure 1</xref>a&#x02013;d).

P&#x02013;O bonds were found at 567, 604, 1047, and 1089 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from HA, and OH bonds were found at 3419 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref rid="B17-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. No new peaks were found in the MWCNTs-HA, but in the MWCNTs-HA graph, the peaks at 1047 and 1089 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were sharper than in the HA graph. According to Kaya et al., the separated bands at 1047 and 1089 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were advantageous for forming a crystallized apatite structure [<xref rid="B18-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the XRD pattern of the MWCNTs-HA nanocomposite, crystalline HA was discovered at 2&#x003b8; values of 23&#x000b0;, 26&#x000b0;, 32&#x000b0;, and 49&#x000b0; (JCPDS card # 09-0432). However, no MWCNT peaks were found in the XRD. The carbon phase could not be verified because the CNT content was too low and carbon peaks with a 2&#x003b8; = 26&#x000b0; were identical. Moreover, the peak in the graph became sharper as the CNT content increased. In addition, the XRD pattern from the titanium implant surface coated with MWCNTs-HA nanocomposites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00224-f004">Figure 4</xref>) did not show a change in titanium&#x02019;s chemical components with surface treatment, and the HA peak became sharper as more CNTs were added. This implies that there was an increase in the concentration of HA crystals. Due to the negative charge caused by the functional group on the surface of the CNTs, the CNTs were assumed to serve as a favorable location for forming the nucleus of HA [<xref rid="B29-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When the CNT surface was well-fitted with an ionic group, calcium or phosphate ions were induced on the surface, and ions with opposite charge were induced to form the nucleus [<xref rid="B30-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This nucleus generation was accompanied by crystallization and further crystal growth. The chemical functionalization of CNTs permitted increased hydrophilicity and modified many groups on the surface of the reformed tube, thereby providing a site for the generation of countless nuclei [<xref rid="B30-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a result, fine HA crystals can deposit quickly at high density along the tube axis. As such, if the formation of HA on the CNT surface increased, it contributes to bonding with the surrounding bone tissue and new bone formation.</p><p>When the surface of titanium is coated with MWCNTs-HA nanocomposite particles, MWCNTs and HA particles become aggregated on the microstructure of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The particles on the 1 wt % MWCNTs-HA surface were less aggregated than on the 0.5 wt % MWCNTs surface. The 1 wt % MWCNTs-HA surface was more even than the other surfaces. According to previous studies, particles increase in size as the CNT content increases, so long as CNT content was 0.5 wt % or less during formation of HA crystals. However, the particles became smaller once the content exceeded 5 wt % [<xref rid="B31-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This study also found that particles became larger on the 0.5 wt % MWCNTs surface, but become smaller on the 1 wt % MWCNTs surface. The surface became wider as the particles increased in size, thereby providing a better environment for cells to attach.</p><p>The superior properties of CNTs, such as their ultra-high surface area, electrical conductivity, and mechanical strength, make CNTs an attractive nanomaterial for various applications, including in the biomedical field [<xref rid="B32-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An evaluation of the bioactivity and toxicity of composites is necessary for the use of CNTs as a biomaterial. Various research results have found that CNTs present in biocomposites have no harmful effects and improve bioactivity. George et al. [<xref rid="B33-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] studied human epithelial cells and osteoblasts, as well as their reaction with MWCNTs. This study showed that the size and spacing of CNTs are key determinants of a cell&#x02019;s spread and growth. Price et al. [<xref rid="B34-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that the adhesion of osteoblasts accelerated when carbon nanofibers with a diameter of 60 to 200 nm are generated by chemical vapor deposition through bonds with themselves or with polyurethane. This study verified the proliferation of osteoblasts after cultivation on the surface of titanium coated with MWCNTs-HA at various concentrations for 2 and 5 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In all groups, osteoblast proliferation increased as cultivation time increased. After 2 d of cell cultivation, cell proliferation increased as the volume of MWCNTs decreased, but there were no statistically significant differences for the 1 wt % MWCNT group. After 5 d of cell cultivation, there were no statistically significant differences between groups with regards to cell proliferation. This shows that MWCNTs do not impact the proliferation of cells. Moreover, upon observing the shape of the cells on the surface of each surface treated group, the filopodia of cells in the group coated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 wt % MWCNTs-HA were less developed than in the uncoated group. Zanello et al. [<xref rid="B9-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared bone formation and proliferation of cells in functionalized and non-functionalized CNTs. They found that the growth of rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells occurred on the surface of as-prepared SWNTs and neutrally-charged polyethylene glycol-functionalized SWNTs. Furthermore, they also claimed that multi-layered CNTs or MWCNTs can be used to control the shape of the cells and cytodifferentiation.</p><p>Long-term research is required to determine the survival rate of osteoblasts. Osteoblast differentiation markers that appear during osteoblast cultivation occur based on the degree of cell proliferation and differentiation, and bone is formed through three processes that involve a growth phase, substrate maturation period, and calcification. Of all bone markers, ALP is a marker that appears at the beginning of osteoblast differentiation. It peaks during the substrate maturation period and decreases during the calcification stage. ALP present in bone tissue hydrolyzes phosphate esters to control the metabolism of phosphoric acid and maintain phosphoryl metabolites at a certain level. ALP also plays the role of phosphoprotein phosphatase. In the results of this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-00224-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows the ALP activity on the titanium surface coated with MWCNTs-HA after cell cultivation for 7 and 10 d. The results on the 7th and 10th day of cell cultivation show that ALP activity increased as MWCNTs increased when the content of MWCNTs was 0.5% or lower, and ALPT activity decreased when the content of MWCNTs exceeded 0.5%. When CNTs were included, cell differentiation was found to increase. According to previous studies, the surface of CNTs was suitable for apatite mineralization. CNTs accelerate new bone formation and bonding with coated implants [<xref rid="B35-materials-12-00224" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, HA crystals form more easily on the surface of titanium coated with MWCNTs-HA nanocomplex particles as the amount of CNTs increases, and 0.5 wt % MWCNTs-HA particles increase in size. The cell proliferation results and cytodifferentiation of MWCNTs-HA composites showed that cell proliferation was successful regardless of the MWCNT concentration, and cytodifferentiation was highest on the 0.5 wt % MWCNTs-HA surface. MWCNTs-HA composites can be used as a bone substitute.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-materials-12-00224"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, sol-gel processing method was used to produce MWCNTs-HA nanocomposites with different MWCNTs concentration. The nanocomposites were used to coat the surface of titanium such that MWCNTs could be used as bone substitutes. The structural characteristics of a MWCNTs-HA complex powder showed that HA nanoparticles bonded to the surface of the MWCNTs. Crystallization on the MWCNTs-HA nanocomposite showed that crystallization of HA was improved as the concentration of MWCNTs increased.</p><p>The cell test results with different MWCNT concentrations showed that cell proliferation increased regardless of the MWCNT concentration, and the filopodia of cells developed in the specimen that included MWCNTs.
