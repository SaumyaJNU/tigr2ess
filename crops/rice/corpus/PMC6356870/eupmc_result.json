    "Multi walled carbon nanotubes-hydroxyapatite (MWCNTs-HA) with various contents of MWCNTs was synthesized using the sol-gel method. MWCNTs-HA composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). HA particles were generated on the surface of MWCNT. Produced MWCNTs-HA nanocomposites were coated on pure titanium (PT). Characteristic of the titanium coated MWCNTs-HA was evaluated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and XRD. The results show that the titanium surface was covered with MWCNTs-HA nanoparticles and MWCNTs help form the crystalized hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, the MWCNTs-HA coated titanium was investigated for in vitro cellular responses. Cell proliferation and differentiation were improved on the surface of MWCNT-HA coated titanium."
