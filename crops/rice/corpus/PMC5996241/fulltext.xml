Under conditions of Fe deficiency, plants alter several processes to acquire Fe from soil. In this study, we used rice cultivars H 9405 with high Fe accumulation in seeds and Yang 6 with low Fe accumulation in seeds to study their physiological responses to different conditions of Fe availability. In both shoots and roots, the responses of ROS enzymes, leaf and root ultrastructure and photosynthetic system to iron deficiency in Yang 6 were much sensitive than those in H 9405. For the distribution of iron, the iron content was much higher in roots of Yang 6, in contrast to higher shoot content in H 9405. Differential responses were shown with the Fe content in roots and shoots, which were the opposite in the two varieties; thus, we proposed the existence of long-distance signals. Then split root and shoot removal experiments were used to demonstrate that a long-distance signal was involved in the iron-deficient rice plant, and the signal strength was highly correlated with the functional leaves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>)</kwd><kwd>Fe deficiency</kwd><kwd>shoot</kwd><kwd>root</kwd><kwd>response</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004608</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">BK20160716</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron (Fe) is an important mineral nutrient that is vital for a variety of cellular and other physiological functions ranging from metabolism to growth and development, including chlorophyll synthesis, respiration, redox reactions, and electron transfer. Although Fe is one of the most abundant elements in the geosphere, Fe deficiency has become a common problem in plant production worldwide, many plants suffer from Fe deficiency (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 2003</xref>). This deficiency is because most Fe in soil exists as Fe oxides, phosphate, or other insoluble compounds (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Grusak et al., 1999</xref>), limiting the uptake and effectiveness.</p><p>Based on molecular biology studies, plants activate processes that are correlated with Fe absorption, transfer, and utilization in adapting to a low Fe environment. Under iron deficiency, plants adopt two Fe-absorption strategies, reduction (strategy I) and chelation (strategy II). Dicots and non-gramineous monocots use the reduction strategy composed of H<sup>+</sup> release, Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup> reduction and Fe<sup>2+</sup> transport into roots by the Fe-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Colangelo and Guerinot, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dinneny et al., 2008</xref>). Gramineous plants use chelation in which the phytosiderophores (PSs), such as MAs (mugineic acids), are released into the rhizosphere to directly chelate Fe<sup>3+</sup> in rice, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of MAs contain nicotianamine synthase (OsNAS1, OsNAS2); then, the resulting Fe(III)-PS complexes are absorbed by root cells via proteins in the YS family, such as yellow stripe 1 (YS1) in maize (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Curie et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In rice, OsYSL15 is the protein that transports Fe(III)-PS into roots. <italic>OsYSL15</italic> is up regulated under Fe deficiency and is expressed in the root epidermis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Once Fe enters the root, it will be loaded into xylem and phloem to transport in shoot in complex forms. The YELLOW STRIPE 1-like 2 (OsYSL2) transporter is responsible for Fe(II)-NA transport across the plasma membrane and plays a pivotal role in phloem-mediated iron distribution (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Koike et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A signal is likely required to transmit nutrient status from shoots to roots for the absorption of a variety of nutrients (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Forde, 2002</xref>). For iron, indirect evidence indicates the existence of a long-distance signal. <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Vert et al. (2003)</xref> proposed a promotive model and a repressive model concerning the mechanism of the signal of iron uptake in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In the promotive model, a signal generated in leaves is sent to roots and induces the expression of iron uptake genes under the iron-deficient condition; however, the signal is not sent to roots when iron is sufficient. In the repressive model, iron-sufficient shoots constitutively express a signal, which suppresses the root iron uptake response; the signal disappears under the iron-deficient condition.</p><p>Several hormones are involved in the iron-deficient signaling in strategy I plants, such as ethylene, auxin and NO, which increase significantly under iron deficiency (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Romera et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Lucena et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Graziano and Lamattina, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bacaicoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lingam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meiser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Ram&#x000ed;rez et al., 2011</xref>). However, for plants that use strategy II, information on the signaling molecules that respond to iron deficiency is limited (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). In rice, brassinosteroids negatively regulate the iron-related genes under iron deficiency, and jasmonate pathway signaling is activated in the early stage of iron deficiency in rice roots (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found the distribution of iron caused different physiological responses to iron deficiency in different rice genotypes, including those of leaf and root ultrastructure, photosynthesis and ROS system. Furthermore, split root and shoot removal experiments were used to determine whether the regulation of iron-induced gene expression in the roots was promotive or repressive and which part of the shoot generated the signal. The expression of iron regulated marker genes were also investigated. We proposed that long-distance signals were generated in shoots associated with the regulation of iron uptake from roots, and that the signal strength was highly correlated with functional leaves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials</title><p>Two indica rice cultivars H 9405 and Yang 6 were used in this study.

And also the genes expression levels in the split system without Fe showed increase, but not as much as the whole root under Fe deficiency, indicating the communication between the split root.

Leaf excision experiments were carried out to clarify the hypothesis. We established different patterns of the shoot excised experiments: A, all leaves; B, all leaves removed; C, all mature leaves removed, with the fresh leaf intact; D, removed all the leaves besides of the fresh leaf; E, the upper functional leaves removed; F, the oldest leaves removed. Roots were harvested 3, 5, and 7 days after the shoot removal treatments and were used to analyze the expression levels of <italic>OsYSL15, OsNAS1</italic>, and <italic>OsNAS2</italic>. From <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref></bold>, in treatment B with all the leaves excision, the expression levels of the above three marker genes were pretty low in both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient plants, which means the decrease of expressions of iron uptake genes in rice roots might be caused by an absence of long distance signal. In order to elucidate which part of the shoot is involved in the signal generation, we measured the <italic>OsYSL15, OsNAS1</italic>, and <italic>OsNAS2</italic> after the leaves were excised at different positions. The gene expression levels in all patterns under Fe-sufficient conditions were very low. Under Fe-deficient condition, we can see high expression levels in both control plant and the F treatment (only functional leaves left); simultaneously, when all the mature leaves were removed and the fresh leaf remained, the level of expression was pretty low, which indicated that the fresh leaf was not essential in the signal transduction. From treatments E and F, we observed that the effect of functional leaves on the induction of <italic>OsYSL15</italic> expression level was much greater than that of the fresh leaf. Partial removal of the functional leaves weakened the expression level of <italic>OsYSL15</italic>. When all shoot parts were removed, no expression of <italic>OsYSL15</italic> was detected; thus, the shoot part had a relatively quantifiable relationship with the level of induction of <italic>OsYSL15</italic> expression.

However, remobilization-related genes in shoot vasculature were expressed oppositely between the two varieties: in H 9405, the expression of these genes was up regulated, whereas in Yang 6, the expression was reduced. Our results in that earlier study show that the differential expression of root uptake and shoot-remobilization genes in the two cultivars is correlated with the Fe content in roots, shoots, and seeds. In brown rice and polished rice, the iron content in H 9405 is significantly higher than that in Yang 6; particularly in polished rice, the Fe content was approximately 5-fold higher. We also measured the Fe content of different organs in the two genotypes after treatment, and the Fe content in shoots of H 9405 was 1&#x02013;3-fold higher than that in Yang 6, whereas in roots, the content of Fe in Yang 6 was significantly higher than that in H 9405 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Based on those results, we proposed that under iron deficiency, a shoot-borne signal is correlated with the iron distribution, and that the signal has an important role in inducing physiological and morphological alterations.</p><p>Based on the discovery from the rice proteomic study under iron deficiency (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), photosynthetic characteristics, anti-oxidation systems and marker genes correlated with Fe uptake and transport and signal transduction pathway played key roles. In this study, under iron deficiency, the damage to the ultrastructure of shoot and root cells was dramatic in Yang 6, whereas the degree of damage was much less in H 9405. Yang 6 also showed a significant decrease in Pn under iron deficiency, whereas the rate in H 9405 showed no change. Additionally, leaf and root ultrastructure damage under iron deficiency was much greater in Yang 6 than in H 9405. Furthermore, the shoot-to-root ratio increased under iron deficiency (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>), which suggested that the transport of sucrose from shoot to root was damaged because of iron deficiency. More lateral roots emerged to absorb the iron surrounding the rhizosphere. For the iron content in roots, the concentration in Yang 6 was much higher than that in H 9405. Therefore, when the two cultivars simultaneously sense an iron deficiency, the response should be most severe in H 9405 because of the lower iron content in roots. However, the opposite response was observed, which could be explained by a long-distance signal originated in the shoot.</p><p>For the critical enzymes involved in the ROS system, the trends were similar to those of shoot and root ultrastructure. In H 9405, the antioxidative enzymes of the leaf showed no significant changes, whereas in roots, these enzymes were activated. In Yang 6, the detoxification cycle was activated in both shoots and roots. In shoots, the response of ROS enzymes was consistent with the degree of cell ultrastructure damage in the two varieties. In Yang 6, contents of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA increased significantly, but no significant change was observed in H 9405. However, in roots, the contents of both increased under iron deficiency. Additionally, under iron deficiency, the trends of change of SOD and POD activity were similar to that of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We also measured two key enzymes that participate in the re-generation of the ROS system. In Yang 6 leaf, the GR content increased, but in the roots, the content decreased. The content of APX decreased in both leaf and root in Yang 6, which might be because iron is required in the biosynthesis of APX. In H 9405, APX content increased slightly in the root. In an earlier study, under iron deficiency, the rate of iron decrease was less in the roots of H 9405, and because the iron content might be sufficient for biosynthesis, the content of APX increased. The GR is downstream of APX in the ROS cycle and therefore showed a similar trend in the two varieties in this study. The different responses might also be due to the iron distribution in the two varieties. The iron content in the shoot of H 9405 was higher than that in Yang 6, and under iron deficiency, the antioxidative enzyme activities did not change significantly; thus, the increase in activity in Yang 6 might due to the lower iron content in the shoot. Therefore, Yang 6 was much more sensitive than H 9405 to iron deficiency in the shoot. Based on the comparison of the different responses of the two varieties under iron deficiency, we propose a signal originated in the shoot and was transmitted into the root to induce the ROS system, and because the reduced iron content in Yang 6 leaf resulted in a stronger signal, the range of increase in Yang 6 was highly significant. From the ultrastructure data and the ROS enzymes data, we can obvious observed the clues of the existence of the long distance signal involved in the iron deficient rice plants.</p><p>Recent experiments using approaches such as split-root and leaf defoliation clearly show that shoot-borne signals produced in mature leaves or the shoot apex and transmitted in the phloem have important roles in inducing physiological and morphological alterations (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Landsberg, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Enomoto et al., 2007</xref>). Although we propose that shoot-borne signals are involved in an integrative physiological response under Fe deficiency, the nature of signals involved in this whole-plant regulation of iron uptake remain unknown (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Split root and shoot excision experiments were adopted in our study to study the signal originates. We found removal of leaves affected the expression level of the marker gene in roots under iron deficiency in a quantitative relationship between the part removed and the range of induction of the marker gene. In the treatment with all leaves removed, <italic>OsYSL15, OsNAS1, and OsNAS2</italic> were not induced under iron deficiency. In tobacco leaf excision experiments, the root tissue in which the iron uptake genes express doesn&#x02019;t lose bioactivity by leaf removal (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Enomoto et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, a single new fresh leaf did not induce the marker gene under iron deficiency; however, the mature leaves did induce the marker gene, and the signal intensity was in proportion to the amount of mature leaves. All the above data indicate a long-distance signal occurred in iron-deficient rice plants with the signal intensity related to the mature leaves. In a future experiment, we will focus on identification of phloem signals.</p><p>To summarize the above discussion, with less iron in the shoot, Yang 6 might generate a stronger signal in the shoot than that of H 9405; thus, Yang 6 was more sensitive to iron deficiency. A reasonable conclusion is that rice differs in the response to iron deficiency because of the shoot-root iron distribution, and that the physiological alterations are at least partially controlled by the signals generated in the shoots but transmitted to roots via phloem. When rice encounters iron deficiency, the photosynthetic system will be destroyed, the ROS system will be activated, and carbohydrates will be accumulated in the shoot, with impaired phloem export increasing the shoot/root ratio (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>FIGURE 11</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation of changes in signal transduction, photo-oxidative damage and carbohydrate transport in rice under iron deficiency.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-00757-g011"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LC and YD contributed equally to this work.
