    "BACKGROUND:An acute scrotal hematoma, secondary to a spontaneous rupture of a varicocele is still a rare presentation in daily practice. However, multiple case reports have been reported. Sudden increase in abdominal pressure, resulting to an increased venous pressure can lead to a rupture of the varicocele. Literature search shows that due to uncertainty of the diagnosis, explorative surgery is often performed, sometimes resulting in unnecessary orchiectomies. The objective of this study was to determine classical clinical presentation of patients with a spontaneous rupture of a varicocele, determine the diagnostic procedure, and give an insight in the follow-up. CASE PRESENTATION:We present a case of a 24-year old male with acute scrotal swelling after sneezing. Subsequently, we carried out a systematic literature search to identify all eligible studies to determine classic clinical presentation of spontaneous ruptures of a varicocele. CONCLUSION:The literature search shows that clinical presentation of idiopathic spontaneous scrotal hematomas is similar to testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, malignancy, or (incarcerated) inguinal hernia making differential diagnosis difficult. Especially when there has been increased abdominal pressure or strenuous activity preceding the symptoms, and the swelling is left sided, it should be included in the differential diagnosis for patient with acute inguinoscrotal swelling. Colour Doppler-Ultrasonography is recommended to distinguish between other causes of acute scrotum. The hematoma is usual self-limiting, justifying conservative treatment. Early surgical intervention is indicated with signs of ischaemia due to obstruction, infection of the hematoma, or uncertain diagnosis (i.e. malignancy). However, physicians should be cautious with direct exploration, as it led to unnecessary orchiectomy in 25% of patients. The hematoma can increase in size up to 3 months post-event, and it can take up to 15 months to completely resolve."
