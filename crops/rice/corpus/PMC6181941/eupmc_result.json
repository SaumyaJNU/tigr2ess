    "It is urgently to minimize nitrogen (N) loss while simultaneously ensuring high yield for maize in China. A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of root-zone fertilization (RZF) and split-surface broadcasting (SSB) on grain yield, N use efficiency (NUE), and urea-15N fate under different N rates (135, 180 and 225 kg ha-1). Results showed that RZF increased grain yield by 11.5%, and the N derived from fertilizer (Ndff%) by 13.1-19.6%, compared with SSB. The percentage of residual 15N in the 0-80 cm soil was 37.2-47.4% after harvest; most 15N (64.4-67.4%) was retained in the top 20 cm. RZF significantly increased the N apparent recovery efficiency (NARE) and 15N recovery in maize by 14.3-37.8% and 21.9-30.0%, respectively; while decreased N losses by 11.2-24.2%, compared with SSB. The RZF of urea can be considered a slow-release fertilizer, which better matches maize N demand and effectively reduces N losses. Overall, RZF achieved yields as high as the SSB, but with a 20-25% reduction in N application. These results help improve our understanding of N fate in the maize cropping system, and may help guide recommendations for N management in southeastern China."
