This challenge further exacerbates the intensity and frequency of extreme events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The global temperature is predicted to rise 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C by 2100, which may cause the duration and frequency of drought periods to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, drought is an important abiotic stress for plants that constrains plant growth and yield around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unlike animals, plants cannot escape environmental pressures and are constantly exposed to various environments during their life cycles. To survive in these harsh environments, plants develop many resistance mechanisms. For example, the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> responds to abiotic stress by undergoing morphological and physiological characteristic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms that plants use to respond to drought stress.</p><p id="Par15">A considerable portion of the eukaryotic genome can be transcribed into RNAs but will not be translated into proteins. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a set of RNAs that cannot code for proteins. NcRNAs consist of housekeeping, regulatory and functionally unknown ncRNAs. Regulatory ncRNAs are usually grouped into groups, such as miRNAs, small interfering RNAs and lncRNAs, according to their lengths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In general, lncRNAs are longer than 200&#x02009;nt in length and lack region of protein coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. LncRNAs are generally classified into different types based on the relative location between PCgenes and lncRNAs in genome. For example, intronic lncRNAs and long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are transcribed from intron and intergenic regions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, more than 30% of lncRNAs are lincRNAs, though antisense lncRNAs are also abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Transcription analysis indicated that lncRNAs have low transcription level and specific expression patterns in plant tissue. Furthermore, lncRNAs also showed low conservation and be located to subcellular compartments. Compared to PCgenes, lncRNAs were initially considered to be inconsequential transcriptional &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par16">However, increasing studies suggested that lncRNAs involved in multiple biological processes, such as flowering time, root organogenesis, photomorphogenesis and sexual reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, lncRNAs are recognized as playing key regulatory mechanism in plant under abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For example, more than 1000 lncRNAs are regulated by salt stress and 318 lncRNAs respond to cold and/or drought stress in cotton and cassava, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Functional analysis of some lncRNAs has indicated that they can regulate the expression of genes in close proximity (<italic>cis-acting</italic>) or at a distance (<italic>trans-acting</italic>) in the genome via numerous of mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the activation/transportation of accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Compared to studies focused on lncRNAs in mammals, only a few studies have reported the functions of lncRNAs in plants, especially in grass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, <italic>COLDAIR</italic>, an intronic lncRNA, is transcribed from the first intron in <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) and has been identified to be associated with the silencing and epigenetic repression of <italic>FLC</italic> to regulate flowering time in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. <italic>AtIPS1</italic> and <italic>At4</italic> have been identified to act as target mimics of miR399 by binding to and sequestering miRNA399 and reducing the miRNA399-midiated cleavage of <italic>PHO2</italic>, which is important for phosphate uptake in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Because lncRNAs have important functions in plants, several strategies have been employed to detect and discover novel lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Microarrays, tiling arrays and next generation sequencing have been used as high-throughput tools in genome-wide analyses to identify new transcripts. Thousands of lncRNA transcripts have been identified in several plant species. To date, more than 200,000 lncRNAs from 44 plant species have been found in the Green Non-Coding Database (GreeNC Database) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par18"><italic>Cleistogenes songorica</italic> is a C<sub>4</sub> grass in the Poaceae family and an important perennial forage and ecological grass. <italic>C. songorica</italic> can grow in saline, semi-arid and desert areas in Northwest China, such as Inner Mongolia, where the average annual rainfall is 110&#x02009;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To study the drought tolerance mechanism of <italic>C. songorica</italic>, expression sequence tags (ESTs) from two organs were sequenced under drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

These studies have revealed the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and that lncRNA play important roles in many vital biological processes. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of lncRNA regulation will provide a molecular basis for resistance research in plants. However, the genome identification and characterization of known and novel lncRNAs under drought stress in still lacking, especially in <italic>C. songorica</italic>. As a native plant, <italic>C. songorica</italic> has adapted to its harsh environment during its long evolutionary process. We recently completed <italic>C. songorica</italic> whole genome sequencing. MiRNAs have also been discovered in this plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, stand-specific libraries were constructed to distinguish the sense and antisense lncRNAs. Moreover, the abundant clean data generated allowed us to detect low expression level lncRNAs in our research. To provide useful information for predicting putative lncRNA targets, PCgenes were also sequenced and compared in both shoots and roots under control and stress conditions.</p><p id="Par41">In total, 3397 lncRNAs were identified in <italic>C. songorica</italic> in this study. The number of lncRNAs was more than was identified in maize and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which may be due to the strict criteria or species differences. Compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs were shorter and had fewer exons in <italic>C. songorica</italic>. Moreover, <italic>C. songorica</italic> lncRNAs transcription levels were lower than that of mRNAs and lncRNAs were less conserved in different species. These results are consistent with previous results in other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. LncRNAs can modulate alternative splicing by hybridizing with target sense RNAs and blocking the recognition of the spliceosome splice site. Compared with 48.1% lncRNAs splicing in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], 78.5% of <italic>C. songorica</italic> lncRNAs were spliced. Moreover, 412 and 87 lncRNAs were identified and differentially expressed in roots and shoots, respectively. However, the number of DEGs in different organs was roughly the same. This suggested that lncRNAs exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns.</p><p id="Par42">Even though some lncRNAs have verified functions, the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs participate in bioprocesses are still largely unknown. For example, lncRNAs can regulate PCgenes transcription, post-transcription, and at post-translation levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Overall, several lncRNA mechanisms have emerged and have been classified as signalling, decoying, guiding and scaffolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, some lncRNAs have both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-<italic>acting</italic> roles in regulating target genes. Because we had more than 5 samples, both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> targeted genes were identified in this study. In total, 4885 and 722 specific target genes were identified in the roots and shoots, respectively. To understand the functions of the DE-lncRNAs under water stress and during recovery, we analysed the GO terms and KEGG pathway associated with the target genes, which were mainly enriched for stress-related categories. For example, &#x02018;phenylpropanoid pathway&#x02019; and &#x02018;plant hormones&#x02019; play crucial roles in the response to abiotic stress and were regulated by lncRNAs under water stress and during recovery in <italic>C. songorica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This indicated that lncRNAs play an important role in drought resistance mechanisms in <italic>C. songorica</italic>. To determine the similarity and differences between water stress and recovery in <italic>C. songorica</italic>, the significant enriched GO terms were compared, and 17 common GO terms were found between the different treatments and organs. There were more specific GO terms for water stress than during recovery in the shoots, but the opposite was true in the roots. This showed that there were differences in responses to water stress in the roots and shoots. For example, CS shoots were involved in photosynthesis, signal transduction, and transport process. In contrast, the CS root was enriched for tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic and metabolic, response to extracellular and external stimulus.</p><p id="Par43">TFs are proteins that affect many biological processes including growth, development, cell division and response to environment stimuli, stressors in cells or organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. There was also a regulatory relationship between lncRNAs and TFs. For example, phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3) encodes a member of the (bHLH) TFs family. LncRNA HID1 (HIDDEN TREASURE 1) was shown to be an important player in seeding photomorphogenesis by modulating PIF3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In this study, 189 TFs corresponded to 163 DE-lncRNAs in <italic>C. songorica</italic>; for example, a bZIP gene was predicted to be a MSTRG.17203.1 target gene. Additionally, <italic>C. songorica</italic> genes homologues to rice genes, including <italic>Os03g60080</italic>(<italic>SANC1</italic>), <italic>Os01g66120</italic>(<italic>SANC2</italic>/<italic>OsNAC6</italic>), <italic>Os11g03300</italic>(<italic>OsNAC10</italic>), <italic>Os08g06140</italic>, <italic>Os05g34830</italic> and <italic>Os03g04070</italic>(<italic>ONAC022</italic>), were found to be involved in improving the drought stress tolerance of transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Five genes from the bZIP family were homologues of two rice genes (<italic>LOC_Os08g36790</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os06g10880</italic>), also called <italic>OsbZIP66</italic> and <italic>OsbZIP46</italic>, respectively, which had been demonstrated to improve drought tolerance in rice plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In rice, these genes function within Module 10 and have been identified as involved in protein post-translational modification and the protein amino acid phosphorylation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this study, these putative <italic>C. songorica</italic> DEGs orthologues were also mainly involved in phosphorylation in this module.</p><p id="Par44">The expression patterns of orthologues in syntenic genomic blocks are likely to be correlated across species in the Poaceae family. Importantly, 617 pairs of orthologues were common between foxtail, sorghum, rice and <italic>C. songorica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. These orthologues may be a core group of evolutionarily conserved genes associated with drought stress. These conserved genes included 81 DE-lncRNAs target genes and 15 TFs. Strikingly, 5 conserved genes belonged to the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) TF family. Expression of the HD-Zip I genes were regulated by abiotic stress and hormones such as ABA and ethylene. <italic>OsHOX22</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os04g45810</italic>) and <italic>OSHOX24</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os02g43330</italic>), which belong to the HD-Zip I family, were found to be differentially expressed under abiotic stress conditions in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Over-expressed <italic>OSHOX24</italic> enhanced the susceptibility to abiotic stress in transgenic rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Transgenic rice over-expressing <italic>OSHOX22</italic> showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA contents, and decreased drought and salt tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In this study, two conserved genes were homologous to <italic>OSHOX24</italic> and <italic>OSHOX22</italic>. Osmotic adjustment substances in plants such as soluble proteins, soluble sugars and proline were increased, which can improve plant drought resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Our results showed that 8 conserved DEGs participated in proline metabolism. Strikingly, these DEGs were upregulated under water stress. Four conserved DEGs acted as DE-lncRNA target genes and were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism. The ABA signalling pathway was central to drought stress responses in plants. PP2Cs can be considered as ABA co-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Three DE-lncRNA target genes (two PP2C genes) were enriched for the plant hormone signal transduction pathway. ABA transportation required specific uptake transporters. Most ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins were integral membrane proteins and acted as ATP-driven transporters for a wide range of substrates, including lipids and auxin. For example, ABCG40 is a plasma membrane ABA uptake transporter in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Stomata from <italic>abcg40</italic> mutants respond more slowly to ABA and the mutants showed decreased drought tolerance than wild plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Among these conserved genes, 18 conserved DEGs were involved in the ABA transporter pathway. Taken together, these results indicated that conserved genes play an important role in drought tolerance in <italic>C. songorica</italic>. ABA is the main plant hormone involved in responses to water stress. LncRNAs significantly participate in these important drought-resistant mechanisms in <italic>C. songorica</italic>.</p><p id="Par45">The miRNAs have been clearly shown to act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. LncRNAs can act as miRNA precursors as well as interact with miRNAs as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or through target mimicry (TM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, miRNA399 is efficiently modulated by <italic>IPS1</italic>, which serves as endogenous sponge able to sequester miRNA399 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Using bioinformatics, 52 lncRNAs were predicted to act as potential target mimics of conserved miRNAs in <italic>C. songorica</italic>. By analysing the expression of the lncRNA candidates and miRNA targets, one of these water stress-related lncRNAs (MSTRG.42613.1) was predicted to be a target mimic for miRNA164. It has been indicated that a decrease in miRNA164-target NAC genes causes drought tolerance in plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In this study, three miRNA164 NAC transcription factors were predicted as target genes. Auxin perception and signalling under normal growth conditions and during stress are regulated by miRNAs. TIR1 (transport inhibitor response1) is an auxin receptor that can be regulated by miRNA393. During stress, upregulated miRNA393 contributes to the repression of auxin signalling by promoting low TIR1 levels, leading to attenuation of plant growth and development under stress, and possibly promoting plant stress tolerance as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In this research, the lncRNA MSTRG.25585.13 was predicted to be a miRNA393 target mimic. Two miRNA393 target genes were annotated, including TIR1-like protein. There is significant ROS accumulation under abiotic stress conditions, which causes oxidative damage and eventually results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. However, recent work has indicated that ROS, especially H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is an important second messenger in signal transduction networks that regulate plant development. Laccases (LACs) belong to a large group of enzymes termed blue copper proteins, which include ascorbic acid oxidase and plastocyanin. A previous study has shown that <italic>OsLAC13</italic> can produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and is regulated by miRNA397 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In this study, seven miRNA397a/b target genes were identified as being from the LAC family, including 2 laccase-13, 2 laccase-3, 2 laccase-10 and 1 laccase-4. MSTRG.43964.1 was predicted to be miRNA393a/b target mimic. Plants laccases are well-known to participate in lignin synthesis. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>LAC4</italic> T-DNA insertion mutants have low lignin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].
