In our previous study, differential expression of meiosis-related miRNAs was found to be involved in the pollen sterility of autotetraploid rice. However, genome-wide DNA variations and methylomes associated with low fertility of autotetraploid rice are still poorly understood. Here, we measured both global DNA variations and the methylome and compared them with the transcriptome during pollen development in autotetraploid rice by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 34416 SNPs, 6993 InDels, 1003 SVs and 25 CNVs were detected, and 11367 and 41117 differentially methylated regions showed hypermethylation and hypomethylation in 02428-4x. In total, 1110 genes displayed differentially expression in 02428-4x during meiosis, of these six harbored CNVs, including four upregulated genes with gain CNVs, such as <italic>LOC_Os11g38620</italic>. We identified 122 genes by comparing with the previous data that might be associated with low fertility during pollen development in 02428-4x. Of the 122 gens, 98 were displayed methylation and differential expression, including <italic>OsMADS98</italic>, <italic>CYP703A3</italic> and <italic>OsABCG26</italic>. The downregulation of these three genes were confirmed by qPCR during meiosis of 02428-4x, which played pivotal roles in pollen fertility. These results indicate that the low fertility of autotetraploid rice is not only caused by the differential expression of genes involved in pollen development, but also by sequence variation and differential methylation, suggesting that the reason for pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice is complex and might be affected by multiple factors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-1745</contrib-id><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004000</institution-id><institution>Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201707020015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-1745</contrib-id><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Guangdong Science and Technology Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017A030303069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-1745</contrib-id><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiangdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China to XD Liu (31571625), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Key Program to XD Liu (201707020015), and the Guangdong Science and Technology Program to XD Liu (2017A030303069).

Autopolyploids show different phenotypes compared to their diploid progenitors, which might be caused by the duplicated genes retaining, losing, or acquiring new functions [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Though autopolyploidy may be advantageous for some agronomic traits, it also comes with challenges during meiosis due to the increase in chromosome numbers [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm resource generated by chromosome doubling; however, autotetraploid rice presents low fertility, which becomes the main bottleneck for its utilization. Partial pollen sterility is one of the main reasons for the low fertility of autotetraploid rice [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cytological observations have revealed that abnormal chromosome behavior and microtubule patterns act synergistically in the pollen sterility of autotetraploid rice [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Transcriptome analyses have revealed that irregularity of some pivotal genes, such as <italic>Os11g0146800</italic> (<italic>OsDMC1B</italic>) and <italic>Os09g0506800</italic> (<italic>PAIR2</italic>), may cause abnormal meiosis and lead to low pollen fertility of autotetraploid rice [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, differentially expressed patterns of miRNAs, phasiRNAs, and TE-siRNAs during development have been identified in autotetraploid rice, and some meiosis-related miRNAs are involved in low pollen fertility [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, genome-wide DNA variations and methylomes associated with low fertility in autotetraploid rice are still poorly understood, and little information is available concerning comprehensive analyses combined with DNA polymorphism, methylome and transcriptome data from the same field.</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology represents a powerful tool that can be used to discover abundant DNA polymorphisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion&#x02013;deletion polymorphisms (InDels), in mutated individuals [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, Yan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that rice mutants exhibited abnormal spikelets or male sterility as well as SNPs in important meiosis-related genes. Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA by monoclonal antibodies specific to 5-methylcytidine sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) can be used to detect methylated DNA in whole genomes and has been utilized in rice, maize and poplar [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hypermethylation was identified in PA64S (sterile) rice compared to PA64S (fertile); and 1258 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between them [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>To date, combinations of multiomic techniques have greatly promoted research in plants such as <italic>Paulownia</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and rice [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and even in polyploids [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Asymmetrical changes in small RNAs, transposons and gene expression between two resynthesized wheat allotetraploids can explain the evolution of wheat allotetraploids [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found that the increasing methylation of class II transposable elements (TEs) in autotetraploid rice could suppress the expression level of nearby genes in response to genome dosage effects. In addition, by using a multiomic analysis, Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that rice interploidy crosses could disrupt gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and even seed development. Hence, integrating multiomic results are useful in polyploid plant studies.</p><p>Although information on the cytogenetics and transcriptomes of autotetraploid rice is available [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], no study has addressed how multiple factors affect pollen fertility in autotetraploid rice. Here, an autotetraploid rice, 02428-4x, and its diploid counterpart (02428-2x) were used for resequencing via NGS to detect DNA methylation by MeDIP-Seq, to analyze the differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing, and then to reveal the male sterility-related genes. Finally, comprehensive analyses of DNA polymorphisms, the methylome and the transcriptome associated with sterility were carried out to identify the factors involved in the low pollen fertility of autotetraploid rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Rice material</title><p>Autotetraploid rice, 02428-4x, was obtained from the chromosome doubling of 02428-2x (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. subsp. <italic>japonica</italic>) by colchicine and was self-crossed for more than 27 generations in our lab [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The leaves of two-week-old seedlings of 02428-4x and 02428-2x were collected for resequencing, and the genomic DNA was extracted by using the modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Anthers at pollen meiosis stage were collected from both lines and stored at -80&#x000b0;C for transcriptome sequencing and methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). Anther at the premeiotic interphase and single microspore stage were collected for digital gene expression profiling.

The anthers were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (70%, 80%, 90% and 95% ethanol) for 30 min each.

The transverse section of the anthers was sectioned by a Leica RM2235 manual rotary microtome with a thickness of 3 &#x003bc;m.

The cleaved RNA fragments were then reverse-transcribed to construct a final cDNA library according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions of the mRNA-Seq sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Finally, we performed paired-end sequencing with an average insert size of 300 bp (&#x000b1;50 bp) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (LC Sciences, Hangzhou, China) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended protocol. After sequencing, the low-quality reads, reads containing sequencing adaptors, reads containing sequencing primers, and reads containing nucleotides with quality scores lower than 20 (Q&#x0003c;20) were removed. The clean reads were subsequently aligned to the <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> genome (MSU V7.0) using the TopHat package. The aligned reads were then used to assemble transcripts of each sample independently using the Cufflinks program [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The aligned reads were further processed by Cufflinks, which uses the normalized RNA-Seq fragment counts to measure the transcript relative abundances.

First, we sonicated anther DNA to produce random fragments ranging in size from 150 to 800 bp using an AIR&#x02122; DNA Fragmentation Kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, Texas, USA). Based on the Illumina manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended protocol, we then end-repaired, phosphorylated and A-tailed the fragmented DNA and ligated the adapters. The adaptor-ligated DNA was subsequently subjected to MeDIP enrichment using a MethylMiner&#x02122; Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Life Technologies, New York, USA). The efficiency of enrichment was checked by real-time quantitative PCR. Then, PCR amplification was performed, and target bands were excised from the gel to produce libraries; these libraries were quantified using an Agilent 2100 analyzer. Finally, MeDIP-Seq was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (LC Sciences, USA). The raw data of low-quality reads were filtered after sequencing, and clean data were mapped and assembled onto a reference genome (MSU V7.0).

These results suggested that next-generation sequencing technology can be a powerful tool for mining DNA polymorphisms [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], even in polyploid plants [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, few homozygous SNPs/InDels (0.45%) were identified in autotetraploid rice compared to the diploids, and only eight genes were related to major impact mutations and missense mutations, which suggest that there are few homozygous SNPs/InDels between autotetraploid rice and diploid rice after autopolyploidization. In addition, these eight homozygous polymorphic genes did not show distinct functions in the meiosis of autotetraploid rice, demonstrating that they might play other roles in autotetraploid rice, except <italic>LOC_Os09g37270</italic> (<italic>OsRacGEF1</italic>). <italic>OsRacGEF1</italic> is involved in chitin-triggered immune responses and resistance to rice blast infection [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but its role not yet reported in fertility. This gene, which was involved in megagametogenesis, showed missense mutation (arginine to histidine) in autotetraploid rice, and SNP was monitored by Sanger sequencing. Does this gene might affect the low fertility in autotetraploid rice? It requires further investigations. Moreover, most of the SNPs/InDels in autotetraploid rice were associated with heterozygosity. This phenomenon may be due to the four chromosomes in autotetraploid rice having heterozygous loci in 1:3 or 2:2 distributions. It is unknown whether these heterozygous loci can interact or not, regulate gene expression and play roles in autotetraploid rice; therefore, additional studies are needed. Beside, many low fertility-related genes associated with SVs/CNVs in autotetraploid rice. Five genes showed positive correlation with CNVs and qPCR results have revealed marked expression changes in these genes (i.e., <italic>LOC_Os11g38620</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os11g38630</italic>). The gained CNVs of these two meiosis stage-specific genes could change their differential expression levels in 02428-4x, which implied that the CNV might affect autotetraploid rice and cause undesirable traits. Therefore, we should focus on SVs/CNVs in follow-up studies of autotetraploid rice.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>The hypomethylation of DMR (differentially methylated regions) of autotetraploid rice might cause genome instability or abnormal gene transcription in anthers during meiosis</title><p>Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that the DNA methylation patterns were highly similar in three different ploidy (monoploid, diploid and triploid) rice lines, implying that ploidy may not have a widespread influence on DNA methylation. These findings were different from those in our study, in which ~80% of DMRs exhibited hypomethylation in autotetraploid rice compared to diploid rice. The hypomethylated DMRs were spread in every region (promoter, exon, intron and intergenic regions). Gene methylation serves to repress unintended transcription for efficient transcriptional elongation [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The hypomethylation in autotetraploid rice might be associated with unintended transcription initiation, which hinders the successful transcription of the gene. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>ROS1</italic> is a major DNA demethylase that erase DNA methylation for gene transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We hypothesized that autotetraploid rice might have a gene that function as <italic>ROS1</italic> causing DNA hypomethylation after polyploidization. In addition, a high number of hypermethylated DMRs were located in the promoter regions, which demonstrated where the negative regulation of the gene transcribed starts and subsequently cause lower expression levels of some important genes in autotetraploid rice, such as low fertility-related genes. The relationship between the gene expression and methylation level was not linear in our study; 109 of 254 DEG-DMR pairs showed negative regulation. This result was consistent with the previous MeDIP-seq studies [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], such as Hu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that down-regulated genes did not show significant hypermethylation. The negative regulations of DEG-DMR pairs might due to other regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA hypermethylation of DNA methylation monitoring sequence (MEMS) in the promoter of the <italic>ROS1</italic> could concomitantly increase <italic>ROS1</italic> expression [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, TEs associated with hypomethylation during meiosis in autotetraploid rice anthers were identified in the present study. Polyploidization could increase genetic mutations and changes in gene regulation due to the increases in TEs [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Hypomethylation of TEs may cause transposable element mobilization in young panicles at meiosis stage of PA64S (rice sterility line) [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, we found that more than 80% of the differentially expressed 24 nt TEs-siRNAs (siRNAs associated with TEs) exhibited downregulation during pollen development of autotetraploid rice (same materials) and may activate TEs and induce genome destabilization [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These findings suggest that the irregular TEs associated with hypomethylation and downregulation of 24 nt TE-siRNAs results in an autotetraploid rice incompatibility response to &#x0201c;genomic shock&#x0201d; by polyploidization and probably disturbs chromatin structure during autotetraploid rice meiosis. However, we cannot detect the 3448 TEs genes&#x02019; expression levels in transcriptome. We speculated that the TEs have already triggered from these TE genes and transposed to other genes; or these TE genes were inactive in these materials. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also described that the methylation level of TEs is different between autotetraploid rice panicles and those of their diploid counterpart; hypermethylated class II TEs have been reported in autotetraploid rice. However, these results are drastically different from our results. This difference is probably due to the different subspecies (<italic>japonica</italic> vs. <italic>indica</italic>) and tissues (anthers vs. panicles) in each experiment, and the WGD of rice needs to be further studied.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>The important genes related to DNA sequence variations, DNA methylations and differential expression patterns in autotetraploid rice might be co-associated with pollen sterility</title><p>In the present study, 122 genes were found to be related to low fertility in autotetraploid rice by comparing with the pollen/tapetum/meiosis-related genes and meiosis stage-specific genes [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

The abnormal changes of these genes might affect anther development in autotetraploid rice, such as <italic>LOC_Os01g68560</italic> (<italic>OsMADS98</italic>, MADS-box family gene with M-beta type-box) which displayed specific down-regulation and hypomethylation (Promoter) in autotetraploid rice. MADS-box genes play pivotal roles in the process of anther and pollen development [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. MIKCc-type box genes (<italic>OSMADS3</italic> and <italic>OSMADS58</italic>) are crucial for regulating floral meristem determinacy [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and dysfunctions of these genes cause severe abnormalities in floral meristem. MIKC*-Type MADS box genes (<italic>MADS62</italic>, <italic>MADS63</italic> and <italic>MADS68</italic>) required for pollen maturation [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and knockdown or knockout lines showed severe defects in pollen maturation of rice. In addition, <italic>OsMADS98</italic> was also associated with the combined effect of polyploidy and pollen sterility loci interactions (IPE) and down-regulated in autotetraploid rice hybrid, which cause meiosis abnormalities and pollen sterility [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Here, the downregulation of <italic>OsMADS98</italic> in autotetraploid rice was confirmed by qPCR. These findings suggest that MADS-Box gene, <italic>OsMADS98</italic>, is important in autotetraploid rice, and its abnormal expression might hinder the procession of anther development in autotetraploid rice and cause male sterility.</p><p>Some important genes related to pollen sterility were also identified, including <italic>LOC_Os08g03682</italic> (<italic>CYP703A3</italic>), which was annotated as cytochrome P450 and was specifically downregulated and hypomethylated (Promoter), and <italic>LOC_Os10g35180</italic> (<italic>OsABCG26</italic>), which encodes white-brown complex homolog protein 11 and displayed downregulation and hypomethylation (Exon and Intron) during meiosis of autotetraploid rice. <italic>CYP703A3</italic> was highly expressed in the tapetum and weakly expressed in the microspores from stage 8 to stage 10 of anther development [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although no apparent tapetum defect was found in the <italic>cyp703a3</italic> mutant, the product of <italic>CYP703A3</italic> serves as a backbone between the tapetum and pollen wall and is important for anther cuticle development and sporopollenin synthesis in rice. <italic>OsABCG26</italic> protein is localized on the plasma membrane of anther wall layers and is responsible for the transport of wax and cutin precursors from the tapetum to the anther surface [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Abnormal tapetal cells, persistent middle layers, collapsed microspores, and deeply stained debris in anther locules were identified in the <italic>osabcg26</italic> mutants. Two genes were involved in protein-protein interacted regulatory networks during meiosis in autotetraploid rice, and the downregulation of these genes was confirmed by qPCR. Moreover, the tapetum genes, <italic>LOC_Os10g03660</italic> (<italic>OsADF</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and <italic>LOC_Os05g47446</italic> (<italic>OsPDCD5</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], also displayed DNA polymorphisms, DNA methylation or differential expression patterns in autotetraploid rice. Approximately 30% of abnormal tapeta were detected during autotetraploid rice anther development compared to diploid rice by semi-thin sections. These results mirrored the abovementioned differential expression pattern of the tapetum genes, which demonstrated that abnormal expression of tapetum genes might cause tapetum defects in autotetraploid rice. Moreover, <italic>osa-miR2275</italic> and 24 nt-phasiRNAs preferentially accumulate in the tapetum and meiocytes of maize [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Downregulated 24 nt-phasiRNAs showing similar spatial-temporal expression patterns as those of <italic>osa-miR2275d</italic> were found during meiosis in 02428-4x anthers [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which implied that abnormal tapeta and tapetum genes might lead to irregular 24 nt-phasiRNAs and aggravate pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice.</p><p>Moreover, <italic>LOC_Os11g38620</italic> and <italic>LOC_Os11g38630</italic> combined with gain CNVs exhibited differential expression patterns in autotetraploid rice. Even though the function of these genes is largely unknown, they showed stage-specific expression during meiosis in rice. The function of these gene related to low fertility of autotetraploid rice should be further investigated. 122 genes could be elite male sterility genes that could be used for further studies about autotetraploid rice. However, the changes in gene expression between methylation levels and DNA polymorphisms are different and complex in autotetraploid rice. These changes might be regulated by another mechanism or regulators, such as long noncoding RNAs or circular RNAs, to respond to polyploidy effects.</p><p>Overall, a low seed set (~15%) as well as poor pollen fertility (~43%) and abnormal chromosomal behavior (~20%) in 02428-4x was reported in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These phenomena represent one reason for the low fertility caused by cytogenetics. Furthermore, abnormal tapeta (~30%) detected during anther development in 02428-4x further intensified pollen sterility. Various pollen/meiosis/tapetum-related genes and meiosis stage-specific genes were associated with different regulatory mechanisms; some showed DNA variation, some displayed differential expression, and some exhibited methylation in autotetraploid rice, even regulated by small RNAs [<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Abnormal variations/expressions/methylations of low fertility-related genes cause sterile phenotype in autotetraploid rice.
