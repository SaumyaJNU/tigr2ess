    "OBJECTIVE:The goal of this study was to evaluate kenaf as a roughage source in vitro and its effects on meat quality of Hanwoo (Korean native) cattle. METHODS:Three roughage materials, rice straw silage, ryegrass silage, and kenaf silage, were tested in a batch culture and feeding trial. Rumen fermentation parameters, including gas, pH, volatile fatty acid (VFA), and ammonia were analyzed. In the feeding trial, Hanwoo steers (373.5Â±5.1 kg, n = 36, 11 month of age) were divided into three feeding groups (n = 12 each). Animals were fed with each silage and concentrate until the fattening stage. RESULTS:Crude protein, ether extract, and non-structural carbohydrates were greater in kenaf silage. Total gas production was higher in ryegrass silage, followed by kenaf silage and rice straw silage (p<0.05). Total VFA and individual VFA (acetate, propionate, and n-butyrate) were greater in kenaf silage than rice straw silage (p<0.05). In vitro dry matter digestibility showed a similar trend to that of total gas and VFA production; it was higher in ryegrass silage and lower in rice straw (p<0.05). Throughout the feeding trial, the rice straw silage group showed significantly greater average daily gain than did the others (p<0.05). The feed conversion ratio in the group fed kenaf silage was significantly greater than that of others (p<0.05). No significant differences were observed in yield or quality traits, including carcass weight, ribeye area, backfat thickness, and scores for marbling, meat color, and fat color (p>0.05). CONCLUSION:The results indicated that no negative effects on growth performance and carcass characteristics occurred across treatments. Therefore, kenaf could be substituted for rice straw, which is most widely used as a roughage source in Korea."
