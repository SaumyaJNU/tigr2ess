Food insecurity is a particular concern for pregnant women and lactating mothers. Women who are pregnant have higher nutritional needs than when not pregnant to meet the high demands of the growing fetus. Furthermore, because pregnancy is physically demanding, pregnant women may have greater difficulty acquiring and preparing nutritious food and have lower capacity to work, exacerbating food insecurity and its consequences (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Food insecurity may be associated with risk of low birth weight and some birth defects (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Food insecurity among pregnant women and mothers is associated with stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, which may in turn affect parenting practices and infant development (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>Antenatal care is a common healthcare intervention for pregnant women across the globe, although coverage is inadequate in many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where fewer than half of pregnant women receive &#x02265;4 of the recommended 8 visits with skilled health personnel (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Antenatal care provides 4 basic functions for pregnant women: confirming health of the fetus and woman; preventing and monitoring medical complications; building supportive provider relationships; and educating and preparing for the pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum periods (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Antenatal care also provides a potentially important means through which to achieve complementary goals for well-being and health through use of risk assessment, health promotion, and clinical and psychosocial interventions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). For example, as shown in a prior quasi-experimental design, antenatal care may be a means through which to reduce food insecurity in the pregnancy and postpartum periods through behavioral and social interventions that do not provide food or money (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Other evidence that food security can be improved through behavioral and social intervention comes from a study in Honduras and studies of the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education program for low-income populations in the United States. In Honduras, a nutritional-counseling intervention delivered by peers to antiretroviral therapy patients with diverse nutritional status was evaluated through use of a pre- and posttest design. The intervention was associated with increased dietary quality and decreased food insecurity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The program in the United States was found to be cost-beneficial, with the benefits including reduced food expenditures, higher intakes of nutrients, adding less salt, reading nutrition labels more often, and running out of food at the end of the month less often (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Food insecurity decreased significantly more in graduates than in terminated participants, with a dose-response relation between the number of lessons received and decreases in food insecurity (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In a randomized design, a behavioral score constructed from items on diet quality, food safety, food security, and food resource management showed differential improvement over 2 mo (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Also, a cross-sectional survey showed that greater financial management skills in households was associated with less food insecurity, suggesting that improving these skills could reduce food insecurity (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The Alive &#x00026; Thrive initiative worked with BRAC, a large nongovernmental organization, to integrate multiple nutrition interventions into BRAC's existing Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health (MNCH) program in Bangladesh, a country in which maternal and child undernutrition is pervasive (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This nutrition-focused MNCH package improved maternal dietary diversity and micronutrient supplement consumption during pregnancy, improved exclusive breastfeeding practices, and increased the frequency of monitoring of maternal weight gain compared to the standard MNCH package (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The nutrition-focused MNCH package intended to improve knowledge of decision-makers in the household about the importance of nutrition for pregnant and lactating women and to encourage allocation of resources to ensure sufficient quality and quantity of foods in the household. Interpersonal communication and community mobilization involving men and other community members focused on improving women's diets during pregnancy and the early postnatal period through greater purchase and availability of foods in the household. We hypothesized that these actions to increase the purchase and availability of foods in the household would lead, in turn, to greater household food security as reported by women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="SECT2-1"><title/><sec id="sec2-1-1"><title>Intervention</title><p>The nutrition-focused MNCH package was started in 10 subdistricts in August 2015 and continued until mid-2017. The intervention package, which included several components that could reduce food insecurity, was delivered through antenatal care visits with the use of interpersonal communication, community mobilization, and monitoring of weight gain, aiming to improve maternal nutrition by increasing maternal diet quality, micronutrient intake, and breastfeeding practices (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>For interpersonal communication, frontline workers (called Shasthya Kormi) and health volunteers (called Shasthya Sebika) were trained to counsel pregnant and recently delivered women (with children aged &#x0003c;6 mo) during regularly scheduled monthly antenatal care visits at the household. The frontline workers demonstrated a specific diet plan (both quality and quantity), provided free iron and folic acid and calcium supplements, measured weight, counseled on resting, engaged other family members to support pregnant women, and encouraged husbands and family members to make food readily available in the household, and, in turn, encouraged pregnant women to follow the recommended diet. The diet-planning sessions discussed consumption of nutrient-dense foods during pregnancy, such as fish or meat, egg, milk or milk products, green leafy vegetables, and yellow or orange fruits and vegetables in addition to rice and thick lentils. Appropriate portion sizes for these foods were discussed through use of counts, pictures, and a 250-mL bowl.</p><p>Community mobilization involved husbands&#x02019; forums and interactive video shows in the community. Husbands of pregnant women were invited to attend 2 forums, 1 each in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The husbands&#x02019; forums provided information about the importance of proper nutrition for women during pregnancy for the development of the fetus and importance of nutrition in the postpartum period; encouraged husbands to purchase diversified nutritious foods for their wives; and involved the husbands in ensuring intake of the recommended quantity of diversified foods, iron and folic acid tablets, and calcium tablets by wives. Video shows and interactive communication were carried out in the community on multiple nutrition topics, targeting pregnant women, their husbands and family members, local elites, village doctors, and government health workers. A theme in video shows featuring husbands and mothers-in-law was the importance and priority of ensuring the availability and intake of diverse and nutritious foods by pregnant women, even if necessitating trade-offs with meeting other needs or wants. For example, 1 video showed a woman giving her son some saved money to buy fish for his pregnant wife, and another video showed that a husband should cut down other costs for some time to buy nutritious food for his pregnant wife and that buying nutritious foods for pregnant women is the best use of saved money.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1-2" sec-type="subjects"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A cluster-randomized, nonblinded design was used to evaluate the impact of the nutrition-focused MNCH compared to the standard MNCH packages in Bangladesh (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Standard MNCH was provided in the control areas where home visits were less frequent, included much less nutrition content or emphasis, provided micronutrient supplements upon payment, and had no community mobilization.</p><p>Twenty subdistricts were randomly assigned to either the nutrition-focused MNCH or the standard MNCH package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Cross-sectional household surveys were conducted at baseline (2015) and endline (2016) in the same communities and at the same time of year (June to August). A total of 2000 recently delivered women with children aged &#x0003c;6 mo (1000/intervention group) and 600 pregnant women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (300/intervention group) were surveyed at each survey round. To obtain the samples, within each subdistrict, 5 unions and 2 villages within each union were randomly selected to yield a total of 200 villages. Villages were a mean size of 250 households. Within each village, a household census was conducted at baseline and endline to list pregnant women and mothers with infants &#x0003c;6 mo of age. We selected households for surveys with the use of systematic sampling beginning with a random seed as a starting point to yield the desired sample size per cluster.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile.

These items aimed to capture 3 main domains of household food insecurity: anxiety and uncertainty about the household food supply (1 item), insufficient quality (3 items), and insufficient quantity and its physical consequences (5 items). We calculated at baseline and endline the percentage of households that <italic>1</italic>) responded &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to a specific occurrence question, <italic>2</italic>) responded &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to any of the conditions in a specific domain, and <italic>3</italic>) were categorized as food-secure and mild, moderate, and severe food-insecure following the steps described in the published guide (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Women were asked at both baseline and endline whether anyone in the household received cash, food, or other types of social assistance, and also whether anyone in the household received a microcredit loan. Husbands were asked at endline if they were able to regularly (i.e., &#x02265;3 times/wk) buy each of 12 foods presented on a list.</p><p>We measured several maternal and household characteristics. Maternal variables measured were mother's age, religion, education, and occupation. Household variables measured were household size, number of children, and socioeconomic status, which was created by principal components analysis with the use of a set of items related to ownership of property (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1-4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The institutional review boards at the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Bangladesh Medical Research Council both approved this study.

Baseline differences between the 2 intervention groups in maternal and household characteristics were examined using linear regression models for continuous variables or logit regression models for categorical variables, accounting for subdistricts as a random effect through use of a cluster sandwich estimator (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>To examine the impact of the nutrition-focused MNCH package in comparison with the standard MNCH package, we used linear (for items and domains) and multinomial logit (for categories) regression models in an intent-to-treat analysis to test differences at endline after first confirming that there were no differences at baseline. Linear regression was used for items and domains because the coefficients estimated differences in prevalence; linear and logit models provide similar results when the distribution of the outcome is not extreme (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We accounted for variation among subdistricts through use of a cluster sandwich estimator, testing the coefficients with the standard error and denominator degrees of freedom that reflected the subdistrict level. Data analyses were intent-to-treat, and were performed with the use of Stata 14. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>For a robustness check, we re-ran analyses accounting for baseline measures of food security. The results were essentially the same; accounting for baseline measures slightly attenuated some differences between nutrition-focused and standard MNCH groups, but also decreased precision of estimates. Also, to examine possible bias in responses from social desirability, a subset of 5 questions that we adapted and used previously for this purpose was administered to women at endline (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The items addressed whether a woman gives up doing something because she does not think she has the ability, feels like not listening to people even if she knows they are right, gets irritated or annoyed by people who ask her to do something for them, is courteous to people who are unpleasant, and is willing to admit a mistake when she makes it. A social desirability score was created by adding up the number of responses indicative of a propensity to provide socially desirable answers, with a score of 0&#x02013;2 being considered low, 3&#x000a0;as medium, 4 as high, and 5 as very high social desirability. The food insecurity categories were tabulated by these score values to examine differences in reported food insecurity.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The nutrition-focused and standard MNCH groups were similar in terms of maternal and household characteristics at baseline for both recently delivered and pregnant women (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table&#x000a0;1</bold></xref>).

The reduction was consistent across all items, domains, and categories of food insecurity. The nutrition-focused MNCH package, which did not provide food, was delivered during routine antenatal care visits with the use of interpersonal communication and community mobilization that included several components with potential to reduce food insecurity. The package intended to improve knowledge of the decision-makers in the household (e.g., women, husbands, and mothers-in-law) about the importance for fetal development of nutrition for pregnant and lactating women and encouraged husbands in particular to allocate resources to ensure sufficient quantity and quality of food in the households.</p><p>We hypothesized that the package would increase the purchase and availability of foods in the household through improved knowledge, altered resource allocation, and use of savings, and that doing so would improve household food security. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. Compared with the standard MNCH group, in the nutrition-focused MNCH group women reported higher household food security and husbands reported greater likelihood of being able buy food items at endline. Recently delivered women in the standard MNCH group were more likely to report receiving cash, food, or other types of social assistance, which presumably would have improved their food security and thereby would have resulted in underestimation of the impact of the nutrition-focused MNCH package. Our examination of social desirability also suggested that any such bias would have underestimated the impact.</p><p>Given that women reported on the status of household food security, an alternative explanation for the impact on food security could be that women specifically benefited from increased purchase and availability of foods rather than all household members, and that their reporting of household food security was influenced by their personal better access to food. Of the 9 questions in the food security scale, 7 asked about &#x0201c;you or any household member,&#x0201d; 1 asked &#x0201c;did you worry that your household,&#x0201d; and 1 asked about &#x0201c;your household;&#x0201d; that is, all questions asked about the household but 8 of 9 included &#x0201c;you&#x0201d; as part of the question. A comparison of men's and women's responses to a 13-item scale measuring food insecurity in Bangladesh found 81% concordance on items and 69% concordance on classification of food insecurity into terciles with no overall bias (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These results, however, do not provide information about whether men and women would respond similarly if there were differences in household food insecurity as a result of an intervention. In northern Burkina Faso where there was strong seasonal fluctuation in food insecurity, the patterns of food insecurity over time that were reported by male household heads and women were concordant with reality and with each other (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In the nutrition-focused MNCH areas, coverage was high (&#x0003e;90%) for interpersonal communication, supplement provision, and weight-gain monitoring. In these areas, compared to the standard MNCH areas, training quality, knowledge of frontline workers, coverage of services, and quality of interpersonal communication were significantly improved (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition to improved quality and frequency of interventions delivered by frontline workers to women, the husbands of the women were simultaneously engaged in mobilizing household resources to improve food access and to shift social norms by encouraging women to consume more and better foods. These findings are evidence that the integration of nutrition interventions into the MNCH program was feasible and well-implemented, and suggest that exposure to the components of the interventions that might have been expected to reduce food insecurity was high.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with 2 prior studies conducted in the United States showing that nutritional assistance during pregnancy or programming through antenatal care can reduce food insecurity. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children is a nationally funded public-health program implemented by states to provide supplemental foods, referrals to health care, and nutrition education. A longitudinal study of the program found that, among women with prenatal severe household food insecurity, earlier participation (i.e., starting in the first or second trimester) was associated with lower odds of any postpartum household food insecurity compared to late participation (i.e., starting in the third trimester) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In the second study, which used a quasi-experimental design, women who chose to receive antenatal care in a series of group sessions (i.e., group care) rather than meeting with only an individual provider (i.e., standard individual care) were less likely to report food insecurity in late pregnancy and postpartum (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Among women who were initially food insecure, group-care participants were more likely to become food secure in these 2 periods compared with individual-care participants. Because group antenatal care provided health education and the opportunity for women to share experiences and knowledge, food security may have improved through increases in confidence and skills to manage household resources.</p><p>Food insecurity is a concern in all vulnerable populations because it is a powerful stressor that can result in physical hunger, stress, sadness, shame and stigma, social isolation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), disruptions in family cohesion (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and altered parenting (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Food insecurity is also a marker of scarcity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and other stressors such as poor sleep and cognitive overload (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), a strong mediator of poverty (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), associated with less use of healthcare services (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and a driver of a broad set of detrimental nutritional, psychological, social, and health outcomes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, reducing food insecurity during the pregnancy and postpartum periods when women are particularly vulnerable should be a high priority. Integration into ongoing antenatal care of social and behavioral nutrition interventions provides a potentially effective means to do so, without incurring the high costs of setting up new service-delivery channels and of providing supplemental food, in populations where limited resources can be directed towards accessing adequate and appropriate foods. Future studies are warranted in different contexts of the comparative and cost effectiveness of interventions to reduce food insecurity in the pregnancy and postpartum periods.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge data collection by Data Analysis and Technical Assistance, Ltd, Dhaka.
