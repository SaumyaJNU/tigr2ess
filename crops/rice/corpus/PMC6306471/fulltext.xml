Hexokinases play key roles in the primary carbon metabolism, where they catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose and fructose, but they have also been shown to be involved in glucose signaling in both yeast and plants. We have characterized the <italic>Klebsormidium nitens KnHXK1</italic> gene, the only hexokinase-encoding gene in this charophyte alga. The encoded protein, KnHXK1, is a type B plant hexokinase with an N-terminal membrane anchor localizing the protein to the mitochondrial membranes. We found that KnHXK1 expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> can restore the glucose sensing and glucose repression defects of the glucose-insensitive hexokinase mutant <italic>gin2-1</italic>. Interestingly, both functions require a catalytically active enzyme, since an inactive double mutant was unable to complement <italic>gin2-1</italic>. These findings differ from previous results on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtHXK1 and its orthologs in rice, where catalytic and glucose sensing functions could be separated, but are consistent with recent results on the rice cytoplasmic hexokinase OsHXK7. A model with both catalytic and non-catalytic roles for hexokinases in glucose sensing and glucose repression is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hexokinase</kwd><kwd>glucose repression</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>glucose signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Vetenskapsr&#x000e5;det<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004359</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">2011-6004</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">2016-05180</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004063</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">2015.0056</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="60"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>For all cells, whether they exist as single cells or as a part of a multicellular organism, it is vital to be able to sense if there are nutrients available that can sustain their metabolism and growth. Sugars are important as carbon and energy sources, but they also have regulatory roles in many organisms, controlling metabolism, stress resistance, growth and development (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2001</xref>). In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the favored carbon and energy source glucose is sensed by several pathways. One is the glucose repression pathway, which involves the Snf1 protein kinase, the major hexokinase Hxk2 and the glucose repressor Mig1 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Entian, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Ronne, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hohmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Johnston, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2002</xref>). Snf1 is activated in the absence of glucose and phosphorylates both Hxk2 and Mig1, which causes their exclusion from the nucleus. In the presence of glucose, Snf1 is less active, and Hxk2 and Mig1 can move into the nucleus and form a repressing complex with Snf1 on the promoters of glucose-repressed genes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahuatzi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2012</xref>). Within this complex, Hxk2 masks a serine in Mig1 that is phosphorylated by Snf1, thus protecting Mig1 from phosphorylation and nuclear export (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Pelaez et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This regulatory function of Hxk2 is independent of its catalytic activity as shown by mutations that abolish either activity. Thus, the Hxk2<sub>wca</sub> mutant (<underline>w</underline>ithout <underline>c</underline>atalytic <underline>a</underline>ctivity), with a substitution of serine-304 to a phenylalanine and a small C-terminal truncation, is catalytically inactive but mediates glucose repression. In contrast, the Hxk2<sub>wrf</sub> mutant (<underline>w</underline>ithout <underline>r</underline>egulatory <underline>f</underline>unction), which lacks amino acids 6&#x02013;15 in the N-terminus, is catalytically active but unable to mediate glucose repression (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Pelaez et al., 2010</xref>). The Hxk2<sub>wrf</sub> mutant is also unable to bind to Mig1, indicating that this interaction is important for the regulatory role of Hxk2. How Snf1 is inactivated in the presence of glucose is not fully understood, but Snf1 binds ADP which is generated under low energy conditions such as the absence of glucose (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2011</xref>). This interaction protects Snf1 against dephosphorylation and inactivation by protein phosphatase 1. Accordingly, Snf1 is regulated by the cell&#x02019;s energy level, similar to its animal homolog AMPK, the AMP-activated protein kinase (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Carling, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Also plant hexokinases have such a dual role (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2006</xref>; Claeyssen and Rivoal, 2007; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Sheen, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilera-Alvarado and Sanchez-Nieto, 2017</xref>). Early experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> suggested that hexokinase is involved in both glucose signaling and glucose metabolism (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Jang and Sheen, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sheen et al., 1999</xref>). The notion that hexokinase is a sugar sensor in plants was, however, questioned by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Halford et al. (1999a)</xref> who pointed out that alterations in hexokinase activity might simply affect the rate of metabolism of hexoses and therefore the production of ATP, and that the plant orthologs of Snf1/AMPK, the SnRK1 kinases, could mediate regulatory changes in response to altered ATP levels. See also further comments by <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Moore and Sheen (1999)</xref> and <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Halford et al. (1999b)</xref>.</p><p>Further support for a role of plant hexokinases in glucose sensing came from a screen for glucose insensitive mutants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Leon and Sheen, 2003</xref>). One such mutant called <italic>glucose insensitive 2-1</italic> (<italic>gin2-1</italic>) is allelic to one of the hexokinase genes in <italic>Arabidopsis, AtHXK1</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant has a nonsense mutation in <italic>AtHXK1</italic> that destabilizes the transcript and reduces the protein below detectable levels. It is defective in glucose sensing but not in glucose phosphorylation, which suggests that the other major hexokinase, AtHXK2, can provide catalytic activity but not the glucose sensing function of AtHXK1. Targeted mutagenesis of AtHXK1 showed that two mutations thought to cause catalytic inactivity, G104D and S177A, did not affect glucose sensing, thus providing support for the notion that the glucose sensing and catalytic activities of AtHXK1 can be separated (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 could complement the glucose signaling phenotype of the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant, and this ability was not affected when mutations corresponding to G104D and S177A were introduced into OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It was subsequently reported that small amounts of AtHXK1 can translocate into the nucleus where it forms a complex with two other proteins that usually are found outside the nucleus: the VHA-B1 subunit of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and the RPT5B subunit of the proteasome (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Significantly, <italic>vha-B1</italic> and <italic>rpt5b</italic> have similar glucose insensitive phenotypes as <italic>gin2</italic>, including a defect in glucose repression of the <italic>CAA</italic> (carbonic anhydrase) and <italic>CAB</italic> (chlorophyll a/b binding protein) genes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). This suggested that the nuclear complex might mediate glucose repression. Consistent with this, ChIP experiments showed that the AtHXK1 complex binds to the <italic>CAB2</italic> promoter. Furthermore, VHA-B1 was found to interact in a yeast 2-hybrid screen with two transcription factors, SCL3 and an unnamed MYB-like protein, and it was proposed that the complex may be recruited to glucose-responsive promoters by these and other transcription factors that bind to the complex (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). This model would be analogous to the role of the hexokinase nuclear complex in yeast.</p><p>There are, however, findings that are not easily explained by this model. Cyanobacterial glucokinase from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> can complement <italic>gin2-1</italic> with respect to both glucose-responsive growth phenotypes and glucose repression of the <italic>CAB</italic> and <italic>RBCS</italic> genes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>). It is unlikely that cyanobacterial glucokinase could participate in specific protein-protein interactions in the nuclei of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells since this prokaryotic enzyme is very distantly related to the eukaryotic hexokinases (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>). More recently, the rice cytoplasmic hexokinase OsHXK7 was shown to complement both the glucose sensing and glucose repression defects of <italic>gin2-1</italic>, but unlike OsHXK5 and OsHXK6, this ability was dependent on its catalytic activity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that two hexokinase-dependent glucose signaling pathways with similar or identical targets exist in plants, one that requires the catalytic activity of hexokinase, and one that does not.</p><p>An interesting question is if glucose signaling is found in all streptophytes, i.e., the land plants (embryophytes) and charophyte algae, or if it was a later development during the evolution of land plants. <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic> is a simple filamentous microalga that belong to the charophytes, the freshwater algae from which the land plants developed approximately 700 million years ago (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2012</xref>). Studies of <italic>K. nitens</italic> may therefore provide insights into plant evolution. We here report the characterization of the single hexokinase present in <italic>K. nitens</italic>. The protein, KnHXK1, has an N-terminal membrane anchor and is related to the membrane-associated type B hexokinases found in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and vascular plants (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, KnHXK1 localized to mitochondrial membranes when expressed in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> protoplasts. We further found that KnHXK1 can complement the glucose insensitive phenotype of the <italic>Arabidopsis gin2-1</italic> mutant and restore glucose repression of the photosynthetic <italic>CAA</italic> and <italic>CAB2</italic> genes. Interestingly, a catalytically inactive KnHXK1 mutant was unable to complement the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutation. These findings are consistent with recent results on the function of OsHXK7 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) but differ from previous results with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtHXK1 and its orthologs in rice (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2009</xref>). A model with both catalytic and non-catalytic roles for hexokinases in glucose sensing and glucose repression is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Growth Conditions</title><p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> wild type (Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic>, L<italic>er</italic>) and <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant (in the L<italic>er</italic> background) were obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Centre (ABRC), Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States.

The strain was originally isolated in a bog on Mors Island, Denmark.

We found that the genome sequence of the European <italic>K. nitens</italic> only could be partially aligned to that of the American strain, and that the sequences differ significantly within the aligned regions (unpublished). Based on this, we conclude that the European and American strains most likely are different species, even though both are annotated as <italic>K. nitens</italic> in the strain collections.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was grown at 22&#x000b0;C and 110 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> using a 16 h/8 h light/dark photoperiod. <italic>K. nitens</italic> and <italic>P. patens</italic> were grown on cellophane covered 0.8% agar plates containing BCD media (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al., 2000</xref>), supplemented with 5 mM ammonium tartrate.

Hexokinase is important both for the initial metabolism of glucose and other sugars, and for glucose signaling and glucose repression. Plants, being autotrophs, are not dependent on any other carbon sources than the CO<sub>2</sub> needed for carbon fixation. However, they can also utilize sugars and other organic compounds absorbed from the environment. Thus, we have previously shown that the moss <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> can grow on petri dishes containing glucose in the absence of light, and that this ability to use externally supplied glucose is dependent on the <italic>PpHKX1</italic> gene encoding the major hexokinase isozyme in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Unlike yeast, plants do not normally live in environments where external carbon sources are abundant, and one might therefore ask why they should have the ability to utilize them. One possibility is that this ability developed with multicellularity and the need to transport carbon from source to sink tissues. Alternatively, it is a much older trait that was present already in unicellular algae. In order to investigate how early in plant evolution the ability to absorb and metabolize external carbon sources emerged, we studied the growth of the charophyte microalga <italic>K. nitens</italic> on different carbon sources, both in the presence and in the absence of light. For these experiments, <italic>K. nitens</italic> was grown on plates supplemented with either 0.05 or 0.25 M of different carbon sources. The plates were incubated in constant light or in darkness for 1 month, after which growth was scored. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, we found that <italic>K. nitens</italic> is able to grow in the dark on all carbon sources tested except mannitol, which is a sugar that most organisms are unable to metabolize. However, <italic>K. nitens</italic> grew very poorly on 0.05 M galactose, and it failed to grow at the higher concentration of 0.25 M. The growth inhibitory effect of 0.25 M galactose was seen also in the presence of light, where growth does not require an external carbon source. This suggests that galactose is toxic to <italic>K. nitens</italic> at higher concentrations. We further note that higher concentrations of glucose and fructose also had a growth inhibitory effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, growth inhibition was not seen in the presence of 0.25 M sucrose, raffinose and mannitol, so it is not simply an osmotic effect. We conclude from these experiments that the ability to take up and metabolize external carbon sources is an ancient trait already present in simple charophyte algae.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Growth of <italic>Klebsormidium nitens</italic> on different carbon sources in light as well as in darkness. <italic>K. nitens</italic> was grown on BCD media with two different concentrations of glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose, galactose, or mannitol for 1 month in light as well as in darkness.

GFP was added at the C-terminal end in order to minimize interference with correct folding of KnHXK1. The fusion constructs were expressed from the <italic>CaMV35S</italic> promoter. The constructs were transformed into <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> protoplasts after which the pattern of GFP fluorescence was studied. Chlorophyll autofluorescence was used as a chloroplast marker. For both KnWT-GFP and KnCI-GFP, the GFP signal localized to ring-like structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that we have previously shown using MitoTracker staining to be mitochondria (Figure 5 in <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2011</xref>).

When the membrane anchor was removed (KnN&#x00394;-GFP) the GFP signal localized to the cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We conclude that KnHXK1 is targeted to mitochondrial membranes, and that the N-terminal membrane anchor is needed for this localization.

To show that KnHXK1 is an enzymatically active hexokinases we tested if it could complement a <italic>hxk1 hxk2 glk1</italic> triple mutant yeast strain, which lacks all three yeast hexokinase genes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hohmann et al., 1999</xref>). A cDNA encoding full-length KnHXK1 was cloned into pFL61, a yeast shuttle vector in which the insert is expressed from the <italic>PGK</italic> promoter (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Minet et al., 1992</xref>). The resulting plasmid was named pKnWT. We also cloned an N-terminally truncated version of the KnHXK1 cDNA that lacked the membrane anchor into pFL61, generating pKnN&#x00394; (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, we made plasmids containing the KnHXK1 cDNA with and without membrane anchors as above, but containing two point mutations, one in the ATP binding site were the conserved glycine was mutated into an aspartic acid (G110D), and one in the phosphoryl transfer site were the conserved serine was mutated into an alanine (S184A). These are the same two point mutations that were reported to independently of each other abolish detectable catalytic activity but still support glucose signaling and glucose repression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). We made a double mutant since experiments in yeast have shown that one of the two mutants (S158A in yeast Hxk2) is partially active with a relative <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of 10% toward glucose and 50% toward fructose, compared to the wild type (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kraakman et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore reasoned that a double mutant might be more stringently inactive than either single mutant. The resulting constructs expressing the catalytically inactive double mutant of KnHXK1, with and without the membrane anchor, were named pKnCI and pKnN&#x00394;CI.</p><p>We found that full length KnHXK1 as well as KnHXK1 lacking the N-terminal membrane anchor could complement the hexokinase-deficient yeast strain for use of both glucose and fructose as a carbon source (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This shows that KnHXK1 is an active hexokinase in yeast, and that KnHXK1 has a dual specificity for glucose and fructose. KnHXK1 also supports growth of the triple mutant strain <italic>hxk1 hxk2 glk1</italic> on raffinose. Both the wild type KnHXK1 and the mutant without membrane anchor support growth, but removing the membrane anchor seems to increase the hexokinase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, plasmids expressing the catalytic site double mutant KnHXK1, pKnCI, and pKnN&#x00394;CI, failed to complement the <italic>hxk1 hxk2 glk1</italic> strain for growth on glucose, fructose, or raffinose, as did the vector control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Similar to KnHXK1, AtHXK1 is a type B plant hexokinase that localizes to mitochondrial membranes. However, it also translocates to the nucleus in low amounts, where it is part of a complex that affects transcription (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2006</xref>).

To this end, we made three different constructs that express wild type or mutant versions of KnHXK1 from the <italic>CaMV35S</italic> promoter.

Lines expressing the membrane-anchor truncated KnHXK1 showed a wild type response to glucose in a majority of the seedlings, though the penetrance varied between different lines (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

There are several types of plant hexokinases: the type A hexokinases that possess chloroplast transit peptides that localize them to the chloroplast stroma, the type B and D hexokinases that have N-terminal membrane anchors and localize to the mitochondrial membranes and chloroplast envelopes, and finally the type C hexokinases that lack both membrane anchor and transit peptide and remain in the cytosol (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2011</xref>). The subcellular localizations of different hexokinases probably reflect different functions. The type B hexokinases have been proposed to be important in the supply of pyruvate to mitochondria. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, almost all enzymes in the glycolytic pathway are associated with the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gieg&#x000e9; et al., 2003</xref>). A likely reason why KnHXK1 localizes to mitochondrial membranes is therefore that it functions in supplying pyruvate to the mitochondria.</p><p>Since KnHXK1 is the only hexokinase that we found to be encoded by the <italic>K. nitens</italic> genome, it seems plausible that the type B hexokinase is the ancestral enzyme from which other types of plant hexokinases evolved. This would suggest that the primary function of plant hexokinases originally was to provide pyruvate to the mitochondria. However, it should be noted that in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, the type A hexokinase PpHXK1 which localizes to the chloroplast stroma is responsible for 80% of the glucose phosphorylating activity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>). This raises the question why <italic>K. nitens</italic> does not have a type A hexokinase. It is possible that the type A hexokinases arose as an adaptation in early land plants, since all land plants that have been examined possess type A hexokinases. This in turn raises the question what the advantage of having a hexokinase in the chloroplast stroma is, and why this should be more important to land plants. We have previously suggested that the type A hexokinases function in mobilization of glucose from starch stored in the chloroplasts (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson et al., 2011</xref>). This process may be more important in multicellular plants where carbon is redistributed between sink and source tissues. Alternatively, the switch from day to night requires a faster mobilization of glucose in land plants, which are more exposed to diurnal temperature changes.</p><p>Our findings that KnHXK1 can restore both glucose signaling (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) and glucose repression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) in the <italic>Arabidopsis gin2-1</italic> mutant and that the catalytic activity of KnHXK1 is necessary for this restoration differ from previous results on AtHXK1 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>) and its orthologs in rice (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2009</xref>), but are consistent with the finding that the ability of the cytoplasmic rice hexokinase OsHXK7 to complement <italic>gin2-1</italic> depends on its catalytic activity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). A trivial explanation for these differences would be if some catalytic activity is needed for all glucose signaling, and if the AtHXK1 single mutants (and their rice orthologs) are leaky, with some residual catalytic activity. We chose to make a double mutant in KnHXK1 in order to minimize the risk for leakiness, since studies in yeast have shown that the first mutant (S158A in yeast Hxk2) is partially active with a relative <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> of 10% for glucose and 50% for fructose (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kraakman et al., 1999</xref>), and since an HA-tagged version of the second mutant, AtHXK1-G104D, appeared to have a residual activity of about 5% of the HA-tagged wild type protein (Figure S3 in <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). However, both mutant proteins were completely inactive when purified as His-tagged proteins (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the results of <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2016)</xref> with OsHXK7 cannot be explained by leakiness since both single mutants in that case did abolish glucose signaling. We therefore think that leakiness of single mutants is an unlikely explanation for the differences between our results and those of previous studies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The question then arises why the ability of plant hexokinases to mediate glucose sensing and glucose repression is dependent on their catalytic activity in some cases (KnHXK1 and OsHXK7) and independent in other cases (AtHXK1, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6). First, we note that this difference does not seem to reflect these two groups of hexokinases being involved in different physiological responses. It has been suggested that different hexokinase-dependent responses to glucose exist in plants, some of which are dependent on the catalytic activity and some of which are not (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the glucose-induced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> defense genes <italic>PR1</italic> and <italic>PR5</italic> are induced in plants that overexpress either AtHXK1 or yeast ScHXK2, which suggests a dependency on hexokinase activity rather than on plant-specific glucose signaling (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, a different set of genes is repressed by the AtHXK1-dependent glucose signaling pathway, e.g., photosynthetic genes such as <italic>CAA</italic>, and these genes are not repressed by expression of ScHXK2 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>). However, we note that <italic>CAA</italic> is repressed by both OsHXK7 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) and KnHXK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) when expressed in the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant. Moreover, other phenotypes of the <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutant such as glucose insensitivity of plant seedlings and growth inhibition under high light conditions are also complemented by both OsHXK7 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) and KnHXK1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We conclude that KnHXK1 and OsHXK7 mediate the same physiological response to glucose as AtHXK1, OsHXK5, and OsHXK6, even though the former two but not the latter three are dependent on their catalytic activity.</p><p>Interestingly, a cyanobacterial glucokinase, cGlk, from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> could also complement the <italic>gin2-1</italic> defects in both glucose-responsive growth phenotypes and glucose repression of the <italic>CAB1</italic> and <italic>RBCS</italic> genes (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>). This is puzzling given the reported inability of yeast ScHXK2 to substitute for AtHXK1 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>) since the prokaryotic cGlk is much more distantly related to plant hexokinases than is ScHXK2 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>). One would therefore expect ScHXK2 to be able to provide any function in plants that cGlk can provide. However, we note that published results with ScHXK2 in plants involved expression of ScHXK2 in either wild type plants (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2000</xref>) or maize protoplasts (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Yanagisawa et al., 2003</xref>). The ability of ScHXK2 to complement <italic>gin2-1</italic> does not seem to have been tested. It also remains to be shown if the ability of cGlk to complement <italic>gin2-1</italic> depends on its catalytic activity.</p><p>It therefore seems likely that increased glucose phosphorylation and a resulting increase in metabolic intermediates or ATP could be the common mechanism responsible for the ability of KnHXK1, OsHXK7, and cGlk, and perhaps other hexokinases, to complement the glucose signaling and glucose repression defects of <italic>gin2-1</italic>. The fact that catalytically inactive mutants of AtHXK1 can trigger the same response (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2003</xref>) shows that a glucose signaling pathway that does not require hexokinase catalytic activity has evolved in at least some plants, but apparently the two pathways function in parallel and the same response can still be elicited by increased glucose phosphorylation. The question then arises why the other two catalytically active hexokinases in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtHXK2, and AtHXK3, cannot substitute for AtHXK1 in glucose signaling. This could be due to localization (AtHXK3 is a type A hexokinase that localizes to the plastid stroma) and/or expression levels. We note that KnHXK1, OsHXK7, and cGlk were all expressed from the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. Possibly, a high and stable level of expression is needed to sustain glucose signaling through increased glucose phosphorylation.</p><p>What mechanism could link glucose phosphorylation to changes in gene expression? An obvious candidate, as suggested by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Halford et al. (1999a)</xref>, is the Snf1 kinase, known as AMPK in animals and SnRK1 in plants. Snf1 is a global energy sensor that is activated by low energy conditions and replenishes the energy level by inducing catabolic energy-generating pathways and repressing anabolic pathways. Animal AMPK is activated by AMP and yeast Snf1 by ADP (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mayer et al., 2011</xref>). SnRK1 is not activated by either AMP or ADP, but is instead inhibited by glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P and in particular trehalose-6-P (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Barajas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Nunes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Emanuelle et al., 2016</xref>). However, the end result is the same: the kinase is activated during low energy conditions, and increased glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase will inactivate it. SnRK1 could therefore play a similar role in plants as Snf1 does in yeast, where hexokinase-dependent inhibition of Snf1 through increased glucose phosphorylation and a resulting decrease in ADP contributes to glucose repression even in the absence of a nuclear hexokinase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Such a model would be consistent with the findings that hexokinase and SnRK1 mutants have opposite phenotypes both in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Thelander et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baena-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="F11" position="float"><label>FIGURE 11</label><caption><p>Dual roles of hexokinase in glucose repression.

Less is known about nuclear interactions, but some hexokinases and SnRK1s are present in the nucleus and have been shown to associate with both transcription factors and target promoters. It is therefore possible that they could participate in regulatory interactions similar to those in yeast. As in yeast, SnRK1 is inactivated by increased glucose phosphorylation, though the mechanism involves inhibition of SnRK1 by sugar phosphates rather than its activation by ADP. It is not known if SnRK1 regulates nuclear transport of plant hexokinases. Nuclear transport is indicated by <italic>dashed arrows</italic>, positive effects by <italic>solid arrows</italic> and negative effects by <italic>solid T-bars</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01887-g011"/></fig><p>There are several ways to test this model. First, if glucose repression mediated by KnHXK1, OsHXK7 and cGlk is dependent on SnRK1, a knockout mutant devoid of all SnRK1 activity should block this effect. This could be tested in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>, where a <italic>snf1a snf1b</italic> double knockout is viable (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Thelander et al., 2004</xref>). Second, if nuclear SnRK1 functions downstream of hexokinase similar to Snf1 in yeast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>), a SnRK1-less mutant should be deficient in expression of glucose repressed genes such as <italic>CAA</italic> and <italic>CAB</italic>. We note that photosynthetic genes was one group of genes that was induced by overexpression of KIN10, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SnRK1 (Figure S1 in <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Baena-Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>), but the reverse question, i.e., to what extent the expression of these and other hexokinase-regulated plant genes is dependent on SnRK1 remains to be answered. Third, the effect of expressing ScHXK2 in plants should be re-examined. In particular, the question if ScHXK2 can complement the <italic>gin2-1</italic> phenotypes needs to be addressed. As noted above, published results on ScHXK2 in plants deal only with its expression in wild type plants and protoplasts. Fourth, the model predicts that the cyanobacterial glucokinase cGlk also should depend on its catalytic activity for the ability to complement <italic>gin2-1</italic>, similar to KnHXK1 and OsHXK7.</p><p>Finally, we note that catalytically active hexokinases might inhibit Snf1 and/or SnRK1 by other mechanisms that do not involve sugar phosphates or the glycolytic flux. This could explain our finding that KnHXK1 expressed in a hexokinase-deficient yeast strain can restore growth inhibition on non-fermentable carbon sources by 2-deoxyglucose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which is not metabolized beyond the phosphorylation step and thus does not increase the glycolytic flux. However, results obtained with glucose analogs should be interpreted with caution since the structural requirements for hexokinase-mediated signaling may vary in a substrate-dependent manner (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kraakman et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that the charophyte hexokinase KnHXK1 can complement the glucose signaling and glucose repression phenotypes of a glucose-insensitive <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> hexokinase mutant. We further found that these effects depend on the catalytic activity of KnHXK1, unlike the case for AtHXK1 and its rice orthologs, but similar to rice OsHXK7. We interpret these findings as evidence of dual roles for plant hexokinases in glucose signaling: (1) by specific interactions with transcription factors that work only between angiosperms (e.g., <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice), and (2) by effects on hexose phosphorylation and/or the glycolytic flux, which can be provided also by a distantly related hexokinases such as KnHXK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MU, DME, and HR conceived the study, designed the experiments, and wrote the manuscript.
