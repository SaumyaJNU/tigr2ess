Given the trend of increasing global temperatures, this sensitivity to higher temperatures poses a challenge for achieving global food security. Early seed development in rice is highly sensitive to unfavorable environmental conditions. Heat stress (HS) during this stage decreases seed size and fertility, thus reducing yield. Here, we explore the transgenerational phenotypic consequences of HS during early seed development on seed viability, germination, and establishment. To elucidate the impact of HS on the developmental events in post-zygotic rice seeds, we imposed moderate (35&#x000b0;C) and severe (39&#x000b0;C) HS treatments initiated 1 day after fertilization and maintained for 24, 48, or 72 h. The transient HS treatments altered the initiation of endosperm (ED) cellularization, seed size and/or the duration of spikelet ripening. Notably, seeds exposed to 24 and 48 h moderate HS exhibited higher germination rate compared to seeds derived from plants grown under control or severe HS. A short-term HS resulted in altered expression of Gibberellin (GA) and ABA biosynthesis genes during early seed development, and GA and ABA levels and starch content at maturity. The increased germination rate after 24 of moderate HS could be due to altered ABA sensitivity and/or increased starch level. Our findings on the impact of transient HS on hormone homeostasis provide an experimental framework to elucidate the underlying molecular and metabolic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>seed development</kwd><kwd>seed priming</kwd><kwd>ABA-GA crosstalk</kwd><kwd>endosperm</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is one of the most important crops for global food security. Together with maize and wheat, these three cereals provide more than 50% of the food calories for humans as well as livestock feed, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Rice is grown under a variety of environments with an estimated planted area of 161 million ha (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Seck et al., 2012</xref>). Current global climate predictions are expected to negatively impact rice production. It is estimated that increased temperatures will decrease rice production by up to 25% (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Wassmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">van Oort and Zwart, 2018</xref>). Two major factors causing decline in rice yield are: heat stress (HS) induced sterility and shortening of the growing season (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">van Oort and Zwart, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A shorter growing season could be particularly detrimental during the reproductive development. Increased temperatures following fertilization negatively affect grain development (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Folsom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Begcy and Walia, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Begcy and Dresselhaus, 2018</xref>). Accelerated seed development and reduced seed size are the most significant consequences of HS during early seed development (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Folsom et al., 2014</xref>). The process of grain filling, which involves nutrient accumulation in developing and maturing grains, is also sensitive to environmental conditions and has strong effects on final yield and quality (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Zhang, 2006</xref>). Early seed development entails an initial free nuclear stage (syncytial) and is followed by cellularization of endosperm (ED) nuclei. The cellularized ED continues to undergo mitotic divisions. The rate and duration of nuclear divisions and subsequent mitotic cell divisions are important determinants of sink capacity during grain filling stage. Environmental perturbations during the initial phases likely affect later stages of seed development and consequently grain size (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Several regulatory and metabolic pathways have been associated with abiotic stress induced seed development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Borisjuk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Whittle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Folsom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Begcy and Walia, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Most acute and sustained HS studies only report treatment effects on seed size and molecular network patterns for the generation in which the stress was applied (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Grass and Burris, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Folsom et al., 2014</xref>). The transgenerational impact of HS is much less characterized. HS during seed development significantly affects seed quality, dormancy, germination, and emergence as well as seedling establishment (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Khan, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Brunel-Muguet et al., 2015</xref>). Increased temperatures had a strong negative effect on seed germination potential and resulted in reduced seed viability and poor germination (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fahad et al., 2017</xref>). Decreased germination and seed vigor due to HS have been associated with reduced thermostability of the plasma membrane as well as membrane fluidity (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saidi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fahad et al., 2017</xref>), which delayed activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, kinases, and heat shock factors (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sangwan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saidi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Hormonal and other chemical treatments can improve seed germination, establishment, and seedling vigor through a process called seed priming. In rice, seed priming is used to achieve faster and more uniform emergence (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ruttanaruangboworn et al., 2017</xref>). Seed priming has agricultural applications and will likely gain more importance as farmers seek greater resilience in their production practices under shifting weather patterns. A better understanding of seed priming and its modes of activity would therefore be of considerable value. Two major phytohormones, ABA and Gibberellin (GA) play antagonistic role in response to stress and during normal plant development, especially during seed germination. Endogenous ABA and GA levels negatively and positively regulate seed germination, respectively (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Koornneef et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2000</xref>). A Comparison of dormant and non-dormant rice cultivars showed that ABA and GA exhibit dynamic fluxes during early, late and middle stages of seed development (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, exposure to HS can cause increase in ABA levels, while decreasing GA biosynthesis (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Toh et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of transient HS during early seed development on germination and seedling vigor of seeds derived from control and stressed plants. Our data suggest that the rate of seed germination depends upon the duration and intensity of thermal stress to which maternal plants were exposed. To understand the physiological mechanisms underlying altered germination, we examined the ABA, GA and starch contents of mature seeds. We also analyzed the temperature induced changes in expression of genes involved in GA and ABA metabolism during early seed development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Heat Stress Treatment</title><p>Rice seeds (<italic>O. sativa</italic> var.

After germination, seedlings were transplanted to field soil in 4&#x02032; square pots. Plants were grown in standing water under controlled conditions (27&#x02013;30&#x000b0;C) in the greenhouse until approaching anthesis. Plants were transferred to growth chambers 1&#x02013;2 days before panicle emergence with a 16 h-light/8 h-dark cycle (300 &#x02013; 400 &#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) at 28&#x000b0;C for non-stressed (NS) control conditions and 35 and 39&#x000b0;C for moderate and severe HS, respectively, and a relative humidity of 75 to 80%.</p><p>Unfertilized ovules were observed in the morning and then closely observed before the fertilization event. Closed spikelets with anthers located outside were then marked as fertilized by the afternoon. Plants were kept in control conditions until 24 h after fertilization (HAF) to assure that the marked seeds underwent a normal fertilization process and embryo and ED development processes have initiated. Post-fertilization HS was imposed for 24, 48, or 72 h. Only a few spikelets were collected from each plant. After the HS treatment, plants were moved back to the greenhouse and grown under control conditions until maturity for final seed phenotypic characterization. For all measurements, control and HS seeds were obtained from at least 20 plants for each of the five replicates. In rice, seed ripening involves changes in hull coloration from pale green to yellow-brown. Yellow-brown colored seeds were scored as ripened. For all seed ripening measurements, at least 20 plants in each of the four replicates from NS and HS seeds were used. Ripening rate was measured by scoring ripening every 4 days after fertilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Germination and Post-germination Assay</title><p>Surface-sterilized dehulled seeds were germinated on wet filter paper in dark.

Samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and infiltrated with xylene. Seed samples were embedded in paraffin (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, United States), sectioned at a thickness of 10 &#x003bc;m, and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue.

Freeze-dried rice grains were powdered in a tissue lyser (TissueLyser, Retsch, Qiagen) operating at 30 Hz for 60 s and passed through a 0.5 mm screen. Soluble sugars were removed by washing the samples in 80% (v/v) ethanol, in a boiling water bath for 30 min, then in 96% ethanol at room temperature for a final wash for 10 min. The supernatant was removed at the end of every step after centrifugation at 10,000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and the pellet was dried at 40&#x000b0;C.

A total of 0.2 mL of a mixture of amyloglucosidase (1630 U/mL) plus invertase (500 U/mL; from Megazyme assay kit, Cat. No. K-YBGL) was added immediately.

We observed that moderate HS (35&#x000b0;C) during early seed development significantly reduced the final seed size at maturity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The reduced size of HS seeds at 35&#x000b0;C was a result of reduced seed length, width, and weight in mature seeds (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>). We also observed embryo malformation in seeds HS for 72 h at 35&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Embryo malformation was characterized by irregular shape and reduced size relative to control seeds. Seeds exposed to severe HS (39&#x000b0;C) during early seed development exhibited variable degree of malformation at maturity. The duration of 39&#x000b0;C HS directly impacted the severity of mature seed phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The decrease in seed size after 24, 48, or 72 h at 39&#x000b0;C of HS was clearly reflected in reduced seed length, width, thickness, and weight at maturity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>). We observed a significant decrease in seed weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), indicating that even a short duration severe HS during early seed development results in collapse of ED.

These post-germination assay results indicate that 24 and 48 h HS seedlings were less sensitive to exogenous ABA.

We aimed to determine the level of transcriptional perturbation of GA and ABA pathway genes during the transient HS. The GA and ABA pathway genes that are differentially regulated between control and HS samples are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. The gene annotation information for these two hormonal pathways was obtained from GoMapMan (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Ram&#x00161;ak et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially expressed GA and ABA synthesis and catabolic pathway associated genes are represented as a heat map in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>. Moderate HS decreased the expression of GA biosynthesis genes (<italic>GA20ox2</italic> and <italic>GA3ox2</italic>) and increased the expression of genes encoding for GA catabolic enzymes (<italic>GA2ox7</italic> and <italic>GA2ox8</italic>). Expression of two ABA catabolic genes was higher in control and stressed samples at 48 HAF but was suppressed by 72 HAF. However, 24 h of moderate HS down-regulated another ABA catabolic gene, <italic>OsABA8ox2</italic> (<italic>LOC_Os08g36860</italic>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). In context of GA and ABA crosstalk, we found the response of OsAP2-39 to moderate HS to be noteworthy. OsAP2-39 is a APETALA2 (AP2) class family transcription factor known for its role in regulating the GA and ABA antagonistic crosstalk in rice. OsAP2-39 controls the ABA-GA homeostasis by positively regulating the key enzymes OsNCED-1 and EUI, involved in ABA biosynthesis and GA deactivation, respectively (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yaish et al., 2010</xref>). We found that expression of OsAP2-39 in developing seeds to be induced by more than two-fold in 48 h moderate stressed seeds relative to corresponding control seeds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). At least at the gene expression level, the transcript abundance of <italic>OsAP2-39</italic> is consistent with overall increase in ABA biosynthesis and decreased GA biosynthesis. It is pertinent to note that change in expression of <italic>OsAP2-39</italic> in transgenic rice also affects the seed size (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yaish et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with earlier reports, our data provides evidence that transient HS perturbs the antagonistic regulation of ABA and GA biosynthesis genes in young rice seeds.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Heat stress induces transcriptional changes in ABA and GA related genes <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold>.

However, ABA levels in the same samples were reduced, except for the 24 h HS seeds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

However, 48 h of HS seeds had much higher GA/ABA ratio than seeds exposed to 24 h HS.

At the morphological level, our study showed high heat sensitivity of rice ED during the syncytial stage (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which leads to precocious or delayed cellularization depending on stress severity. Understanding the effects of short periods of HS during early stages of seed development on mature seeds is necessary to improve tolerance and protect yield. Detrimental effects of HS were clearly observed on mature seeds (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and affected germination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and seedling establishment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Although an overall negative effect of HS on mature seeds was observed, seeds HS for 24 h displayed improved germination rate and seedling establishment in a manner similar to primed seeds.</p><p>A variety of seed priming methods including osmotic, chemical and plant hormones during pre-soaking, and other seed pretreatments have been shown to improve plant performance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Basra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ruttanaruangboworn et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, GA<sub>3</sub> and ethylene stimulated the elongation of embryonic tissues and internodes of rice seedlings while ABA promoted coleoptile elongation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). Another well-established seed priming method is the application of a dry heat treatment on seeds to interrupt seed dormancy and ensure better seed germination (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dadlani and Seshu, 1990</xref>). In cotton and rice, short incubation periods of seeds under elevated temperatures (60&#x000b0;C) markedly improved seedling emergence and vigor (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Basra et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Our transient moderate HS treatment during early seed development improved seed germination rate and advanced seedling establishment, suggesting that short-term episodes of HS enhance seed performance. Both ABA and GA pathways are perturbed at gene expression level after 24 and 48 h of moderate HS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is possible that the transient HS alters either the level or sensitivity of the seeds to ABA and/or GA, which persists in the next generation until hormone homeostasis is reestablished in response to developmental program and seedling&#x02019;s environment. Several studies have indicated that germination-related genes are activated and maintained by priming treatments, indicating the role of pre-germination metabolic steps in germination (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gallardo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Soeda et al., 2005</xref>). Natural or artificial seed priming induces the mobilization and solubilizes a variety of compounds necessary for seed germination (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Capron et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gamboa-deBuen et al., 2006</xref>). Among other pre-germination metabolic changes, seed priming decreased the level of organic compounds (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bailly et al., 1998</xref>), changed fatty acids contents (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Walters et al., 2005</xref>), and induced &#x003b1;-amylase production (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mwale et al., 2003</xref>). We observed an increased accumulation of total starch that may accelerate germination of 24 h HS seeds, resulting in enhanced emergence. ED storage, especially for starch is initiated once cellularization is complete (i.e., no CV persists). It is possible that precocious cellularization initiates early starch accumulation in 24 h HS seeds. However, early maturation of HS panicles observed in our experiments could potentially negate early cellularization enhancement for starch storage.</p><p>In cereals, the major storage compound is starch (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Shaik et al., 2014</xref>). Starch serves as the principal carbohydrate storage in most plants and can be rapidly mobilized to provide soluble sugars that can be used for germination and other metabolic processes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Shaik et al., 2014</xref>). Abiotic stresses lead to a depletion in starch content and, consequently, a rise in the accumulation of soluble sugars (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Krasensky and Jonak, 2012</xref>). We observed an altered germination speed and total starch accumulation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Seeds germinated from plants exposed to moderate HS (35&#x000b0;C) for 24 h, showed higher germination rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) which coincided with higher total starch content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Since most of the seed starch is remobilized to support germination (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>), this indicates a positive correlation between increased germination rate and the quantity of total starch available for the anabolic pathways required during germination and seedling establishment.</p><p>In non-climacteric fruits that have little or no ethylene requirement for ripening during fruit development, ABA has a stronger role; the decrease in auxin and the concomitant increase in ABA are significant events that signal the developmental transition to ripening (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2011</xref>). We observed an increase in ripening rate of 24 and 48 h HS spikelets suggesting a relation between accelerated speed in cellularization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and earlier ripening (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1A</xref>). Seeds that were HS for 24 h displayed higher ABA levels in mature seeds, which may indicate altered hormone balance on HS seeds. Our results show that 24 h of HS altered the GA/ABA ratio, which is consistent with our observation of increased germination speed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), and faster seedling establishment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Interestingly, 48 h of HS also displayed an altered ratio of GA/ABA, however, only in 24 h HS seeds an elevated starch concentration was observed. Inhibition of germination and maturation has been linked to an increase in up to two fold of the GA/ABA ratio in maize and Arabidopsis seeds (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Koornneef et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, ABA content in seeds was positively correlated with variations in dormancy in seeds with a similar degree of ABA sensitivity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hilhorst, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>). Based on our results, we cannot clearly separate the impact of altered GA/ABA ratio and increased starch content on improved germination and seedling vigor of 24 h HS seeds.</p><p>During grain filling, ABA levels have been shown to influence the deposition of different seed compounds (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Koornneef et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hilhorst, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). We observed an overall decrease in starch content when seeds were exposed to variable periods of moderate and severe HS during early seed development. However, 24 h of moderate HS increased total starch content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), providing more resources for seed germination (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref>) and seedling establishment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The duration of HS during seed development could have a big impact on subsequent generations. Studies focused on how HS affects the seed filling period suggest that the timing of stressful conditions might be decisive, since it could impact the biosynthesis of specific storage compounds (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that HS on early developmental stages has a negative impact on storage compound accumulation. In wheat, it was demonstrated that drought stress during early seed development affects gene expression of storage compounds (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Begcy and Walia, 2015</xref>), suggesting that different stresses during early seed development might modify the downstream expression of genes associated with the synthesis of seed storage compounds.</p><p>Predicted increase of global temperature in the future is expected to negatively impact food production in many regions. During reproductive development and particularly early seed development, exposure to stresses could limit plant productivity even more.
