Till date, there is little information on the pathogenic mechanisms involved in Karnal bunt. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, highly aggressive <italic>T</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> TiK isolate was cultured in the presence of host factor extracted from developing spikes of wheat variety WH-542. Modulation in protein profile of mycelial proteins and secretome from TiK cultured in the absence and presence of host factor was analyzed by 2-DE. Fifteen and twenty nine protein spots were up-regulated/differentially regulated in the proteome of mycelial and secreted proteins, respectively and identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF. Identified proteins are involved in suppression of host defense responses, lignin degradation of plant cell wall, penetration, adhesion of pathogen to host tissues, pathogen mediated reactive oxygen species generation, hydrolytic enzymes, detoxification of host generated reactive oxygen species. Further, integration of proteomic and genomic analysis has led to candidate pathogenicity/virulence factors identification. They were functionally annotated by sequence as well as structure based analysis. In this study, complementation of proteomics and genomics approaches resulted in novel pathogenicity/virulence factor(s) identification in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>indica</italic>.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) is the most widely cultivated crop, covering 17% of the world&#x02019;s acreage <bold>(</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.idrc.ca/en/article/facts-figures-food-and-biodiversity">https://www.idrc.ca/en/article/facts-figures-food-and-biodiversity</ext-link><bold>)</bold>. Wheat is a rich source of carbohydrate, dietary fibers, minerals, proteins and vitamins and provides more calories to the world&#x02019;s diet than other crops. Wheat productivity has not kept pace with the increased world population.

Being staple food for 40% of the world&#x02019;s population, there is always a high demand for wheat which drives the growth in wheat cultivation.</p><p id="Par3">Wheat production is severely affected by various fungal diseases such as rusts, molds, smuts, blights, bunts and mildews. Among them, Karnal bunt (KB) disease incited by hemibiotrophic smut fungus <italic>Tilletia indica</italic> partially damages and replaces the kernels with black powdery mass of fetid spores. Since only a portion of the kernel is damaged, the disease is often known as partial bunt. It was named after Karnal city, India from where it was first recorded in 1931. The disease has also been reported from several countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Nepal, Arizona, USA, Iran, Afganistan, Iraq, Brazil and Pakistan <bold>(</bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/36168">https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/36168</ext-link><bold>)</bold>. KB not only reduces the crop yield but also the seed quality and germination potential. Wheat seeds with more than 1% infected seeds becomes inedible and wheat lots having more than 3% bunted grains should not be used for consumption by humans, This downgrades a good quality wheat seeds to animal feed, causing huge financial losses to the wheat producers. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> has been considered as quarantined pest in 70 countries and thus hindered the free movement of wheat consignments to countries that are currently free from KB pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Plant pathogenic fungi utilizes various pathogenicity/virulence factors for infecting their hosts. They are usually classified as toxins effective against host defences, parts of signal transduction machinery, transporters for defending the pathogen against host defence system, penetration effectors and enzymes involved in degradation of host defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Recent studies by ten Have <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> suggested the importance of aspartyl proteases as key pathogenicity factors in fungus <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic>.

To date, information on the pathogenicity/virulence factors induced in pathogen <italic>T</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> by its host wheat is unavailable. In the present study, the modulation in the protein profile of mycelia proteins and secretome from TiK isolate cultured in the absence and presence of host factor was analyzed using mass spectrometry based proteomics approach. The identified proteins are involved in suppression of host defense responses (salicylate hydroxylate, isochorismatase hydrolase), lignin degradation of plant cell wall (1, 4- benzoquinone reductase), penetration (isocitrate lyase), adhesion of pathogen to host tissues (pyruvate dehydrogenase), pathogen mediated reactive oxygen species generation (Galactose oxidases), hydrolytic enzymes (Glycoside hydrolase family 30, Aspartate proteases), detoxification of host generated reactive oxygen species (peroxiredoxins). Complementation of proteomic and genomic analysis resulted in identification of several candidate pathogenicity/virulence factors in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> induced in the presence of host wheat. The identified pathogenicity/virulence factors may be utilized as biomarkers for KB resistant wheat variety screening, development of fungicides and sensitive diagnostics for rapid on- site KB detection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
