    "Karnal bunt disease of wheat is incited by quarantine fungal pathogen T. indica. Till date, there is little information on the pathogenic mechanisms involved in Karnal bunt. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, highly aggressive T. indica TiK isolate was cultured in the presence of host factor extracted from developing spikes of wheat variety WH-542. Modulation in protein profile of mycelial proteins and secretome from TiK cultured in the absence and presence of host factor was analyzed by 2-DE. Fifteen and twenty nine protein spots were up-regulated/differentially regulated in the proteome of mycelial and secreted proteins, respectively and identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF. Identified proteins are involved in suppression of host defense responses, lignin degradation of plant cell wall, penetration, adhesion of pathogen to host tissues, pathogen mediated reactive oxygen species generation, hydrolytic enzymes, detoxification of host generated reactive oxygen species. Further, integration of proteomic and genomic analysis has led to candidate pathogenicity/virulence factors identification. They were functionally annotated by sequence as well as structure based analysis. In this study, complementation of proteomics and genomics approaches resulted in novel pathogenicity/virulence factor(s) identification in T. indica."
