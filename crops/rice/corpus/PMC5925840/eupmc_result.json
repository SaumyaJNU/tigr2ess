    "BACKGROUND:Intron retention (IR), the most prevalent alternative splicing form in plants, plays a critical role in gene expression during plant development and stress response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IR regulation remain largely unknown. RESULTS:Knockdown of SDG725, a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36)-specific methyltransferase in rice, leads to alterations of IR in more than 4700 genes. Surprisingly, IR events are globally increased at the 5' region but decreased at the 3' region of the gene body in the SDG725-knockdown mutant. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses reveal that SDG725 depletion results in a genome-wide increase of the H3K36 mono-methylation (H3K36me1) but, unexpectedly, promoter-proximal shifts of H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (H3K36me2 and H3K36me3). Consistent with the results in animals, the levels of H3K36me1/me2/me3 in rice positively correlate with gene expression levels, whereas shifts of H3K36me2/me3 coincide with position-specific alterations of IR. We find that either H3K36me2 or H3K36me3 alone contributes to the positional change of IR caused by SDG725 knockdown, although IR shift is more significant when both H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 modifications are simultaneously shifted. CONCLUSIONS:Our results revealed that SDG725 modulates IR in a position-specific manner, indicating that H3K36 methylation plays a role in RNA splicing, probably by marking the retained introns in plants."
