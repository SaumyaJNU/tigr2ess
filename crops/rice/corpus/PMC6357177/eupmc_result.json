    "Two previously unreported citrinin dimer derivatives, penicitol D (1) and 1-epi-citrinin H1 (2), were isolated from the culture of a deep sea-derived fungus Penicillium citrinum NLG-S01-P1, together with 11 biogenetic related compounds (3⁻13). A plausible biogenetic pathway for compounds 2⁻4 was proposed. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were established through analysis of extensive spectroscopic data and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) ECD calculations. Compounds 1 and 2 showed antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Compounds 5 and 10 displayed relatively stronger activities than the other compounds against Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio campbellii. Compound 1 showed the most potent cytotoxic activity towards the HeLa cell."
