    "This paper intends to evaluate the influence of content of rice husk fiber and cementitious materials on mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of thermal insulation wallboards. Thermal insulation wallboard contained different mass of rice husk fiber was prepared when the weight of cement, fly ash, cellulose ether, naphthalene superplasticizer, and recycled concrete aggregates was equal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows the internal structure of the insulation wallboards is very dense. Compared to thermal conductivity of blank group (0.9600 W/m·°C), B2 (0.1997 W/m·°C) and C2 (0.1810 W/m·°C) measured by the DRCD-3030 intelligent thermal conductivity tester can meet certain engineering requirements. Average compressive strength, flexural strength, and thermal conductivity of wallboards decreases with content of rice husk fiber increasing when other materials mass are the same. Under the same conditions of curing time and rice husk content, average compressive and flexural strength increase with the increase of the amount of cementitious material."
