    "The Rice Yield-related Database (RicyerDB) was created to complement with related research of influence rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield in multiple traits by manually curating the related databases and literature, and genomics and proteomics information that could be useful for comprehensive understanding of the rice biology. RicyerDB provides a more valuable resource in which to efficiently investigate, browse and analyze yield-related genes. The whole data set can be easily queried and downloaded through the webpage. In addition, RicyerDB also constructed a protein-protein interaction network with biological analysis. The combined rice database opens a new path to facilitate researchers achieving information on rice gene in terms of their effects on traits important for rice breeding. The web server is freely available at: http://server.malab.cn/Ricyer/index.html."
