    "Background:Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) is a subtropical tree bearing fruit that ripens during late spring and early summer, which is the off-season for fruit production. The specific flowering habit of loquat, which starts in fall and ends in winter, has attracted an increasing number of researchers who believe that it may represent an ideal model for studying flowering shift adaptations to climate change in Rosaceae. These studies require an understanding of gene expression patterns within the fruit and other tissues of this plant. Although ACTINs (ACTs) have previously been used as reference genes (RGs) for gene expression studies in loquats, a comprehensive analysis of whether these RGs are optimal for normalizing RT-qPCR data has not been performed. Results:In this study, 11 candidate RGs (RIBOSOMAL-LIKE PROTEIN4 (RPL4), RIBOSOMAL-LIKE PROTEIN18 (RPL18), Histone H3.3 (HIS3), Alpha-tubulin-3 (TUA3), S-Adenosyl Methionine Decarboxylase (SAMDC), TIP41-like Family Protein (TIP41), (UDP)-glucose Pyrophosphorylase (UGPase), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Plasma Intrinsic Protein 2 (PIP2) and ACTIN(ACT)) were assessed to determine their expression stability in 23 samples from different tissues or organs of loquat. Integrated expression stability evaluations using five computational statistical methods (GeNorm, NormFinder, Î”Ct, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) suggested that a RG set, including RPL4, RPL18, HIS3 and TUA3, was the most stable one across all of the tested loquat samples. The expression pattern of EjCDKB1;2 in the tested loquat tissues normalized to the selected RG set demonstrated its reliability. Conclusions:This study reveals the reliable RGs for accurate normalization of gene expression in loquat. In addition, our findings demonstrate an efficient system for identifying the most effective RGs for different organs, which may be applied to related rosaceous crops."
