    "Eight staple rice cultivars consumed in Kyrgyzstan were evaluated for physical properties in this study. The dimensions of investigated grains correspond to 5.29-6.99 mm for length, 2.52-3.10 mm for width, and 1.88-2.13 for thickness. Equivalent diameter was in range of 3.14 - 3.47 mm, surface area took 25.35-31.90 mm². The sphericity analysis values varied from 0.480 to 0.559, aspect ratio from 0.39 to 0.55, volume of the grain was measured in range from 16.25 to 22.02 mm3, bulk density values were 0.77-0.87 g/cm3, and solid density from 1.17 to 1.41 g/cm3. The porosity of grain was equal to 28.27-39.83%, thousand kernel weight correspond to 19.67 to 27.15 g, rupture force of grain was measured in range of 63.47-155.50 N, color characteristic varied in parameters L*, a* and b*, 37.58-72.19, -0.22-10.17, and 9.65-21.12, respectively. Optimum cooking time ranged from 19.33 to 33.00 min. The water uptake ratios for 30 min of soaking were 1.21-1.28, 1.18-1.45, and 1.14-1.57 for 30, 45, and 60°C, respectively. While the water uptake ratios for 60 min of soaking were 1.22-1.42, 1.19-1.54, and 1.25-1.75 for 30, 45, and 60°C, respectively. Optimal cooking time showed that imported varieties needed lower interval for full grain cooking compared to the local Kyrgyz varieties. It was found that Kyrgyz rice varieties staying more firm after cooking as compared to imported varieties and therefore more suitable for the local traditional dish such as plov."
