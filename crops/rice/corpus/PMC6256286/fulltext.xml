Proteomics was used to quantify the abundance of <italic>O. australiensis</italic> Rca (Rca-<italic>Oa</italic>) in the resulting plants. Plants were grown to maturity in growth rooms and from early tillering until immediately prior to anthesis, they were exposed to daytime maximum temperatures of 28, 40, and 45&#x000b0;C and constant night temperatures of 22&#x000b0;C. Non-destructive measurements of leaf elongation and photosynthesis were used to compare the <italic>null</italic> segregant with a transfected line in which 19% of its total Rca content was the recombinant <italic>O. australiensis</italic> Rca (T-<italic>Oa</italic>-19). Height, fresh mass, panicle number, seed set, and seed number were measured at final harvest. Traits at maturity after heat stress at 45&#x000b0;C correlated strongly with recombinant protein abundance. Seed number was far the most responsive trait to an increase in Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> abundance, improving by up to 150%. Leaf elongation rates (<italic>LER</italic>) and tiller number were significantly greater in the transformed plants in the first two weeks of exposure to 45&#x000b0;C but tiller numbers later became equal in the two genotypes. Gas exchange measurements showed that T-<italic>Oa</italic>-19 had faster light induction of photosynthesis but not significantly higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates, indicating that the carbon gain that resulted in large yield improvement after growth at 45&#x000b0;C was not strongly correlated with an instantaneous measurement of steady-state photosynthesis. When plants were grown at 40&#x000b0;C daytime maximum, there was no improvement in the final biomass, panicle or seed number when compared with 28&#x000b0;C, indicating that the threshold for heat damage and beneficial effects of the thermostable Rca recombinant protein was between 40 and 45&#x000b0;C, which corresponded to leaf temperatures in the range 38&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C. The results suggest that the thermotolerant form of Rca from <italic>O. australiensis</italic> was sufficient to enhance carbohydrate accumulation and storage by rice over the life of the plant, dramatically improving yields after exposure to heat throughout the vegetative phase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rubisco activase (Rca)</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice)</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza australiensis</italic></kwd><kwd>yield</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>wild relatives</kwd><kwd>thermotolerance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Commission<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000780</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">706115</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a growing expectation that improving photosynthetic potential in crops is required to boost crop productivity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth and Ort, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Parry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hermida-Carrera et al., 2016</xref>). In all plants, photosynthesis is inhibited as leaf canopies are heated beyond an optimum temperature, as determined by the climatic regime in which each species evolved (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Berry and Bjorkman, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yamori et al., 2013</xref>). The rise in mean temperatures and in the duration and frequency of heatwaves in many of the world&#x02019;s arable cropping regions is therefore already having a negative impact on crop yield (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hartmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The introgression of genes that code for abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms into commercial crop plants offers the genuine prospect of sustained yields in adverse growing conditions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Atwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mickelbart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Palmgren et al., 2015</xref>). In pursuit of this aim, we have previously discovered that wild relatives of domesticated rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) are more heat tolerant and determined some of the physiological and biochemical factors that confer this tolerance (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). While many genes whose products are vulnerable to instability at high temperatures might have evolved novel isoforms in these wild species under the forces of natural selection, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al. (2010)</xref> identified Rubisco activase (<italic>RCA</italic>) as a prime candidate for further investigation because heat enhanced its expression in an Australian wild species of rice (<italic>Oryza meridionalis</italic>). Moreover, there is evidence that the Rca protein, its post-translational regulation or aspects of its catalytic behaviour are intolerant to temperatures much above 30&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Salvucci and Crafts-Brandner, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmo-Silva and Salvucci, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Busch and Sage, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In biochemical studies (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al., 2016</xref>), we previously demonstrated that the form of Rca in the wild species <italic>Oryza australiensis</italic> has 19 amino acid changes in comparison to Rca from <italic>O. sativa</italic>. Furthermore, we showed that this altered protein catalysed the activation of Rubisco at temperatures up to 42&#x000b0;C while the efficacy of Rca from <italic>O. sativa</italic> became defective at temperatures exceeding 36&#x000b0;C. The susceptibility of rice Rca to temperatures above 35&#x000b0;C is supported by another recent study on Rca temperature sensitivity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Shivhare and Mueller-Cajar, 2017</xref>). However, these observations and others on variant forms of Rca in plants (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Feller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmo-Silva and Salvucci, 2011</xref>) are based on <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses while the conditions under which Rca functions <italic>in vivo</italic> are poorly understood and complicated by the fact that Rca thermostability is highly dependent on concentration-dependent self-association, the presence of stabilising co-factors such as nucleotides, and ions such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Keown and Pearce, 2014</xref>). The role played by chaperones such as Cpn60 in the interaction between Rca and Rubisco is another unresolved factor (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Salvucci, 2007</xref>), with many heat-shock proteins and associated factors expressed in heat-treated plants, and their roles as chaperones and thus stabilisers of proteins such as Rca cannot be discounted (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Katiyar-Agarwal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Murakami et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Experiments were therefore designed to report on the phenotype of rice that had been transformed with various constructs designed for overexpression of the <italic>O. australiensis RCA</italic> gene and exposed to long-term heat through the vegetative phase of growth. A previous report in the model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> demonstrated that improvements to <italic>in planta</italic> Rca thermostability through genetic engineering can boost photosynthesis, growth, and development when heat stress is imposed (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kurek et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, overexpressing a maize <italic>RCA</italic> in rice led to increased photosynthetic performance for rice grown at higher temperatures, particularly under non-steady-state conditions (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yamori et al., 2012</xref>). However, to our knowledge this is the first report of a transgenic crop incorporating a single <italic>RCA</italic> gene to test growth and developmental heat tolerance. Our hypothesis was that small <italic>instantaneous</italic> improvements in photosynthetic carbon gain in the transgenic plants exposed to heat will cumulatively result in major impacts on yield. Specifically, we propose that plants that fix CO<sub>2</sub> more efficiently during successive weeks of vegetative growth during high temperature can subsequently re-mobilise these carbohydrates into grain. The impact of a variant form of <italic>RCA</italic> throughout the lifecycle is not predictable <italic>a priori</italic> and thus long-term observations of these aspects of plant performance in transgenic plants are essential. In this study, the efficiency with which the <italic>RCA</italic> transgene was expressed was estimated using multiple reaction monitoring high-resolution proteomics (MRM-HR), thus enabling correlations between the phenotypic responses and the level of <italic>O. australiensis</italic> recombinant Rca abundance and total Rca protein abundance.</p><p>By observing plants growing at optimal and supra-optimal temperatures through various stages of phenology, these experiments provide the most credible evidence for the role of Rca in heat tolerance and the potential for improvements through the use of variants of the <italic>RCA</italic> gene from wild species. Plants were grown at day temperatures of 28, 40, and 45&#x000b0;C but constant night temperatures of 22&#x000b0;C, with the higher day temperatures imposed after a four-hour ramping period. Early non-destructive observations of <italic>LER</italic> and tillering determined the effects of the transgene during exponential growth. Gas exchange was used to demonstrate the effect of the transgene on photosynthesis. Plants were then returned to optimal temperatures before flowering in order to prevent heat damage during meiosis. Carbon mobilisation and grain filling therefore occurred under optimal temperatures, after which numbers of panicles and tillers as well as seeds set and harvested are reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material</title><p><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> cv. BHRI-43 was the parent line in all experiments. Transgenic rice (T3 homozygous Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> single-copy lines as described below) and segregating lines not containing the transgenes (referred to as the <italic>null</italic> segregant) were sown in 66-well sowing trays after seeds had been soaked in water for 1.5 days. The seedlings were transplanted to 9 cm diameter pots after 20 days and 14 individuals of similar size/height (visual score) were chosen for experiments. Plants were grown in a growth medium as outlined in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S1</xref>. Plants were initially grown at 28/22&#x000b0;C in the light/dark with a 12-h photoperiod [ca. 300 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)]. Thirty days after sowing, plants were either kept at 28&#x000b0;C during daytime or temperatures were ramped up over a 4-h period in the mornings to 40 or 45&#x000b0;C, held at this temperature for 6-h and then returned to the dark at 22&#x000b0;C after a 4-h ramping down. Relative humidity was kept between 60 and 70% throughout the experiments. The cycle was continued until the onset of anthesis, corresponding to a heating treatment of 99 days. A random block design was used, with the genotypes randomly assigned to positions within 10 specially separated blocks across the growth rooms to account for any confounding effects associated with growing position. Wild type plants were also grown across the borders of the growing bench to remove any influence of edge effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Transformation</title><p>The coding sequences for the short Rca-&#x003b2; (NCBI Accession KR871003) and long Rca-&#x003b1; (NCBI Accession KR871002) isoform from <italic>O. australiensis</italic> were obtained by chemical DNA synthesis and were adapted to rice codon usage. The following three genes were inserted into a cloning vector: (1) the complete sequence of Rca-&#x003b2;; (2) a 5-amino acid truncated sequence of Rca-&#x003b2; with the last five codons deleted (i.e., AAPSS deleted from the C-terminus of the encoded protein); and (3) the complete sequence of Rca-&#x003b1;. In all three vectors, the gene was driven by the promoter of Rca-&#x003b1; from <italic>Oryza meridionalis</italic>. The intermediate cloning vectors were constructed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and the final vector transferred to the acceptor <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain via heat-shock. All transformation events for the three vectors were generated using the same procedure. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer of the T-DNA vectors resulted in transfer of the DNA fragment between the T-DNA border repeats to the plant genome. As target tissue for transfection, immature embryo or embryo-derived callus were cut into small pieces, essentially using the technique described in <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;halluin and G&#x000f6;bel (1991)</xref>. Agrobacterium was co-cultivated with the rice tissues for some days, and then removed by suitable antibiotics. Transformed rice cells were selected by addition of glufosinate ammonium (with phosphinothricin 5 mg/L) to the rice tissue culture medium. Calli growing on media with glufosinate ammonium were transferred to regeneration medium. When plantlets with roots and shoots had developed, they were transferred to soil, and placed in a greenhouse. Initially 15 independent single copy transformation lines were created for each vector (i.e., 15 transformation lines for the above-described vectors 1, 2, and 3). A further gene expression analysis of seven lines for each of the three vectors was undertaken (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) and a single line for each vector selected for the experiments as presented. A segregating line (which also underwent the transformation process) was used as the control <italic>null</italic> segregant. No difference in phenotype and phenology was observed among different <italic>null</italic> segregants when grown under standard conditions (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Extraction and Quantification of Recombinant Protein</title><p>Protein from leaf tissue was extracted from at least three biological replicates of each transformation line. Mature leaf blades were harvested and stored at -80&#x000b0;C then ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Fifty mg of powdered leaf growing zone was immediately suspended in 1.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone and 0.07% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol then incubated at -20&#x000b0;C for 1 h. After centrifugation for 30 min at 16000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>, the resulting pellet was washed with 1.5 mL of 100% acetone followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 16000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>. The acetone washing step was repeated three times for the complete removal of pigments, lipids and other lipophilic molecules. The colourless resulting pellet was lyophilised in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended with 400 &#x003bc;L of 2% SDS in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.8). Each sample was reduced with dithiothreitol (10 mM DTT), alkylated with iodoacetamide (20 mM IAA) and then digested with 0.4 &#x003bc;g trypsin (1:25) for 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The digested sample was dried and resuspended in 50 &#x003bc;L of loading buffer (2% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid).</p></sec><sec><title>Targeting Species-Specific Peptides</title><p>An initial independent data acquisition (IDA) dataset was acquired at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (APAF), allowing the identification of target peptides for later scheduled high resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM-HR) analysis. Various target peptides based on translated sequences were used to identify the species-specific Rca isoforms within each transgenic and <italic>null</italic> genotype extract. The most reliable peptides to discriminate the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; Rca isoforms were SFQCELVFAK for <italic>O. sativa</italic> and SFQCELVFSK for <italic>O. australiensis</italic>. 10 &#x003bc;L (2 &#x003bc;g) of each digested sample was transferred to HPLC vials for MRM-HR analysis. The product ion variation window was +/-0.05 Da for peak integration. All samples were freshly prepared for each run.</p><p>For data acquisition, the sample was injected onto a peptide trap (Bruker peptide Captrap) for pre-concentration and desalted with 0.1% formic acid, 2% ACN, at 5 &#x003bc;L min<sup>-1</sup> for 5 min. The peptide trap was then switched into line with the analytical column (Halo C<sub>18</sub>, 100 mm &#x000d7; 150 &#x003bc;m, 160&#x000c5;, 2.7 &#x003bc;m). Peptides were eluted from the column using a linear solvent gradient from mobile phase A: mobile phase B (98:2) to mobile phase A: mobile phase B (65:35) where mobile phase A is 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B is 99.9% ACN/0.1% formic acid at 600 nL min<sup>-1</sup> over a 95 min period. After peptide elution, the column was cleaned with 95% buffer B for 10 min and then equilibrated with 98% buffer A for 15 min before the next sample injection. The reverse phase nanoLC eluent was subjected to positive ion nanoflow electrospray analysis. The product ion scans were 100 ms in the mass range m/z 100&#x02013;1500 with the total cycle time of 1.4 s. Data were processed by MultiQuant (AB Sciex, v 2.1.1) software.</p><p>Four <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labelled SIL (stable isotope labelled) peptides were used in a subsequent experiment to quantify the RCA isoforms in transgenic plants. The peptide sequences used are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S2</xref>, with asterisks denoting the position of the labelled amino acids as follows: K<sup>&#x02217;</sup> = Lys U-<sup>13</sup>C6; U-<sup>15</sup>N2 and F<sup>&#x02217;</sup> = Phe U-<sup>13</sup>C9; U-<sup>15</sup>N. Each vial of SIL peptides (1 nmol/vial) was suspended in 500 &#x003bc;L of MQ water. The resuspended four SIL peptides were then mixed, resulting a mixed SIL peptide stock solution with a concentration of 0.5 pmol &#x003bc;L<sup>-1</sup> for each SIL peptide. 10 &#x003bc;L of this mixed SIL peptide solution was added into each 10 &#x003bc;g rice protein sample. The concentration factor for SIL peptides was 500 pmol mg<sup>-1</sup>. Further mass spectrometry was performed on the TripleTOF 6600 (Sciex) and data analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Vegetative and Reproductive Measurements</title><p>After the first plant started to flower, daytime temperature was reduced to 28&#x02013;29&#x000b0;C (control conditions) in order to avoid pollen sterility. All plants were harvested at full maturity (at the completion of seed filling) and number of tillers, panicles and seeds as well as seed set (an estimated % of panicle filled with seed), above-ground fresh and dry mass (g) per plant were measured. Tiller numbers were also recorded 2 and 6 weeks after the heating as indicated in the text. Dry mass was taken after drying all above ground biomass for 1 week at 30&#x000b0;C until completely dry. The <italic>LER</italic> were measured in the second week after heating began, using a linear variable displacement transducer, essentially as described by <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al.

All measurements were made at a CO<sub>2</sub> reference value of 400 &#x003bc;mol mol<sup>-1</sup> air and a cuvette air temperature set to the prevailing growth temperature. <italic>A</italic><sub>n</sub> measurements were taken during the 45&#x000b0;C heat exposure 15&#x02013;19 days after the beginning of heat exposure, 45&#x02013;49 days after sowing, and all measurements were done between 12- and 16-h into the daily cycle, during the 45&#x000b0;C daily maximum. Plants were initially covered in plastic non-transparent boxes for 30 min to reduce PAR to less than 30 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The IRGA chamber was then attached to healthy fully expanded leaves with PAR turned off and automatic logging every 10 s.

Plotting Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> abundance against four distinct traits of growth and development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we established that the transgene was responsible for various degrees of improvement in phenotype in plants grown under hot conditions. The two measures that best reflect vegetative growth after continuous 45&#x000b0;C days &#x02013; plant height and dry mass (<italic>DM</italic>) &#x02013; increased by up to 25% by maturity. Panicle number, as a measure of development, increased by about 40% because of the transgene, while the ultimate reproductive measure of plant performance in rice (seed number) was improved by more than 150% after the preceding 99 days of 45&#x000b0;C maxima. Positive correlations were highly significant in all cases, although <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of the regression of the four means was modest, with values of 0.11, 0.14, 0.18, and 0.21 for plant height, <italic>DM</italic>, panicle number, and seed number, respectively (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Effects of altered Rca activity on non-steady state photosynthesis have been demonstrated (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yamori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Carmo-Silva and Salvucci, 2013</xref>) but sustained faster rates of carbon assimilation seem to be more subtle and leave the question of long-term effects on plant growth in hot environments unresolved. In fact, many studies show limited direct evidence of leaf-level, steady-state photosynthesis impacting on yield (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zelitch, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Reynolds et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Driever et al., 2014</xref>). In this light, a heat-tolerant form of Rca from <italic>O. australiensis</italic> was expressed in <italic>O. sativa</italic> and plant phenotype was tested over the life of the plant with a particular view to assessing yield. We demonstrate a dramatic improvement in growth and yield of heat stressed rice associated with subtle improvements in photosynthetic potential.</p><p>When expression of the Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> transgene was assessed by proteomics to quantify the abundance of the foreign Rca isoform in three transformed lines, it revealed a spectrum of Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> expression levels (9&#x02013;19% of the Rca pool) and thus afforded the opportunity to calibrate phenotypic features against Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> expression. Of importance, the total (endogenous + recombinant) Rca pool did not change significantly among the transformed lines, so differences between lines could be attributed to the abundance of the recombinant <italic>O. australiensis</italic> Rca protein and not total Rca protein abundance. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis has demonstrated that <italic>O. australiensis</italic> &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms have the same thermostability profile (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al., 2016</xref>) and the 5-amino acid truncated version did not differ from wild type Rca (unpublished results). We therefore expected no difference to exist in the thermostability characteristics of the three gene products but rather differences to occur depending on the level of overexpression. In the overexpression lines and at a 45&#x000b0;C daytime maximum, seed yield was the trait that was most dramatically affected, with up to a 150% (i.e., 2.5-fold) increase in numbers of seeds at maturity when 19% of the total Rca pool was present as the <italic>O. australiensis</italic> isoform (i.e., the T-<italic>Oa</italic>-19 line with the &#x003b2; isoform 5-amino acid truncated version). Other traits were affected less strongly, indicating that the phenotypic impact of a thermotolerant Rca after sustained heat treatment was not proportionate across all traits. For example, panicle number, which contributed directly to seed production, was also enhanced by the transgene, while traits related to biomass such as height and above ground dry mass were much less affected, and tiller numbers at maturity were not affected at all. These observations presumably reflect the manner in which additional carbon assimilation enhances the performance of this particular rice genotype; source-sink relations in cereals would predict a shifting allocation of newly acquired carbohydrates to growth, storage, respiration, and reproductive sinks (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Foulkes et al., 2011</xref>). A parallel experiment in which photosynthetic carbon gain of <italic>O. sativa</italic> plants would be stimulated by CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment at these very high temperatures would be instructive if it replicated this pattern of partitioning. Of interest, panicle numbers increased on a plot area in rice exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment in FACE experiments (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2009</xref>) due to increased tiller number, not the productivity of individual tillers as we observed here, suggesting that temperature treatments influence carbon partitioning differently from CO<sub>2</sub> enhancement.</p><p>When comparing the most strongly overexpressing line, Rca-<italic>Oa</italic>-19, with the <italic>null</italic> segregant during early phases of development soon after 45&#x000b0;C days were imposed, the transgene significantly enhanced leaf elongation and increased tiller number, indicating partitioning of additional photoassimilates to growth (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These stimulatory effects were in the order of 10% but were apparent in the first two weeks of heat treatment and therefore subject to amplification in the weeks of exponential growth that would follow. While <italic>LER</italic> is a non-destructive surrogate for growth (<italic>cf</italic>. biomass), these instantaneous measurements show both the slump in growth as the duration of heat continues through the day and the consistent and significant gains that are seen in leaves of the most strongly expressing Rca-<italic>Oa</italic>-19 line. The benefit to leaf growth was maintained at each sampling time but the impact of Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> on root growth and development remains to be investigated.</p><p>Similar to leaf elongation, light induction curves showed a small but significantly steeper rise in photosynthesis in Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> plants after illumination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) while steady-state rates of assimilation were also higher but not significantly. This small difference in induction and limited changes in steady-state photosynthesis are expected as severe knockdown of 80% or more of Rca content is needed to elicit a dramatic difference in light induction kinetics while still having limited impact on steady-state photosynthesis (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hammond et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yamori et al. (2012)</xref>, who transformed rice with a maize <italic>Rca</italic>, also showed that light induction was responsive to the transgene while steady-state photosynthesis responded only weakly. These results would suggest that the benefit of thermostable Rca manifests itself through enhanced photosynthetic performance when photosynthesis is in flux. Considering these experiments were undertaken in controlled growth rooms, one might expect the more dynamic environment of the field to elicit an even stronger response of the Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> recombinant protein.</p><p>The choice of 45&#x000b0;C as an appropriate temperature to heat stress rice with abundant water supply was evident in that the data reveal no impact of heat on growth and development traits, including yield until daily maxima were raised to 45&#x000b0;C. It should be noted that leaf temperatures were 2&#x02013;3&#x000b0;C lower than air temperature, suggesting that the threshold leaf temperature for heat-induced damage to photosynthetic biochemistry was between 38 and 42&#x000b0;C. This temperature threshold accords with our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, where temperatures greater than 36&#x000b0;C severely impaired function of Rca-<italic>Os</italic> while having little effect on Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Scafaro et al., 2016</xref>). In this temperature range, the advantageous effect of Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> expression at levels below 20% of the total Rca complement was sufficient to enhance vegetative growth, final biomass, panicle development and, most particularly, seed number. Because the grain developed optimally in all plants at 30&#x000b0;C, variation in yield is reflected in seed number (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Makino, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e1;nchez et al., 2014</xref>). As well as higher seed numbers, there is also evidence that seed set was positively affected by Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> expression, supporting the case that the transgene enhanced potential yield as reflected by seed set (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Makino, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The effect of the wild rice Rca recombinant protein on the phenotype of heat-treated transgenic rice plants is complex. Part of the complexity arose through the requirement that plants had to be exposed to sufficient heat (45&#x000b0;C) in order to elicit a metabolic penalty during vegetative development but the heat treatment had to be discontinued once the maturity phase of reproductive development commenced in order not to affect photoassimilate mobilisation to the grain. Such a regime tested the cumulative impact of heat on accrual of photoassimilates without confounding the effect by sterilising the gametes, which is a well-known effect of heat on rice (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2006</xref>). Despite removing the heat treatment at the onset of anthesis, we cannot exclude the possibility that heat affected reproductive processes prior to this point, as drought stress has been shown to increase pre-anthesis spikelet abortion in rice (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). It is argued that increased photoassimilate resource accumulation positively influences the pre-anthesis meiosis success with exposure to stresses including heat (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barnab&#x000e1;s et al., 2008</xref>), so arguably, overexpression of the thermostable Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> could have conferred a benefit to reproductive development in the transgenic lines upon heat treatment during this particular period. While we prevented to a large extent the impact of gamete sterility on potential yield by discontinuing the heat stress at anthesis, the plants in this study allocated marginally more carbon to growth in the early stages of development and this cumulative effect was reflected in final biomass, which was strongly correlated with panicle number. However, tiller numbers in later development, and steady-state photosynthetic rates, did not respond to the expression of the transgene, indicating that the carbon gain in Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> overexpressing plants after a long heat treatment did not translate into either exaggerated development (excessive tillering) and was not perceptible through faster photosynthesis at one point in time; carbon mass-balance budgets at various stages of development would be required to discover how the additional carbon was accrued (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gregory and Atwell, 1991</xref>), as it is difficult to link instantaneous gas-exchange measurements of a single tissue type and at any point in time to final biomass and yield (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Parry et al., 2011</xref>). <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zelitch (1982)</xref> explored this &#x0201c;paradox&#x0201d; thoroughly and concluded from many prior studies that an alignment of rates of instantaneous CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and long-term biomass accumulation is exceedingly rare in studies of annual crop species. It seems in this case that marginally improved rates of steady-state net photosynthesis as well as induction of photosynthesis to perturbations such as light was a contributor to the additional carbon that was gained as a result of Rca-<italic>Oa</italic> expression. We postulate this carbon was stored in stems in the late vegetative stage, as would be predicted from classical studies of cereal development (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bell and Incoll, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Blum et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Morita and Nakano, 2011</xref>). The mobilisation of these stored carbohydrates (principally starch in rice) prior to and after flowering would then account for the very substantial gain in yield that the <italic>O. australiensis</italic> Rca confers on rice plants grown through most of their vegetative development in 45&#x000b0;C days.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AG, JVR, BA, and AS conceptualised the experiments.
