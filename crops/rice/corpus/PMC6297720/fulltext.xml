In our previous study, a putative <italic>TPX</italic> was identified using a proteomics analysis of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. <italic>japonica</italic>, <italic>OsTPX</italic>) seedlings exposed to oxidative stress. This <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene is structurally similar to the <italic>Synechococcus elongatus TPX</italic> gene in the highly conserved redox-active disulfide bridge (Cys114, Cys236) and other highly conserved regions. In the present study, the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene was cloned into rice plants and <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 strain to study hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) stress responses. The <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression was confirmed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression increased growth under oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde level. Additionally, the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 (OT) strain exhibited a reduced loss of chlorophyll and enhanced photosynthesis efficiency under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress, thereby increasing biomass yields twofold compared with that of the control wild type (WT) strain. Furthermore, redox balance, ion homeostasis, molecular chaperone, and photosynthetic systems showed upregulation of some genes in the OT strain than in the WT strain by RNA-Seq analysis. Thus, <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression enhances oxidative stress tolerance by increasing cell defense regulatory networks through the cellular redox homeostasis in the rice plants and <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>defense system</kwd><kwd>hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>redox balance</kwd><kwd>thioredoxin peroxidase</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The metabolism of most aerobic organisms inevitably produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are capable of irreversibly damaging vital cell components. In response to rising levels of ROS, cells employ additional strategies to limit damage (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, signaling pathways are activated to increase the levels of detoxification and repair enzymes. Paradoxically, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), one of the most representative ROS, is associated with this cellular signaling pathway. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations increase in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses and take part in the reactive oxygen regulatory network (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Mittler et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration needs to be carefully regulated to balance its toxic and signaling activities (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Puerto et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To modulate peroxide balance, cells express this set of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-decomposing enzymes; catalase peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, and 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (thioredoxin peroxidase, <italic>TPX</italic>). <italic>TPX</italic>, a thiol-specific peroxidase, catalyzes the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and plays a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides, and by acting as a sensor for hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events. Furthermore, <italic>TPX</italic> belongs to a conserved family of antioxidant genes, the peroxiredoxin, which use thiol groups as a source of reducing equivalents to scavenge oxidant species (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chae et al., 1994</xref>). The catalytic breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by <italic>TPX</italic> gene involves the oxidation of the peroxide-reactive peroxidatic cysteine (Cys), located in the N-terminal of proteins (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Dietz et al., 2006</xref>), followed by the formation of a disulfide with the resolving Cys (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, thioredoxin (TRX) reduces the oxidized TPX back to the monomeric form. These reactions are critical in protecting cells from ROS-induced stress and minimizing their subsequent degradation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have addressed the function of <italic>TPX</italic> gene in peroxide detoxification and redox regulation under stress conditions in various species. For instance, <italic>TPX</italic> gene protects cells against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced damage in humans (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Berggren et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>TPX</italic> not being expressed resulted in weakened phenotypes that were very sensitive to oxidative stress within <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Finkemeier et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Klughammer et al., 1998</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of heterologous <italic>TPX</italic> in transgenic plants conferred heat and methyl viologen tolerance in tall fescue (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), and promoted higher resistance against oxidative stress by enhancing antioxidant activity in transgenic tobacco (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, our previous study demonstrated that expression of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<italic>O. Sativa</italic>) <italic>TPX (OsTPX)</italic> increased oxidative stress tolerance and fermentation capacity by improving cellular redox homeostasis in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The TPX sequences of the above-mentioned species have strictly conserved residues that function as redox active sites, which are functionally similar to conserved residues. These TPX sequences possess enhanced abilities to catalyze antioxidants and antioxidant-related enzymes under ROS-induced oxidative stress. Because the function of the redox active site is functionally similar to these conserved residues, heterologous <italic>TPX</italic> could act in a role similar to the cyanobacteria <italic>TPX</italic>. However, interaction with heterologous <italic>TPX</italic> has not been extensively studied in cyanobacteria under ROS-induced oxidative stress.</p><p>In the previous study, the heterologous expression of the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene in the genetically modified <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> (<italic>S. elongatus</italic>) strain PCC 7942 was found to improve tolerance to stress, photosynthetic efficiency, and cell viability under ROS-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, in the present study we profiled gene expression to identify the mechanisms preventing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress. Our results demonstrated improved cellular redox homeostasis by enhancing oxidative stress tolerance and photosynthesis efficiency upon the introduction of the heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene, which affected the cell defense regulatory network through redox balance in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Growth Conditions</title><p>The <italic>TPX</italic> gene from <italic>O. sativa</italic> L. <italic>japonica</italic> was transfected into Ilmi cultivars of rice plants.

Library construction was conducted using a SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Clontech lab Inc., CA, United States) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. First, a strand cDNA library is synthesized using a modified N6 primer. When the SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase reaches the 5&#x02032; end of the RNA fragment, the enzyme&#x02019;s terminal transferase activity adds some additional nucleotides to the 3&#x02032; end of the cDNA. The carefully designed SMARTer Stranded Oligo base pairs with non-templated nucleotides, creating an extended template to enable the SMARTScribe RT to continue replication to the end of the oligonucleotide. The resulting full-length, single-stranded (ss) cDNA contains the complete 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA, as well as sequences that are complementary to the SMARTer Stranded Oligo. cDNA is generated to release the library from the beads, and the library is then amplified.

Interestingly, amino acid sequence alignment indicated that OsTPX shares a highly conserved active-site region; described green backgrounds (C), red backgrounds (GGLG, AW), and blue backgrounds (FTFVCPT, AW, W) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Sayed and Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pascual et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Two catalytic cysteine residues (Cys 114 and Cys 236) of TPX could have important roles in neutralizing toxic ROS, which is consistent with a previous study that found human TPX<italic>s</italic> were involved in detoxifying ROS and protected cells from oxidative stress (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Schr&#x000f6;der et al., 2000</xref>). The susceptibility to over-oxidation has been considered specific for TPX and depends on the presence of two motifs, GGLG and YF, of these proteins (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, modification of Thr66, Trp99, and Trp89 of barley HvTPX (Thr116 in FTFVCPT, Trp149 in AW, and Trp240 is W of OsTPX) involved these residues in the conformational change (dimer to oligomer) that altered protein function (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;nig et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, the previous study showed that other <italic>TPX</italic>-mutated strains exhibited decreased TPX activity, indicating that these residues are essential for the catalysis of Thr48 of poplar PtTPX (Thr111 in OsTPX), and Cys64 of barley HvTPX (Cys114 of OsTPX) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;nig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rouhier and Jacquot, 2008</xref>). The phylogenetic tree also shows the evolutionary relationship between rice and cyanobacterial <italic>TPX</italic> genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Therefore, these highly conserved regions play a key role in <italic>TPX</italic> gene function. It can be expected that the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene of rice plants functions in a cooperative role in the oxidative stress tolerance that has been observed in cyanobacteria.</p><p>To investigate whether the expression of the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene affects oxidative stress in cyanobacteria, we transformed <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 with the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene under the control of the <italic>Ptrc</italic> promoter, and confirmed its expression at the mRNA and protein levels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,C</xref>). Our results show that heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression can enhance tolerance of cyanobacteria to oxidative stress such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has been reported that the heterologous <italic>TPX</italic> gene is able to improve stress tolerance in many organisms (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jing et al., 2006</xref>). This may explain why the OT strain showed better growth than the control NS and WT strains did in the presence of abiotic stresses, including major ROS-generating agents, such as; 200 mM NaCl, a low 10&#x000b0;C temperature, 250 &#x003bc;E high-intensity light, and 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref>). Previous studies found that the <italic>TPX</italic> gene increased salt and low temperature tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jing et al., 2006</xref>); and that the loss of <italic>TPX</italic> gene function in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. resulted in significantly late grow rates compared to control wild-type strains under high light conditions (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>). In other studies, the <italic>TPX</italic> gene functioning as a chaperone indicated that it was effective in preventing protein aggregation induced by SDS stress (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses by eliminating ROS-induced oxidative stress.</p><p>As mentioned above, regulating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> balance is very important to redox homeostasis in cell peroxidation. To investigate the effects of oxidative stress such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-generated ROS, ROS levels were measured <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the WT, NS, and OT strains (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). Low ROS production in the OT strain resulted in less MDA accumulation by lipid peroxidation compared to that observed in the NS and WT strains. Therefore, the total biomass yield of the OT strain was decreased to a smaller extent upon exposure to oxidative stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). These findings are consistent with a previous observation that the <italic>TPX</italic> gene is related to oxidative stress and could eliminate cellular damage caused by ROS in cyanobacteria (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Klughammer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Stork et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pascual et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, a gene disruption study showed that the <italic>TPX</italic> gene is essential for survival under oxidative stress conditions by maintain cell stability (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, it can be speculated that heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene enhanced stress tolerance and biomass yield by preventing cell damage under the oxidative stress within <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942.</p><p>Published studies have provided evidence of the relationship between stress tolerance and photosynthetic capacity, which is affected by <italic>TPX</italic> gene overexpression in several organisms (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nikkanen and Rintamaki, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brzezowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Puerto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Guevara-Flores et al., 2017</xref>). For example, <italic>TPX</italic> gene expression conferred tolerance to long-day photoperiod and oxidative stresses by reducing the cellular ROS level in <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic> (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Pichia methanolica</italic> (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Puerto et al., 2015</xref>). We also found that the OT strain exhibited higher chlorophyll content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) and <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio under normal and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), and also showed an increased photosynthetic efficiency based on the QY, NPQ, <italic>R</italic><sub>Fd</sub>, and Pi<sub>ABS</sub> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,D</xref>). In contrast, the OT strain showed decreased DI<sub>0</sub>/RC values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), whereas the NS and WT strains exhibited considerably higher levels of energy dissipation than the OT strain under normal and 2.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conditions. This phenomenon is assumed to be related to an increase in gene expression that involved photosynthetic metabolism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S3</xref>). A high-light inducible gene, perhaps induced by <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression, could play a critical role in the adaptation of cyanobacterium through an increase in chlorophyll, and by improving the repair of the photosynthetic apparatus (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Havaux et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, genes related to the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway were increased more in the OT strain than the WT strain. Several genes such as chlorophyll synthase ChlG, magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase, and magnesium protoporphyrin IX monoethyl ester cyclase are involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway, which is known as the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway in plants (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brzezowski et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, these results indicated that heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression induced chlorophyll biosynthesis, resulting in enhanced photosynthetic capacity in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942.</p><p>Reduced TRX also reduces the oxidized TPX by ROS-induced stress. These reactions are critical in protecting cells under oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dietz, 2007</xref>). Our results, which included gene profiling of WT and OT strains under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress, showed an increase in antioxidant genes such as catalase peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase compared with control strains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). In addition, electron shuttles harboring iron&#x02013;sulfur clusters such as ferredoxin, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, and flavodoxin were increased in the OT strain. Ferredoxin is an important molecule involved in the routes of cyclic electron flow that operate under physiological and stress conditions, and is also used as a reducing equivalent by TRX and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tognetti et al., 2006</xref>). In cyanobacteria, stress situations induce the synthesis of flavodoxin (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Falk et al., 1995</xref>), an electron carrier flavoprotein that is not found in plants. The overexpression of flavodoxin in <italic>E. coli</italic> leads to an augmented tolerance toward various sources of oxidative stress (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). These electron shuttles could be expected to maintain cellular homeostasis by regulating redox balance during electron transfer. However, those antioxidant and electron carrier genes show no differential expression levels between WT and OT strains under normal conditions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S4</xref>). Interestingly, our results appear to show the level of cyanobacterial TRX (<italic>SeTPX</italic>) is more similar to the OT strain, than to the WT strain under the normal and stress conditions (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S4</xref>). This phenomenon assumed that <italic>OsTPX</italic> is not affected by <italic>SeTPX</italic> under normal and stress conditions; however, the expression of related genes were upregulated in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These results indicated that the heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene affected higher expression levels of antioxidant and electron carrier genes under the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress conditions. Consequently, the OT strain improved cell homeostasis by maintaining a redox balance when compared to the WT strain.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that the expression of the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene in rice plants and <italic>S. elongatus</italic> resulted in an improvement in stress tolerance to ROS-induced oxidative stress and enhanced photosynthetic ability. In addition, cell membrane stability and biomass yield increased in the OT strain when compared to the WT and NS strains. These effects were achieved by enhancing the balance of cellular redox homeostasis through the activity of heterologous <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression, which resulted in the expression of related genes in the redox balance, photosynthesis, ion homeostasis, and molecular chaperone. In conclusion, our results found that <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene expression of rice plants could improve the cell defense regulatory network through cellular redox homeostasis under the oxidative stress in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> PCC 7942. Therefore, future studies on the genetic and molecular functions of the <italic>OsTPX</italic> gene should focus on the interactions between plants and cyanobacteria, and their responses to various environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Y-SK, I-SK, JG, and H-SY designed the project and were involved in the writing of the manuscript.
