The insect midgut is the first major barrier limiting virus acquisition, but the mechanisms by which viruses are able to cross the cell membrane and then infect the midgut epithelial cells of the insect have not been elucidated completely. Here, we found that the outer capsid or nucleocapsid protein (NP) of three viruses can interact and colocalize with sugar transporter 6 that is highly expressed in the midgut of <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> (LsST6). In contrast, LsST6 did not interact with the NP of rice grassy stunt virus, which cannot be transmitted by the same planthopper. LsST6 not only altered the cellular location of viral proteins and then colocalized with them in the cell membrane, but also mediated the entry of rice stripe virus (RSV) particles into <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> 9 (Sf9) cells that expressed the heterologous gene <italic>LsST6</italic>. We further showed that RSV particles initially bound to the cell membrane of midgut epithelial cells where it colocalized with LsST6, and then invaded the cytoplasm. When LsST6 expression was knocked down, viral titre, acquisition percentage and transmission efficiency of the treated insect decreased significantly, but virus replication was not affected. This work thus uncovered a strategy by which LsST6 mediates viral entry into midgut epithelial cells and leads to successful transmission by the insect vector.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Sap/blood-feeding arthropods are major vectors of viruses that infect plants and vertebrates.

More than 76% of plant viruses and 40% of mammalian viruses are transmitted to the hosts by specific arthropods, mainly planthoppers, aphids, mosquitoes, and ticks [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Frequent epidemics of viral diseases in rice, wheat and vegetables are largely attributed to high populations and viral transmission efficiency of the insect vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, viruses that cause diseases in humans and animals such as dengue fever, Zika fever and Japanese encephalitis, are vectored by different species of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and are endemic in many areas of the developing world [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding the virus&#x02013;insect vector interaction and transmission mechanisms will provide important information on the epidemics of the diseases caused by plant and animal arboviruses and lead to the development of better control strategies.</p><p>Plant viruses transmitted in a persistent propagative manner and animal arboviruses follow a similar circulative route within their insect vectors. After they are acquired from plant sap or blood ingested by the insect, the virions must first cross the cell membrane of the midgut epithelial cells where the viral particles multiply [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They must then leave the midgut to disseminate to other tissues including the salivary glands, from where they can be transmitted to new hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the circulative process, arboviruses must overcome multiple barriers, including the infection and dissemination barriers of the midgut, salivary gland escape barrier, and transovarial barrier [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies showed that <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cannot be infected by eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus after ingesting viruliferous blood; however, it can transmit this virus after a virus suspension is directly injected into the insect&#x02019;s abdomen [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many plant viruses can also be transmitted by an insect that is not a natural host after the virus is injected into the hemocoel of the insect [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thus bypassing the midgut infection barrier, the first major barrier that viruses encounter and an important factor limiting virus transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To overcome the midgut barrier, viruses have evolved different strategies. The entry of rice dwarf virus into cultured cells of its vector insect and of tomato yellow leaf curl virus midgut in its vector <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, is mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) induces the formation of tubules as a vehicle for viral spread in infected epithelial cells of <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The small brown planthopper, <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is an important vector because it transmits numerous viruses that cause serious diseases of staple crops such as rice stripe virus (RSV), rice black-streaked dwarf virus, maize rough dwarf virus, northern cereal mosaic virus and barley yellow striate mosaic virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These plant viruses infect and replicate in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> and are retained by the vector insect throughout their life, as are vertebrate-infecting arboviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In most experiments when feeding on RSV-infected plants, less than 30% of the insects acquire the virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A high affinity line of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> attained an acquisition level of about 50&#x02013;60% after 4 days of acquisition feeding on RSV-infected rice plants, but four other lines reached a level of less than 10% after 8&#x02013;11 days of acquisition feeding [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, once acquired, the virus will replicate and be transmitted by vector insects at a moderate to very high rate [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although various biotic and abiotic factors affect virus acquisition by the vector insect, the epithelium, intercellular junctions, and basal lamina of the midgut present further barriers to viral entry and dissemination [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The genome of RSV consists of four single-stranded RNAs (RNA1-4), which can encode at least seven proteins including the major nucleocapsid protein (NP) encoded by the ORF at the 5&#x02032; half of the viral complementary RNA3 [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. NP is considered the key viral component for specifically interacting with the vector components and may play an important role in persistent transmission process. In previous studies, 66 proteins (including LsST6) were identified as being able to interact with the NP of RSV. Among these proteins, we chose several proteins according to molecular function and biological pathway to further investigate their function in virus transmission. CPR1 was demonstrated to stabilize the viral particles in the hemolymph [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while vitellogenin, the precursor of a yolk protein in the insect, mediates virus entry into the ovary [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the proteins involved in the ability of RSV to overcome the midgut infection barrier were not identified. Because the sugar transporter Glut1 of human acts as a receptor for human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and because a membrane protein named sugar transporter 6 of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> (LsST6) is highly expressed in the midgut, we selected LsST6 for further study. Our results showed it is an essential and key factor for RSV to cross the midgut infection barrier in vector insects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Analysis of the interaction between LsST6 and RSV NP or outer capsid protein of other viruses</title><p>The full-length <italic>LsST6</italic> (GenBank accession: MG589412), amplified from total RNA of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> using RT-PCR and 5&#x02019;RACE, contained a 1470-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a predicted 489-amino-acid (aa) protein, which had 85.6% identity with sugar transporter NlST6 in the brown planthopper (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007201.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

Here, we found that LsST6 not only strongly interacts with RSV NP <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but also alters the cellular location of NP and then colocalizes with it in the cell membrane of Sf9 cells. Moreover, LsST6 mediates the entry of RSV particles into Sf9 cells that expressed the heterologous gene <italic>LsST6</italic>. In the vector insect body, RSV initially binds to the cell surface of midgut epithelial cells where it colocalizes with LsST6 in the cell membrane. When expression of <italic>LsST6</italic> was knocked down in healthy insects injected with dsLsST6, viral titre and acquisition subsequently decreased significantly. Therefore, LsST6 plays an important role in facilitating virus invasion in both Sf9 model cells and the midgut epithelial cells of the vector insect, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic>.</p><p>Our previous bioinformatic analysis revealed that LsST6 has 85% similarity with NlST6, a facilitative glucose/fructose transporter in brown planthoppers (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>lugen</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They both belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, which are ubiquitous among organisms and enable the import and export of essential nutrients and ions (not just sugars), the excretion of metabolic end products and deleterious substances and communication of the cells with the environment [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Some members of the MFS are also exploited by viruses to invade host cells. Glut1, a receptor for HTLV [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was recently found to mediate glucose transport, which regulates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in human T cell lines [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Glut1 of shrimp is thought to be a putative cell surface receptor for white spot syndrome virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR), another member of the MFS, is considered to be the cell surface receptor for feline leukemia virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. HTLV and HIV infection of host cells are all regulated by Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism, via an increase in <italic>Glut1</italic> expression and to a change in the conformation of the protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These studies thus provide a precedent for the involvement of another MFS member, LsST6, in virus invasion of midgut epithelial cells in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> using a similar transport mechanism, rather than receptor-/clathrin-dependent endocytosis or membrane fusion and/or actin-based tubular structures to overcome the cell barriers. Knock down of the expression of <italic>LsST6</italic> in healthy insects of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic>, resulted in a decrease in virus acquisition after they fed on RSV-infected rice plants compared with the control insects with the functional gene. The viral titre in viruliferous insects that were similarly treated by injection with dsLsST6 had no significant changes. These results suggest that LsST6 mediates RSV entry into cells but is not involved in virus replication. On the basis of our results, we propose that LsST6 on the cell membrane of epithelial cells in the midgut mediates RSV invasion during facilitative transport of glucose/fructose from the phloem sap of rice plants across the cell membrane.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that LsST6 not only interacted with the outer capsid of RBSDV and SRBSDV, but also colocalized with each in the cell membrane of Sf9 cells, but it did not colocalize with NP of RGSV. Because <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic> can transmit both RSV and RBSDV but not RGSV, we consider that the two transmitted viruses may also require LsST6 to mediate their entry into midgut epithelial cells. Although the planthopper cannot transmit SRBSDV efficiently, previous evidence has shown that this virus does invade midgut tissues, but it does not spread into the hemolymph or other organs of SBPH [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. SRBSDV cannot break through the release barrier of the midgut because it cannot replicate enough to reach the threshold required for further spread, and/or the siRNA antiviral pathway has a direct role in controlling viral dissemination from the midgut [<xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. RGSV cannot invade the midgut epithelium of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic>, because LsST6 did not interact or colocalize with the NP of RGSV. Therefore, LsST6 might specifically mediate initial infection by the numerous viruses that are transmitted by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>striatellus</italic>. Based on all the data obtained, we propose a model by which RSV overcomes the midgut infection barrier in vector planthopper. After entering the alimentary canal of the vector insect and arriving in the midgut, intact RSV particles can bind to the midgut epithelial cells, where the NP of RSV interacts specifically with sugar transporter 6 on the cell membrane and is transported into the epithelial cells, where it replicates and finally disseminates to other parts of the vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g009">Fig 9</xref>).
