    "This study investigated the effect of rice bran fiber (RBF) and wheat fibers (WF) on microbiological and physicochemical properties of fermented sausages during ripening and storage. The experimental design included three treatments: Control, no addition; RBF, 1.5%; and WF, 1.5%. During the ripening periods, the addition of dietary fibers rapidly decreased pH and maintained high water activity values of fermented sausages (p<0.05). Lactic acid bacteria were more prevalent in fermented sausages with rice bran fiber than control and sausages with added wheat fiber. During cold storage, lower pH was observed in sausages with dietary fibers (p<0.05), and the water activity and color values were reduced as the storage period lengthened. Fermented sausages containing dietary fibers were higher in lactic acid bacteria counts, volatile basic nitrogen and 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values compared to the control (p<0.05). The results indicate that, the addition of dietary fibers in the fermented sausages promotes the growth of lactic bacteria and fermentation, and suggests that development of functional fermented sausages is possible."
