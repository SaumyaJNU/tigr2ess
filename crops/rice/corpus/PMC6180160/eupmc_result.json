    "Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causes rice bacterial blight (BB), one of the most widespread and destructive diseases in rice-growing regions worldwide. Melatonin enhances pathogen resistance by inducing plant innate immunity, but the direct effect of melatonin on plant pathogenic bacteria is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of melatonin on Xoo. Exogenous melatonin at 200 μg/mL significantly inhibited the proliferation of Xoo and reduced the mRNA expression of five genes involved in cell division. This concentration of melatonin also inhibited the motility and biofilm formation of Xoo. Notably, melatonin was observed to alter the length of Xoo cells. To provide deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying this antibacterial activity, we examined global gene expression changes in Xoo strain PXO99 in response to the application of 200 μg/mL melatonin using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A wide range of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to catalytic activity and metal-binding activity were downregulated in Xoo cells in response to the melatonin treatment. In addition, DEGs responsible for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were also downregulated. These results suggest that the inhibitory mechanism of melatonin on Xoo proliferation may involve the regulation of cell division in combination with a reduction in the concentration or activity of enzymes involved in metabolism."
