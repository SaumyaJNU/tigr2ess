    "Timely and accurate estimation of rice parameters plays a significant role in rice monitoring and yield forecasting for ensuring food security. Compact-polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a good compromise between the dual- and quad-polarized SARs, is an important part of the new generation of Earth observation systems. In this paper, the ability of CP SAR data to retrieve rice biophysical parameters was explored using a modified water cloud model. The results showed that S₁ was superior to other CP variables in rice height inversion with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.92 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.81 cm. RL was the most suitable for inverting the volumetric water content of the rice canopy, with an R² of 0.95 and a RMSE of 0.31 kg/m³. The m-χ decomposition produced the highest accuracies for the ear biomass: R² was 0.89 and RMSE was 0.17 kg/m². The highest accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) retrieval was obtained for RH (right circular transmit and horizontal linear receive) with an R² of 0.79 and a RMSE of 0.33. This study illustrated the capability of CP SAR data with respect to retrieval of rice biophysical parameters, especially for height, volumetric water content of the rice canopy, and ear biomass, and this mode may offer the best option for rice-monitoring applications because of swath coverage."
