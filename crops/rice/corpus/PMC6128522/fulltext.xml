Although there are substantial gaps in understanding these systems, the dynamics of the relationships may influence the processes of virus transmission and plant disease epidemics. Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is mainly vectored by green rice leafhoppers (GRLHs), <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic> (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in a persistently circulative manner. In this study, host plant selection preferences of non-viruliferous and viruliferous (carrying RDV) GRLHs between RDV-free and RDV-infected plants were tested. Non-viruliferous GRLHs preferred RDV-infected rice plants over RDV-free rice plants, and viruliferous GRLHs preferred RDV-free rice plants over RDV-infected rice plants. In odor selection preference bioassay using a four-field olfactometer, non-viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-infected rice plants over healthy rice and viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-free rice plants over RDV-infected ones. In 6 h plant penetration behavior bioassay using electrical penetration graphs, non-viruliferous GRLHs spent shorter time in non-penetration and much longer time in xylem feeding on RDV-infected, compared to RDV-free rice plants. Viruliferous GRLHs exhibited more salivation and stylet movement on RDV-free rice plants than on RDV-infected rice plants. We infer from these findings that RDV influences these vector behaviors by altering host plant physiology to promote viral transmission.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Program on Key Basic Research Projects</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014CB138404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4937-8867</contrib-id><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Gongyin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Special Research Projects for Developing Transgenic Plants, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08011-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4937-8867</contrib-id><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Gongyin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Projects (973 Program, 2014CB138404) and the Special Research Projects for Developing Transgenic Plants, China (2016ZX08011-001).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice dwarf virus (RDV), the pathogen causing rice dwarf disease, belongs to Reoviridae, genus <italic>Phytoreovirus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The RDV genome is composed of 12-segment double-stranded RNAs, packaged within an icosahedral double-shelled particle [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is mainly transmitted by green rice leafhopper (GRLH), <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic> (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), in a persistently circulative manner and can be transmitted transovarially to their offspring [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. GRLH acquire the RDV virus particles after feeding on infected plants, for a few minutes to several days. GRLHs are primarily xylem feeders, where they likely acquire most viruses. They can feed on several plant tissues and may acquire viruses from phloem as well. RDVs initially infect the filter chamber epithelium, where progeny virions are assembled. They spread through the digestive system and the hemolymph and finally infect the salivary glands. RDVs infect rice plants while their vector insects ingest plant sap [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Host plants, pathogens and their herbivore vectors systems have complex relationships. Plant viruses can influence their vectors, either directly (by infecting vectors) or indirectly (by infecting host plants) [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The idea that some plant viruses influence the orientation or settling behavior of their vector insects is very well documented. Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed that non-viruliferous white-backed planthoppers <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> (Hov&#x000e1;th) were more attracted to southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV)-infected plants than to non-infected plants and, conversely, viruliferous vectors preferred non-infected plants. Several virus-vector-plant systems, such as the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)&#x02014;<italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> L.&#x02014;wheat system [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the potato leaf roll virus (PLRV)&#x02014;<italic>Myzus persicae&#x02014;</italic>potato system [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)&#x02014;<italic>Frankliniella occidentalis</italic> (Pergande)&#x02014;pepper pathosystems similarly operate [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other vector-virus-host plant systems operate differently. For example, the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) decreases the quality of its host plant and its aphid vectors (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic> and <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic>) leave infected plants at higher rates, which inhibits prolonged feeding. These aphid behaviors may enhance virus transmission [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These publications prompted our question of whether GRLHs have marked preferences for plants that are either infected or not infected with viruses.</p><p>Plant viruses may influence vector penetration and feeding behavior, particularly for piercing-sucking insects. Green bugs, <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> (Rondani), begin phloem ingestion sooner and invest more time into feeding on BYDV-infected, compared to non-infected oats. They also interrupted feeding bouts less frequently [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. TSWV-infected western flower thrips, <italic>F</italic>. <italic>occidentalis</italic> (Pergande), made almost 3 times more non-ingestion probes and they salivated during these probes, both prerequisites for virus inoculation, than TSWV-free controls [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)-infected whiteflies <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> fed more often and had longer salivation phases compared to non-infected whiteflies [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Non-infected whiteflies probed faster and had more frequent feeding bouts on TYLCV-infected tomato plants [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SRBSDV-infected white-backed planthoppers, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>furcifera</italic> (Horv&#x000e1;th), salivated more on non-infected hosts compared to infected hosts and virus-free insects fed more on SRBSDV-infected hosts [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We infer that virus infection influences vector penetration and feeding behavior, which may positively influence virus transmission efficiency. The general idea is encapsulated in the &#x0201c;Vector Manipulation Hypothesis&#x0201d; (VMH) [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although it may not stand up to critical inquiry due to issues such as viral transmission barriers, insect immunity and virus-induced reductions in vector fitness [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Because the VMH is not yet settled, more research is necessary to generate broadly applicable principles of virus-insect vector-host plant pathosystems. In this study, we hypothesized that RDV infection influences the orientation and feeding behaviors of its GRLH vector. Here, we report on the outcomes of experiments designed to test our hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Leafhopper rearing</title><p>The non-viruliferous GRLH population was first collected from experimental rice fields, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2015.

We used a water-soluble silver glue to connect the dorsal thorax of the chilled insect to one end of a gold wire (D = 20 &#x003bc;m, H = 3&#x02013;4 cm). The glue was dried for about 2 min to ensure a tight junction with the insect. The wired GRLH was connected to the EPG probe via a copper nail and the probe was connected to the amplifier. The test insect was placed on rice leaf surface, noting this attachment did not hamper the insect feeding. A copper wire (D = 2 mm, H = 10 cm) was inserted into the pot soil vertically which was connected to another amplifier as the plant electrode. The electrical EPG signals were digitized with a converter (DI710-UL, Dataq, Akron, USA), and the data acquired and stored with PROBE 3.4 software (Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands) [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

In the tritrophic virus-vector-plant relationships, plant viruses can influence their vector&#x02019;s feeding, development, fitness and reproduction, either directly (by infection of vector) or indirectly (by infection of host plants) [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our data convincingly support our hypothesis that RDV infection influences the behaviors of its GRLH vector. Several points are germane. First, non-viruliferous GRLHs had a marked selection preference for RDV-infected plants over their RDV-free counterparts and, conversely, viruliferous GRLHs preferred RDV-free rice plants over RDV-infected plants. Second, non-viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-infected rice plants over RDV-free plants and viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-free plants over RDV-infected ones. Third, RDV infection influenced the penetration and feeding behavior of the tested insects. Taken together, these points document the influence of viral infection status of the host plants on the vector insect behavior.</p><p>The central point of the VMH is that parasites or their offspring must somehow move from one host to the next. The idea that parasites somehow manipulate their hosts or vectors to enhance the moving process has been in the literature for decades and it covers parasites of vertebrates and a wide range of invertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Plant pathogenic viruses change the physiology of their host plants, altering the volatile chemicals they emit and, hence odors, and also changing their spectral properties, which may change visual cues received by vectors [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In their work with aphids and barley yellow dwarf virus, Ingwell [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] show that virus-infected wheat plants are more attractive to non-infected aphids and that non-infected plants are more attractive to infected aphids. Our data similarly show that virus-infected rice plants emit odors that differ from non-infected plants. The core understanding is that parasites are able to alter the phenotypes of their host plants and insect vectors are able to detect the altered phenotypes and make choices that depend on their own infection status. Our working hypothesis is the vector insects are influenced by plant volatile organic compounds, a point now under investigation. We infer that viral infection influences host plant physiology and vector insect behavioral physiology.</p><p>Orientation or, settling behavior of vector insects, is influenced by plant viruses. Such behavior may promote pathogen acquisition and transmission, as noted in the Introduction [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The specific mechanisms of influencing vector behaviors are largely unknown, although viral infection may operate to change host plant physiology in a way that alters the composition of plant fluids and volatile organic compounds [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We suspect many viral mechanisms operate to influence their host plants. For a single example, <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (a tobacco relative) and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> are host plants for the Turnip Mosaic Virus (TMV). TMV-infected plants promote growth and reproduction of its aphid vector, <italic>Myzus persicae</italic>. Casteel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that over-expression of a single viral protein, nuclear inclusion a-protease domain (Nla-Pro), is sufficient to increase aphid growth and reproduction. More recently, they reported that the viral Nla-Pro changes its intracellular localization within host plant cells to the vacuole in the presence of aphids, which is required to promote aphid performance [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We infer that plant viruses have evolved mechanisms to create fundamental changes in host plant physiology.</p><p>RDV infection influenced GRLH penetration and feeding behavior. Non-viruliferous GRLHs spent shorter times in NP and more time in xylem feeding. These behaviors may enhance RDV acquisition. Viruliferous GRLHs spent more time in Nc2 on RDV-free plants, possibly promoting virus transfer to the plants. Reports of similar studies are consistent with our findings [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Virus inoculation leads, also, to changes in systemic plant physiology, including compositions of amino acids, carbohydrate, and other nutrients of plant fluids. Such changes have been confirmed to influence insect probing and feeding behavior and they may contribute to virus acquisition and transmission [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Pathogenic organisms have co-evolved with their host plants and vectors, affecting the performance and behavior of vectors in ways that seem to favor their spread and transmission [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the present study, host preference bioassay and feeding behavior details indicate that GRLH probing and feeding behavior were manipulated by the virus to favor itself. Generally, our findings support the hypothesis that RDV infection influences the orientation and feeding behaviors of its GRLH vector, impacting transmission and acquisition of RDV. We propose these virus-driven changes in vector insect behavior supports the VMH, as discussed just above [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the idea has not been directly tested in this work, reports indicate that virus populations and biogeography are largely determined by activity and behavior of vector insects [<xref rid="pone.0203364.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203364.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The biological significance of pathogen-influenced vector behaviors may lead to increased transmission and geographical ranges of pathogens. In our view, in the very extensive plant monocultures associated with modern agro-ecosystems, very small insects, such as planthoppers, aphids and whiteflies, require only small movements to spread pathogens. Here, we emphasize that long-term insect vector monitoring and management are necessary to minimize plant disease epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203364.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Characteristic electrical penetration graph waveforms recorded from green rice leafhoppers (GRLHs) feeding on rice plants.</title><p>(A) 100s recording of waveforms NP, Nc1 and Nc2; (B) 60s recording of waveforms Nc4; (C) 10s amplification of Nc4; (D) 60s recording of waveforms Nc5; (E) 10s amplification of Nc5.
