Kbu and Kcr are enriched at the 5&#x02032; region of expressed genes. In rice under starvation and submergence, Kbu and Kcr appear to be less dynamic and display changes in different sets of genes compared to H3K9ac.

For example, histone lysine acetylation on the &#x003b5;-amine group not only neutralizes the positive charge of the amine group, enhances the hydrophobicity, and increases the size of the lysine side chain, but also provides platforms for binding by proteins involved in chromatin and gene regulations. Histone acetylation/deacetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The level of histone acetylation is determined by the activity of both histone acetyl-transferases (HAT) and deacetylases (HDAC). Histone acetylation can be regulated by primary metabolism, as key metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and NAD+ are involved in protein acetylation and deacetylation processes, and their cellular levels may regulate the activity of HATs and HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Plant metabolism is largely regulated to adapt to the fluctuating environment. Thus, the collaborative program between epigenetic dynamics and metabolism is further interconnected with environmental cues, which may optimize plant adaptive responses and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Recently, it is shown that histones can be acylated with short-chain fatty acids, including propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, and &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrylation in animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These modifications are similar to lysine acetylation but are distinct in hydrocarbon chain length and hydrophobicity or charge. Studies in animal cells suggest that histone lysine acylations affect gene expression and may be functionally different from histone lysine acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Histone lysine acylations are shown to be regulated by metabolism. For instance, intracellular crotonyl-CoA stimulates transcription through histone crotonylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrylation is induced significantly during prolonged fasting in mouse liver and is associated with gene upregulation in starvation-responsive metabolism pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">It has been reported that histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) could be involved in histone acylation dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For instance, mammalian CBP/p300, a histone acetyltransferase, catalyzes both histone acetyl and non-acetyl acylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. All seven human sirtuins (SIRT1-7) that were originally annotated as histone deacetylases based on sequence homology to the yeast sir2 histone deacetylase, have been described as having diverse deacylase activities, albeit weaker than their deacetylase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other studies have shown that Zn-finger domain-containing HDACs are also involved in decrotonylation of histone lysine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Histone acylation has not been studied yet in plants. Being photosynthetic organisms, plants are autotrophic and there are significant differences in primary and energy metabolic and signaling pathways. For instance, glycolysis is induced under both biotic and abiotic stresses, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is particularly high during light to dark transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It remains unknown how histone acylation and acetylation interact to regulate gene expression in plants that have distinct regulatory pathways of primary metabolism.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we first analyzed rice histone butyrylation (Kbu) and crotonylation (Kcr) sites by mass spectrometry, then compared genome-wide distribution of Kbu and Kcr and lysine acetylation (H3K9ac) together with transcriptomic analysis in rice. To study whether altered metabolic activity affected histone acylations and acetylation, we treated rice plants by continuous darkness (starvation) and submergence and investigated genome-wide changes of Kbu, Kcr, and H3K9ac and gene expression. Finally, we tested histone deacylation activities of several rice HDACs. Our results indicate that Kbu and Kcr are robust histone modification marks that regulate gene expression in rice. Rice histone acylations and acetylation are dynamically regulated by environmental cues and are likely to be removed by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of rice histone lysine butyrylation (Kbu) and crotonylation (Kcr) sites</title><p id="Par9">To study whether histone lysine acylations exist in plants, we first performed immunoblotting with specific antibodies and detected histone lysine butyrylation (Kbu) and lysine crotonylation (Kcr) in Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and tobacco (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In order to identify plant histone Kbu and Kcr sites, we used previously reported mass spectrometry methods to analyze histone proteins isolated from rice seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The analysis detected Kbu at N-terminal tails of H3 (H3K14bu) and H4 (H4K12bu), and at the core region of H2B (K42 and K134) of rice histones (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1; Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). H3K14bu exists in yeast but not detected in mammalian cells, whereas H4K12bu is detected in both yeast and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Several sites of H2A and many sites of H2B were found to be crotonylated in rice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In total, 45 Kcr sites were identified in rice histones.

To study the relationship between histone acylation and histone acetylation, we also performed ChIP-seq with anti-H3K9ac antibody. More than 30,000 Kbu and Kcr peaks were identified (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), indicating that the two histone acylation modifications are widely distributed in the rice genome, although some reads/peaks may be associated with Kbu- or Kcr-modified chromatin proteins other than histones. The Kbu and Kcr modifications showed a similar genomic distribution and profile as H3K9ac in rice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The majority of Kbu and Kcr peaks were located in the genic regions, and the modifications were highly enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) of protein-coding genes and were positively related to gene expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). By contrast, histone Kbu and Kcr levels were very low in transposable element (TE)-related genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Kbu and Kcr were highly correlated with each other and with the active histone marks H3K9ac and H3K4me3, but did not correlated with H3K9me2, H3K4me2, or H3K27me3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The genomic and genic distributions of Kbu and Kcr were somewhat similar to those of H3K9ac in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A positive correlation of Kbu and Kcr with gene length was also observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Interestingly, almost all (&#x0003e;&#x02009;96%, 20,511 out of 21,375) H3K9ac-marked genes were also modified by Kbu and Kcr, while more than 5000 genes were marked by Kbu or Kcr, but not by H3K9ac (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, it is not excluded that these genes are marked by acetylation at other histone lysine residues. In these genes, Kbu and Kcr displayed relatively lower levels at TSS but higher levels in gene body (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The ChIP-seq data were validated by ChIP-qPCR tests on modified and unmodified genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).

To investigate functional relationship between Kbu, Kcr, and H3K9ac in gene expression, we analyzed expression levels of genes modified by different combinations of the marks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Genes marked by H3K9ac showed higher expression than those marked only by Kbu or Kcr. Genes marked by a combination of two marks showed higher expression than the mono-marked genes.

In genes with the three marks, those with higher portion of H3K9ac relative to Kbu or Kcr displayed higher expression levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). However, the total acylation level of genes with the three marks was not higher than those with only two marks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The analysis suggests that H3K9ac is predominant in gene activity and that Kbu and Kcr may contribute to H3K9ac-regulated active chromatin state. Genes marked by Kbu or Kcr only (tags per million mapped tags per kb, TPM &#x0003e;&#x02009;50) showed low expression levels (FPKM &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1) and were enriched in stress and abiotic stimulus responses. Many of them are highly induced under stress (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3), hypothesizing that Kbu and Kcr may play a role in poising genes for stimulus-induced activation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Kbu, Kcr, and H3K9ac changes in rice under starvation and submergence</title><p id="Par13">The substrates for histone acetylation/acylation, such as acetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, and crotonyl-CoA, are important cellular primary metabolites. Stress conditions such as prolonged darkness (starvation) or submergence (switching to anaerobic respiration) affect greatly plant primary metabolism. To study whether starvation and submergence altered Kbu/Kcr/H3K9ac, we treated rice seedlings in darkness for 48&#x000a0;h or under submergence for 6&#x000a0;h. qRT-PCR analysis of starvation and submergence-induced marker genes confirmed the effectiveness of the treatments (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4A).

Relatively fewer genes showed Kcr changes after the treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Thus, H3K9ac appeared more dynamic than Kbu and Kcr. Starvation resulted in more changes of H3K9ac than submergence, suggesting that cellular energy levels might have a higher impact on histone acetylation in plants. Interestingly, more than 50% genes that showed Kcr changes after starvation (both increase and decrease) or submergence (decrease) also showed changes of Kbu, supporting the concurrency hypothesis of the two marks on many genes.

Whether and how these epigenetic modifications affect gene expression and how they are regulated remains unknown in plants. In this work, we identified a large number of rice histone Kbu and Kcr sites in rice. Although many Kbu and Kcr sites are conserved in mammalian histones, several ones appear to be specific in plants. For instance, H3K14bu seems to exist only in plant and yeast. In addition, we showed that rice Kbu and Kcr are peaked at the TSS regions which is different from human or mouse histone Kbu and Kcr that have also a peak in enhancers at the 5&#x02032; region in addition to the TSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This may be due to architectural difference of cis-regulatory elements between plant and mammalian genes. We showed that histone Kbu and Kcr mark a large number of genes in rice. The majority of Kbu- and Kcr-marked genes are also marked by H3K9ac and are transcriptionally active, which seems to be distinct from results obtained in mammalian cells, in which it has been shown that histone acetylation dynamically competes with butyrylation of highly active gene promoters. The high degree of overlapping between H3K9ac and Kbu/Kcr in the rice genome supports the model in which genomic loci are distinguished not by the presence or absence of a particular acylation but probably by the proportional mixture of distinct acylations. The differential changes of H3K9ac and Kbu/Kcr induced by starvation and submergence suggest that environmental and metabolic cues control proportion of histone acylations in plants, which controls the expression of responsive genes. Several recent studies in animal cells have demonstrated that alterations in the proportional mixture of histone acylations have functional consequences and correlate with distinct physiological states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Higher correlations between H3K9ac and expression changes compared to Kbu and Kcr observed in this study suggest that histone acylations may provide a platform for H3K9ac during gene activation in plants. In line with this hypothesis is data showing that Kbu may poise for stress-induced gene activation. The observations that starvation and submergence induced changes of H3K9ac and Kbu/Kcr from different sets of genes and that relatively few genes showed concurrent changes between expression and Kbu or Kcr suggest that the two histone acylation marks and H3K9ac have non-redundant functions in these contexts. Therefore, relative levels of histone acylation and acetylation regulated by environmental and metabolic changes may be a mechanism that fine-tunes regulation of gene expression for plant adaptation.</p><p id="Par21">It has been shown that histone acetyltransferases, such as CBP/p300, catalyze both histone acetyl and non-acetyl acylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and that the different acyl-CoAs compete for binding to the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Acetyl-CoA produced from cytosolic/nucleic citrate by ATP citrate lyase (ACL) is the major source for histone acetylation. Depletion of acetyl-CoA by knockdown of <italic>ACL</italic> reduces histone lysine acetylation in both animal and plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Reduction of the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of acetyl-CoA led to an increase in CBP/p300-catalyzed Kcr in animal cells and the increase in Kcr could be reduced by replenishing the acetyl-CoA pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, under conditions in which acetyl-CoA is reduced, other acyl-CoA forms will be used more often to modify histones. The relative stability of Kbu and Kcr in rice under starvation and submergence may be due to the possibility that under these conditions tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity is low resulting in lower cytosolic/nuclear acetyl-CoA, which may be in favor of stabilizing histone Kbu/Kcr acylation. Furthermore, the differential dynamism between H3K9ac and Kbu/Kcr during starvation and submergence may be also related to difference in their erasure mechanism, as only the mutation of <italic>ossrt2</italic> had an effect on Kcr, while the three tested HDAC (SRT1, SRT2, and HDA705) all resulted in increases of H3K9ac (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This is in line with the suggestion that non-acetyl histone acylation is mainly removed by sirtuin HDACs, while lysine acetylation can be reversed by both sirtuin and Zn-containing HDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although mammalian HDAC1 is shown to have a decrotonylase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] . However, it is not excluded that anti-Kbu and anti-Kcr antibodies that detect the modifications at all histone sites may not readily detect changes at specific histone lysine sites. A mixture of signals (Kcr or Kbu on different lysines) may change less compared to a single modification (H3K9ac). In addition, Kbu/Kcr/H3K9ac may be regulated at different time points during the stresses. It is also not excluded other factors related to stresses may be involved in the differential changes of histone acylations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par22">We identified many plant histone Kbu and Kcr sites, which mark a large number of genes in rice. Kbu and Kcr sites are enriched at 5&#x02032; region of active genes and most of the H3K9ac-marked genes are co-marked by Kbu and Kcr. However, histone Kbu, Kcr, and H3K9ac display different dynamics in responding to environmental and metabolic cues and have non-redundant functions in gene activation in rice under starvation and submergence. Histone acylation (i.e., Kbu) are likely to poise genes for stress induction and provide a platform for H3K9ac during gene activation in plant. Our data indicate that the proportion of rice histone lysine acetylation and acylation is dynamically regulated by environmental and metabolic signals, which may serve as a mechanism to fine-tune epigenetic control of plant adaptation to environmental variation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant material and treatments</title><p id="Par23">Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) wild type and mutant or RNAi plants were germinated and grown on hormone-free, one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium under 16/8&#x000a0;h of light/dark at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C/25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

About 2-g samples were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and suspended in 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L reaction buffer.</p><p id="Par35">Reactions were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in a final volume of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L per well in a 96-well microplate. Briefly, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of Boc-Lys(crotonyl)-AMC stocking solution (10&#x000a0;mM) and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g purified protein or 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L nuclear lysis were added to the reaction buffer (25&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, 130&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 3.0&#x000a0;mM KCl, 1&#x000a0;mM MgCl2, 0.1% PEG8000, 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M NAD<sup>+</sup>, pH = 8.0) and incubated at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h. The reaction was then stopped by adding 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of trypsin solution (25&#x000a0;mM Tris-HCl, 130&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 3.0&#x000a0;mM KCl, 1&#x000a0;mM MgCl, 30% isopropanol, 0.01&#x000a0;mg/mL trypsin, pH = 8.0). The resulting solvent was mixed and incubated at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for another 1&#x000a0;h. The fluorescence was analyzed by a fluorescence plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths at 355&#x000a0;nm and 460&#x000a0;nm, respectively. Boc-Lys(crotonyl)-AMC were gifted by Prof. Yingming Zhao&#x02019;s lab.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p id="Par36">Gene ontology classification provided in Rice Genome Annotation Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu</ext-link>/) was used to assign genes to a hierarchical biological process following the criteria of the Gene Ontology Consortium databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/tigr2go">http://www.geneontology.org/external2go/tigr2go</ext-link>).
