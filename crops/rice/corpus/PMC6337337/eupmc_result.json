    "Herb genomics and comparative genomics provide a global platform to explore the genetics and biology of herbs at the genome level. Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer is an important medicinal plant for a variety of bioactive chemical compounds of which the biosynthesis may involve transport of a wide range of substrates mediated by oligopeptide transporters (OPT). However, information about the OPT family in the plant kingdom is still limited. Only 17 and 18 OPT genes have been characterized for Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. Additionally, few comprehensive studies incorporating the phylogeny, gene structure, paralogs evolution, expression profiling, and co-expression network between transcription factors and OPT genes have been reported for ginseng and other species. In the present study, we performed those analyses comprehensively with both online tools and standalone tools. As a result, we identified a total of 268 non-redundant OPT genes from 12 flowering plants of which 37 were from ginseng. These OPT genes were clustered into two distinct clades in which clade-specific motif compositions were considerably conservative. The distribution of OPT paralogs was indicative of segmental duplication and subsequent structural variation. Expression patterns based on two sources of RNA-Sequence datasets suggested that some OPT genes were expressed in both an organ-specific and tissue-specific manner and might be involved in the functional development of plants. Further co-expression analysis of OPT genes and transcription factors indicated 141 positive and 11 negative links, which shows potent regulators for OPT genes. Overall, the data obtained from our study contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the OPT gene family in ginseng and other flowering plants. This genetic resource will help improve the interpretation on mechanisms of metabolism transportation and signal transduction during plant development for Panax ginseng."
