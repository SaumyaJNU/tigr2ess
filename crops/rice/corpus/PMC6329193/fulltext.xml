Eighteen root samples with three replications were collected to perform multiple comparisons of enzyme activity and biochemical substance contents. The findings indicated that VW resistance was positively correlated with peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity, but negatively correlated with malondialdehyde content. Additionally, RNA sequencing was used for the same root samples, resulting in a total of 77,412 genes, of which 23,180 differentially expressed genes were identified from multiple comparisons between samples. After Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis on the expression profiles identified using Short Time-series Expression Miner, we found that the metabolic process in the biological process, as well as the pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, participated significantly in the response to VW. Gene functional annotation and expression quantity analysis indicated the important roles of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway and oxidation-reduction process in response to VW, which also provided plenty of candidate genes related to plant resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This study concentrates on the preliminary response to V991 infection by comparing the VW-resistant CSSL and its VW-susceptible recurrent parent.

Verticillium wilt (VW), a representative vascular disease mainly caused by the infection of <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> Kleb., and the soil-borne fungus can cause leaf yellowing, wilt, defoliation, and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cotton VW is the most destructive disease, presently tremendously affecting cotton yield and fiber performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Initially described on upland cotton in 1914 in the USA, VW was subsequently introduced into China via the importation of American cotton species, resulting in substantial cotton yield losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> can cause wilt disease on more than 200 plant species, indicating its extensive range of host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The microsclerotia (melanized survival structures) formed by the soil-borne pathogen can survive in the soil for over 10&#x02009;years, with germination being triggered by root exudate signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are no appropriate commercial fungicides available for <italic>G. hirsutum</italic>, while <italic>G. barbadense,</italic> despite possessing innate resistance to VW and premium fiber quality, experiences low-fiber productivity upon infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The above-mentioned conditions reduce the effectiveness of common cultivation practices, such as crop rotation, chemical fumigation, and soil conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, the development of new cotton cultivars possessing VW resistance by means of traditional breeding and transgenic strategies is the most practical and cost effective method to manage cotton VW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given the increasing human population and diminishing arable land, the development of novel varieties harboring high yield, superior fiber quality, and VW resistance remains a significant topic in cotton breeding. In response, chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) have emerged as a means of combining the advantages of both upland and Sea Island cotton. Through conventional breeding methods, such as hybridization, backcrossing, selfing, and marker assisted-selection (MAS), CSSLs were developed as the ideal materials for further genome research and crop improvement. CSSLs have been preferentially applied to the quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for essential traits, such as yield, quality, disease resistance, and stress tolerance in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Plants have evolved two-layered immune mechanisms to protect themselves against various pathogens with different invasion strategies. The first-layer defense principally occurs on the extracellular surface of the host cell, where the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), further causing PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) by the stimulation of PRRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although most pathogens are blocked by the basal immune response, some are able to successfully invade and suppress PTI through the deliverance of pathogenic effector proteins into the host cells via a type III secretion system (TTSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Subsequently, the specific resistance (R) genes encoding nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains recognize these pathogen effectors, ultimately activating the second-layer defense mechanism, namely, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Plant defense reactions in response to diverse pathogens are triggered along with the recognition of the PRRs and R genes, further causing a localized activation of programmed cell death (PCD), also known as the hypersensitive response (HR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Plenty of R proteins in plants share two typical domains: a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The former constitutes part of the nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC adaptor shared by the apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF-1), R proteins, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homolog domain 4 (CED-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], while the latter proteins play a central role in the biological processes of plant growth and development, including the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Based on the N-terminal domain categories, plant NBS-LRR proteins can be classified into toll/interleukin-1 receptors (TIR) and coiled-coil (CC), respectively referred to as TIR-NBS-LRR and CC-NBS-LRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Along with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies, diploid and allotetraploid <italic>Gossypium</italic> species have been successfully sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], which has improved our understanding of cotton polyploid properties and provided a solid foundation for further functional genomics. Transcriptome sequencing, also known as RNA-Seq, concentrates on gene expression and transcriptional regulation, making it suitable for revealing the molecular mechanisms of particular biological processes. RNA-Seq has been widely applied to identify the key signaling pathways or resistant genes in response to VW not only in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], but also in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], smoke tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], sunflower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the phenylalanine pathway, which includes lignin and flavonoid biosynthesis, has been reported to be associated with VW resistance and is similarly regulated by some enzyme activities and biochemical substances, including polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">In the present study, VW resistance investigations in artificial greenhouse, natural field, and disease nursery conditions were first conducted, and MBI8255, the VW-resistant CSSL, and CCRI36, the VW-susceptible recurrent parent, were subsequently used to perform biochemical tests during the preliminary stages of the V991 infection process (0, 1, and 2&#x02009;days after inoculation, DAI), which included assessing the activities of CAT, POD, SOD, PAL, and PPO, and the contents of MDA, proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein. Additionally, RNA-Seq was carried out on the same samples, and plenty of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relevant to VW resistance were identified, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis.

Although three replications in the greenhouse tests were carried out with different numbers of paper cups (five seedlings per cup; the first replication included five cups, the second replication included seven cups, and the third replication contained 10 cups), the total number of seedlings for either the resistant control (Zhongzhimian2) or the susceptible control (Jimian11) was sufficient for the disease evaluation. This not only increases the accuracy, but also reduces the experimental error. Based on the greenhouse results, the DI values of MBI8255 and CCRI36 were relatively close to those of Zhongzhimian2 and Jimian11 at 15 DAI, respectively.

The four lines in Anyang showed higher DI values than those in Xinjiang at the flowering stage, but presented relatively low DI values in Anyang at the mature stage, except in CCRI36. These variations in the field results could be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the infection of plants by a combination of VW strains, different locations with diverse quantities and virulence levels of soil fungus, and various developmental and environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. For the disease nursery tests, only one replicate of MBI8255, CCRI36, and Jimian11 was conducted in Kaifeng, while the susceptible control showed 56.77% DI, which was slightly higher than in either the greenhouse or field tests. Although presenting a more similar DI to that at 15 DAI or the flowering stage of the greenhouse and field tests, MBI8255 and CCRI36 separately exhibited resistance and susceptibility to VW, which might be due to the insufficient number of sampled plants. In combination with the greenhouse, field, and disease nursery results, the selected CSSL, MBI8255, proved to be resistant to VW despite showing a slightly higher DI than the resistant control, Zhongzhimian2.

In order to repair the damage caused by ROS in response to pathogen infection, plants enhance the activities of antioxidative enzymes, such as CAT, SOD, POD, and PPO.

Furthermore, POD activity in MBI8255 was significantly higher than in CCRI36 at 0 and 2 DAI, which indicated that in comparison to the susceptible recurrent parent, the resistant CSSL possessed higher POD activity regardless of V991 infection. With regards to the two defense enzymes, only PPO activity in the two lines at 2 DAI differed significantly, while the VW-resistant line presented higher PAL and POD activities than the VW-susceptible line, except for PAL activity at 1 DAI. This indicated a clear correlation between VW resistance and POD activity, and furthermore, that the resistant line had higher PAL and POD activity in response to V991 infection.

However, sufficient evidence is lacking to prove a close correlation between PAL activity and VW resistance, although higher activities were identified in the resistant line, which did not corroborate previous studies.

However, an obvious correlation between VW resistance and the contents of proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein was not detected, and no significant differences were found between either the two lines at the same stage, or between MBI8255 or CCRI36 at the different stages.

Eighteen root samples derived from the VW-resistant MBI8255 and VW-susceptible CCRI36 were collected at 0, 1, and 2 DAI of V991 infection. Library construction and transcriptome sequencing of these samples produced a total of 908.547 million clean reads (approximately 136.27 Gb data) with more than 91.38% of the Q30 value and over 43.44% of the GC content. No less than 87.69% of the clean reads were successfully mapped to the reference genome and were subsequently subjected to assembly, ultimately obtaining 77,412 genes, including 6934 novel genes. PCC analyses were used to confirm the relationships of the different samples, and high similarities were found among the three replicates of each sample and also in the samples from the same stages, which confirmed the reliability of our RNA-Seq data.</p><p id="Par87">Through multiple comparisons between the samples, 23,180 genes (1816 novel genes) were differentially expressed in response to V991 infection, with more down-regulated genes than up-regulated genes observed. Adopting STEM analysis to investigate the temporal expression patterns of the total DEGs, three profiles (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) per line were identified, and GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on up-regulated profile&#x000a0;7 and down-regulated profile&#x000a0;2, which exhibited the same patterns. In the two profiles, metabolic process and cellular process, binding and catalytic activity, and cell part and cell were the most abundant subcategories in biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, respectively. The genes clustered into the same GO terms in MBI8255 and CCRI36 showed opposite patterns, and there were more enriched genes of CCRI36 over those of MBI8255 in profile&#x000a0;7 while presenting less enriched genes of CCRI36 than those of MBI8255 in profile&#x000a0;2. Based on the KEGG results, only two pathways, namely, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction, in the two profiles or in the two lines, were significantly enriched, and more genes were clustered in CCRI36 than in MBI8255 in the up-regulated expression pattern (profile&#x000a0;7), while more genes were down-regulated in MBI8255 than in CCRI36 (profile&#x000a0;2). The consistency between the GO and KEGG results might be due to the diverse strategies adopted in response to V991 infection by the different resistant or susceptible lines. With regards to the enriched metabolic processes in our results, secondary metabolism pathways were found to play particularly significant roles in response to V991 infection and they have been reported to participate in the abiotic stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].

In this study, the majority of the key enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway were analyzed based on the combined RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR results. Diverse expression patterns were observed in response to V991 infection, mostly presented by the up-regulation of lignin biosynthesis-related enzymes rather than flavonoid synthesis-related enzymes, which might result from the antagonistic relationships between the two synthesis pathways. Nevertheless, our findings still indicate the positive effect of V991 infection on the phenylpropanoid pathway in CCRI36 and MBI8255, further promoting lignin biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par89">During the synthesis pathways of G and S type lignins, most genes showed up-regulated expression patterns, including C3H, CCR, and CAD, while only one down-regulated gene, COMT, was identified, which represented the difficult shift from caffeic acid to ferulic acid during the synthesis of S and G type lignins. Furthermore, the up-regulated CCoAOMT, which transforms caffeoyl CoA to feruloyl CoA, might be efficiently utilized to obtain adequate lignin, as has been reported in switchgrass and duckweed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

Under V991 infection, only two SOD genes showed up-regulated expression patterns in CCRI36, but presented down-regulation after up-regulation in MBI8255, which was consistent with the SOD results of the biochemical tests, indicating the significant roles of the two enzymes in ROS scavenging pathways. APX or CAT were mainly down-regulated in CCRI36, but were up-regulated following the down-regulation in MBI8255. Similar results were observed with regards to the activity changes of MDAR, GPXs, and PreR. In the two lines, in addition to the up-regulation and then down-regulation of AOX enzymes, ferritin and Trx were continuously up-regulated, which suggested their positive participation in ROS scavenging pathways. Therefore, under <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection, ROS generation increased in both CCRI36 and MBI8255, subsequently leading to the activation of ROS scavenging pathways to protect the plants. In contrast, the resistant line exhibited relatively higher ROS scavenging-related enzyme activity than the susceptible line, which might be due to the resistant line possessing a relatively well-developed ROS scavenging system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Plant resistance in response to V991 infection</title><p id="Par92">The process of pathogen infection starts from an influx of calcium and an oxidative burst triggered by PAMPs, and subsequently activates not only the MAPK pathway and calcium-dependent protein kinase, but also stomatal closure and transcriptional reprogramming, ultimately resulting in SA accumulation and callose deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].

As numerous genes were annotated as R genes, only those with high-level expression were further investigated, although more genes encoding the second-type R domain were observed. With regards to the first-type R genes, up-regulated expression patterns were identified in the two highly expressed genes, Gh_D05G0053 and Gh_D05G3603, with the former showing higher expression in MBI8255 than in CCRI36, except at 0 DAI, while the latter presented no significant difference between the expression levels of the two lines at the same stage.

In the two lines, one MOS2 gene (Gh_A05G2156) was persistently down-regulated, while two ZED1 genes, Gh_A12G0580 and Gh_D12G0592, were up-regulated. Four MLP-like genes with high-level expression, Gh_D02G1410, Gh_D02G1446, Gh_D07G2407, and Gh_D02G0560, were investigated, with the former two being up-regulated in CCRI36 and first up-regulated and then down-regulated in MBI8255, while the latter two showed up-regulation following down-regulation in the two lines. Both pathogenesis-related 4 (Gh_D11G2592) and PYR1-like 2 (Gh_A04G0244) were up-regulated in the two lines, and the same pattern was observed in the three genes encoding P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily proteins (Gh_A12G1852, Gh_A12G1867, and Gh_D12G2022) in CCRI36, with opposite expressions observed between the former and the latter two.

Finally, expression profiling of the DEGs related to the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, oxidation-reduction process, and plant resistance was carried out to identify the key candidate genes or pathways, which provided an abundance of information for revealing the mechanisms of VW resistance.

After being purified from total RNA by poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, mRNA was fragmented into 150&#x02013;200&#x02009;nt RNA inserts, which were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA by random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and the second-strand cDNA by DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. End-repair and adaptor ligation were performed on the double-stranded cDNA. The suitable fragments were purified with an AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) and enriched by PCR amplification. Subsequently, PCR products were purified using the AMPure XP system and assessment of library quality was performed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. For cluster generation, a cBot Cluster Generation System was used for clustering of the index-coded samples by the TruSeq Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). In total, 18 cDNA libraries constructed from 18 RNA-Seq samples (two cotton lines at 0, 1, and 2 DAI with three replications) and were sequenced on a flow cell with an Illumina HiSeq&#x02122; 2500 sequencing platform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data quality control and read mapping to the reference genome</title><p id="Par107">The raw data in FASTQ format were first processed through in-house Perl scripts, resulting in read sequences and their corresponding base qualities.
