    "The polysaccharide is the main active substance contained in Hericium erinaceus and is commonly used in the treatment of neurasthenia, tumors, and digestive diseases. Six intracellular polysaccharide components were obtained from H. erinaceus fruiting bodies cultivated by ARTP (atmospheric and room temperature plasma) mutagenic strain (321) and the original strain (0605), respectively. This study was designed to investigate the physicochemical characteristics of these polysaccharide components and their potential immunomodulatory activities on RAW264.7 macrophages. The results showed that the yield of fruiting body cultivated by mutated strain increased by 22% and the polysaccharide content improved by 16% compared with the original one owing to ARTP mutagenesis. The molecular weight distribution and the monosaccharide compositions of polysaccharide components from H. erinaceus induced by ARTP mutagenesis were significantly different from that of the original one. The NO, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, and TNF-α production activities of macrophages were enhanced by stimulation of 20% ethanol precipitated polysaccharides from H. erinaceus induced by ARTP mutagenesis. These results indicated that ARTP is an efficient and practical method for high polysaccharide content breeding of the H. erinaceus strain and this provided a reference for obtaining high quality resources and healthy product development from H. erinaceus."
