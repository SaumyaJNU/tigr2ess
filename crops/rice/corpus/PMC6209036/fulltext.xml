Assays based on the Folin&#x02013;Ciocalteu colorimetric method confirmed that the residual stream contained large amounts of phenolic compounds. Three antioxidant assays were employed to evaluate the bioactivity of the residual stream. Strong linear correlations existed among the release of phenolic compounds, saccharification efficiency, and antioxidant activity. The alkaline pretreatment provided a much greater release of phenolic compounds, especially phenolic acids, compared to the acid pretreatment, and consequently, it had stronger linear correlations than the acid pretreatment. Antibacterial experiments demonstrated the ability of the phenolic compounds in the residual stream to inhibit the growth of microorganisms, indicating the potential of these compounds as antimicrobial agents. To discuss the possibility of the co-production of antimicrobial agents and biofuels/biochemicals, both acid and alkaline pretreatments were optimized using response surface methodology. Under the optimal conditions, 285.7&#x000a0;g glucose could be produced from 1&#x000a0;kg rice straw with the co-production of 3.84&#x000a0;g FA and 6.98&#x000a0;g <italic>p</italic>-CA after alkaline pretreatment. These results show that the recovery of phenolic compounds from the residual stream could be a green strategy for the low-cost bioconversion of rice straw.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s12010-018-2751-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rice straw</kwd><kwd>Antioxidant activity</kwd><kwd>Phenolic compounds</kwd><kwd>Pretreatment</kwd><kwd>Biorefinery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Special Fund for Agroscientific Research in the Public Interest</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 201503135-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Min-Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Scientific Research Projects of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 14540500600, No. 16391902000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Min-Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 21307093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jiajun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Tin Ka Ping Education Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>Mainland Visiting Scholars Exchange Programme 2016/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>Yiu Fai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice straw is considered to account for the largest portion of available biomass feedstock in the world, and Asia is responsible for 90% of its annual global production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It shows promise as a raw material for the production of biofuels and biomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, rice straw contains large amounts of lignin and complex polysaccharides, which make it difficult to hydrolyze it to fermentable sugars. Therefore, pretreatment is an essential step in obtaining highly efficient saccharification and fermentation. Thus far, both acid and alkaline pretreatments have been used to improve enzymatic accessibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After pretreatment, the cellulose and hemicellulose in rice straw can be easily hydrolyzed enzymatically into monosaccharides, and thus converted by microorganisms into biofuels and biomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the bioconversion of rice straw is very costly. For that reason, a method should be developed for the integrated bioconversion of rice straw to biofuels/biomaterials with high added-value by-products to bring down the overall cost for the bioconversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Rice straw contains a wide range of phenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our previous study, it was found that phenolic compounds could be released during saccharification of rice straw, and these phenolic compounds exhibited high antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, they markedly inhibited the growth of lactic acid bacteria and consequently lowered the efficiency of lactic acid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A similar inhibitory effect on cellulase production by <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic> has also been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, the phenolic compounds need to be removed before saccharification or fermentation to improve the efficiency of the whole process for bioconversion of rice straw. The effect of the recovery of phenolic acids on the cost for ethanol production was discussed, coming the conclusion that the recovery of phenolic acids could significantly reduce the total cost for ethanol production. To lower the inhibitory effect of phenolic acids on yeast growth, an extraction process was needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Most phenolic acids are ether-linked to lignin and polysaccharides, and the linked phenolic acid could be released by the aids of acid and alkali. During acid or alkaline pretreatments, therefore, phenolic compounds would be released from the rice straw. Commonly, there are two ways to conduct the following saccharification: (1) by first separating the rice straw from the pretreatment liquid, followed by saccharification of the solid fraction, and (2) by saccharification of the rice straw without separation. The latter method could bring about a decrease in fermentation efficiency due to the presence of phenolic compounds and other inhibitors formed during the pretreatments, while the former method could result in the discharge of residual stream, which has a high total organic carbon (TOC) value, containing polysaccharides and polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a common viewpoint of bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to useful materials, higher temperature and acid/alkaline concentration leads to larger release of inhibitors, resulting in poorer performance of the subsequent process. The common studies on lignocellulosic biomass are focused on how to reduce the release of the inhibitors. Therefore, the former way was considered to be the better way for lowering the cost for bioconversion due to the fewer inhibitors and residual stream. In this study, it was confirmed that the residual stream exhibited high antioxidant activity. If the antioxidants could be produced as by-products during the pretreatment process, the cost of the bioconversion of rice straw into useful materials would be markedly reduced. According to this finding, the former method was considered as an integrated process that could produce antioxidants in the pretreatment step and then monosaccharides in the saccharification step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. If the antioxidants could be produced as by-products during the pretreatment process, the cost of the bioconversion of rice straw into useful materials would be markedly reduced.</p><p id="Par4">Although pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomasses have been intensively investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], information on the relationship of release of phenolic compounds and saccharification efficiency is scarce. Accordingly, the aims of the present study were to compare the effects of dilute acid or alkaline pretreatment conditions (temperature, time, and concentration) on the release of phenolic compounds and the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated rice straw, and consequently on the antioxidant activity of the phenolic compounds in the residual stream, using response surface methodology (RSM). Then, the relationships among the phenolic acids released, enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated rice straw, and antioxidant activities were investigated. Lastly, we explored an integrated pretreatment concept, which aims to simultaneously produce glucose and high-value antioxidants from the residual stream derived from the pretreatment process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of high-value antioxidants as by-products of the pretreatment of rice straw.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rice Straw</title><p id="Par5">Rice straw was obtained from several fields on Chongming Island, Shanghai, China.

On the other hand, the saccharification of the acid-pretreated rice straw was significantly affected by the enzyme loading. The glucose yield increased in proportion to the cellulase loading.

According to the results, it has been demonstrated that the phenolic compounds of rice straw obtained under severe alkaline conditions have potential antimicrobial effects.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Inhibition results for the different alkaline pretreatment supernatants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Run</th><th rowspan="2">Alkaline (%, <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>)</th><th rowspan="2">Temp (&#x000b0;C)</th><th rowspan="2">Time (min)</th><th rowspan="2">TP (mg GAE&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> straw)</th><th colspan="2">Inhibition zone (cm)</th></tr><tr><th>

To discuss the significance of co-production of glucose and phenolic compounds, the pretreatment processes were optimized by maximizing the desirability of all the responses. Optimum conditions of the alkaline pretreatment were found to be 1.96% NaOH (%, <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), 32.44&#x000a0;min, and 128.9&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, while optimum conditions of the acid pretreatment were 1.94% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (%, <italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>), 28.45&#x000a0;min, and 130&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Under these conditions, the experimental values were in agreement with the predicted values (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), and the glucose yields, antioxidant activities, and phenolic compound contents of the supernatants are given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Comparing the experimental values, the optimal alkaline pretreatment conditions gave approximately 1.51-fold higher glucose yield, 1.22-fold higher ABTS activity, 1.39-fold higher FRAP activity, and 2.03-fold higher DPPH activity than the acid pretreatment. As for the phenolic acids in the supernatants, the alkaline-based extract had approximately 2.26-fold higher TP contents, 15.19-fold higher <italic>p</italic>-CA content, and 4.59-fold higher FA content compared to the acid pretreatment.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Overall mass balance for the processes for co-production of phenolic compounds and glucose. <bold>a</bold> Acid pretreatment. <bold>b</bold> Alkaline pretreatment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12010_2018_2751_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par30">The antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the phenolic compounds render them effective as food preservatives. However, it should be noted that phenolic compounds obtained via chemical methods would have fewer applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries than those obtained via biological methods. Therefore, the possibility of the use of phenolic compounds as antimicrobial agents was investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, phenolic compounds could be used as biological pesticides because they could be produced in large quantities due to the huge amounts of available rice straw. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, from 600 to 900 million tons of rice straw are produced globally every year. Under the optimum conditions of the alkaline pretreatment, 285.7&#x000a0;kg of glucose could be produced from 1&#x000a0;t of rice straw with the release of 26.79&#x000a0;kg of TP containing 3.84&#x000a0;kg of FA and 6.98&#x000a0;kg of <italic>p</italic>-CA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In addition, the supernatant from 1&#x000a0;t of rice straw would exhibit 67.92, 67.33, and 45.51&#x000a0;mol equivalent of ascorbic acid in ABTS, FRAP, and DPPH antioxidant activities. The large amount of phenolic compounds derived from rice straw would markedly reduce the cost of the biological pesticide, and consequently reduce the demand for chemical pesticides, leading to green sustainable production of crops.</p><p id="Par31">The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the phenolic compounds derived from rice straw exhibit high inhibitory effects on the growth of pathogens, giving us a new insight into the application of phenolic compounds as antimicrobial agents. These phenolic compounds could be separated and purified by chromatographic methods or adsorption. The production of phenolic compounds could be considered to be a strategy for lowering the total cost of the bioconversion of rice straw, and the resulting residual stream could be easily treated via an activated sludge process due to the decrease in total organic carbon value and antimicrobial activity. In future studies, the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds on plant pathogens should be investigated in detail.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">In this study, it was confirmed that the residual stream of acid and alkaline pretreatments of rice straw exhibited high antioxidant activities. Response surface methodology was successful in developing an adequate model that describes the enzymatic saccharification and the release and antioxidant activities of the phenolic compounds. Acid and alkaline concentrations were demonstrated to be the most significant parameters affecting all response values. The antioxidant activities were strongly linearly correlated with the contents of phenolic compounds and the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of glucose. The phenolic compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on pathogens, suggesting their potential as biological pesticides. The co-production of antimicrobial agents and biofuels/biomaterials could enable expansion of the scope of applications of rice straw with good prospects for enhanced applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><p>
