ALSV, an RNA virus, can infect a wide variety of plant species including major horticultural plants without inducing symptoms. Here, methodologies were developed for infection of ALSV vectors to strawberry seedlings and plantlets cultured in vitro. A seed-propagated F<sub>1</sub> hybrid strawberry cultivar 'Yotsuboshi' was aseptically grown on half-strength Murashige&#x02013;Skoog medium for 1 month and true leaves were inoculated with an ALSV RNA preparation by particle bombardment. ALSV vector infection rates varied from 58 to 100% according to the insertion sequences, in &#x02018;Yotsuboshi&#x02019; seedlings. Plantlets (&#x02018;Dover&#x02019;) propagated in vitro could also be infected with ALSV vector at a similar infection rate. For virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we prepared an ALSV vector carrying a 201 nucleotide segment of the strawberry <italic>phytoene desaturase</italic> gene. &#x02018;Yotsuboshi&#x02019; and &#x02018;Dover&#x02019; plants infected by this vector generated completely white leaves at fifth or sixth true leaves and above. For virus-induced flowering (VIF), we used an ALSV vector expressing the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana flowering locus T</italic> gene. Strawberry seedlings infected by this vector started to flower from about 2 months post inoculation and bore fruits with viable seeds. The ALSV vector was no longer detected in any of the seedlings from early-flowered strawberries. Thus, the ALSV vector may be beneficial for examination of gene functions by VIGS in strawberry, and VIF using ALSV vector constitutes an effective new plant breeding technique for the promotion of cross-breeding in strawberry.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Viral vectors: Easy gene modification in strawberries</title><p id="Par2">Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) offers a powerful tool to reveal strawberry gene function and induce early flowering.

Despite the long cultivation history of strawberries from the fiteenth century, strawberry breeding remains a major concern of farmers and researchers with regard to a variety of traits such as fruit quality (taste), fruit colour, fruit firmness, fruit storability, ascorbic acid content, everblooming habit, disease resistance and heat/cold resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Changes in these agronomically important traits are expected to be caused by mutations in genomic DNA. For example, the everblooming (continuous flowering) trait of woodland strawberry (<italic>Fragaria vesca</italic>) is caused by a 2&#x02009;bp deletion in the coding region of the <italic>KSN</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, a strawberry homologue of the <italic>Terminal Flower 1</italic> (<italic>TFL1</italic>) gene. The genetic mapping approach has also identified the <italic>FaOMT</italic> gene mutation as the regulator of variation in the release of mesifurane, one of the volatiles of strawberry fruit, based on complete co-segregation of the identified 30-bp mutation in the <italic>FaOMT</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Specific genetic mutations causing changes in other agronomically important traits in strawberry remain mostly unknown, although candidate genes are being suggested through experimental efforts such as gene expression analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The release of genomic sequences and reports of thousands of DNA markers to detect polymorphisms on the chromosomes are also expected to greatly accelerate both forward and reverse genetic studies of strawberry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Such knowledge with regard to agronomically important genes and their mutations both informs basic plant biology and accelerates strawberry breeding based on DNA information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Following identification of agronomically important or candidate genes, their characterization by genetic overexpression or suppression represents a standard strategy for confirmation of their functions. The protocol for genetic transformation of strawberry by <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> was first established in 1990<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Whereas the transformation efficiency is generally around 5%, the efficiency may be increased up to 100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, although transformation rate appears to depend on the strawberry cultivar. Specifically, 100% transformation efficiency was achieved in an everbearing (day-neutral) cultivar &#x02018;Calypso&#x02019;, using the super-virulent <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strain AGL0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Transient expression/suppression by infiltration of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> into strawberry fruits has also been utilized for rapid analysis of gene functions. In this case, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> causes overexpression or RNA interference of the target gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, depending on the nucleotide sequence introduced into the transfer DNA region of the binary plasmid. The target strawberry gene may also be suppressed via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Considering that genetic transformation typically requires 15 months from the start of the experiments to the production of strawberry fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, these transient systems enable much faster estimation of gene function than stable transformation, although the genes are expressed/suppressed only in sections within strawberry fruits (more strictly, receptacles). Alternatively, genes can be expressed/suppressed in whole strawberry fruits when <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> is repeatedly injected into fruits at least three times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Such transient systems are currently utilized for the analysis of gene functions with regard to strawberry fruit phenotypes, such as pigmentation, aroma generation, ripening and disease resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Genes can also be transiently expressed in strawberry leaves by infiltration of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> for the analysis of their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Once agronomically important mutations in the genome are identified, they can be combined by cross-breeding and DNA marker selection. However, the long generation time of crops often constitutes a major problem for efficient cross-breeding. Although the genomes of vegetatively propagated cultivars/crops such as apple and pear remain genetically heterozygous, short generation time is also important when the crop genome is homogenized for establishment of seed-propagated genetically homozygous cultivars/crops and F<sub>1</sub> hybrid cultivars/crops, such as rice and maize. Thus, in addition to controlling growth conditions such as cultivation in greenhouse or incubator, high CO<sub>2</sub> levels, tiller removal, paclobutrazol treatment, grafting on rootstock, and embryo rescue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, transgenic expression of the <italic>leafy</italic> or <italic>flowering locus T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) gene or suppression of the <italic>TFL1</italic> gene also comprise important techniques for inducing early flowering and reducing generation time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Virus-induced flowering (VIF) can also be effective for reducing the generation time of crops. In VIF, crops are infected with RNA virus vectors expressing an <italic>FT</italic> gene to induce early flowering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. An advantage of VIF is that the genomic DNA of crops is not transformed, and the infected transgenic virus is rarely carried to the progeny (next-generation) plants. In addition, virus infection does not depend on the specific crop cultivar in many cases. Rather, infectivity of virus vectors depends on the host range of viruses; thus, zucchini yellow mosaic virus has been used for the expression of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana FT</italic> (<italic>AtFT</italic>) in squash/pumpkin (<italic>Cucurbita moschata</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, cotton leaf crumple virus was used for <italic>AtFT</italic> expression in cotton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and citrus leaf blotch virus was used for <italic>AtFT</italic> or citrus <italic>FT</italic> expression in citrus plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> for the successful induction of early flowering. As apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) exhibits a relatively wide host range, in previous studies we used an ALSV vector for the expression of <italic>AtFT</italic> or other <italic>FT</italic> genes such as a gentian <italic>FT</italic> to induce early flowering in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana</italic>) plants, soybean, apple, petunia, lisianthus (eustoma) and gentian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The progeny plants of cross-bred gentian generated by using ALSV-based VIF were confirmed for elimination of the virus, cleared governmental review and started to be grown in an open field in Hachimantai City of Japan for selection of a new cultivar. This appears to be the first example of the application of any New Plant Breeding Technique in Japan.</p><p id="Par9">Again, ALSV enjoys advantages as a virus vector: ALSV has a wide host range, latently infects most plant species (without viral symptoms) and evenly infects the upper leaves. ALSV may provide novel high-throughput methods for estimation of the functions of strawberry genes, and promotion of cross-breeding by shortening the generation time of strawberry. To examine the utility of this technique, in the present study we inoculated ALSV vectors to a commercially important cultivar of strawberry. As a result, the abilities of the ALSV vector to successfully infect strawberry seedlings and to spread to every organ of the shoot, as well as to induce VIGS and VIF in strawberry plants, were ascertained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Conditions of ALSV inoculation</title><p id="Par10">As ALSV vectors have not yet been tested in strawberry, we first aimed to identify a successful condition of ALSV inoculation to strawberry.

As a similar trend of difference in infection rate was also observed in ALSV infection to grapevine (Maeda et al., unpublished data), a general difference in physiological states between soil-cultivated plants and tissue-cultured plants may exist that renders in vitro plants more susceptible to viral infection. Namai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> reported that the resistance to anthracnose of tissue-cultured strawberry plants increased as the acclimation period increased, suggesting that the resistance of a strawberry cultivar may be induced by external factors. Considering that plants are equipped with molecular defense systems against virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, possible environmental effects on these defense systems, such as RNA silencing mechanism, should be examined in future studies.</p><p id="Par18">The infection rate of ALSV-FaPDS to seedlings grown in vitro was 100%, a similar rate as obtained with wtALSV. Conversely, infection rate of ALSV-AtFT in in vitro strawberry was only 58% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Such variation in infection rate of ALSV has been repeatedly observed in many plant species. The infection rate of ALSV is affected (lowered) according to the size and nucleotide sequence of the insertion. However, insertions of 201&#x02009;nt rarely affect infection rate. The infection rate of ALSV-AtFT is expected to be sufficiently high for basic studies and applications in strawberry. Moreover, in addition to strawberry seedling (&#x02018;Yotsuboshi&#x02019;), successful infection of ALSV vectors was also achieved in strawberry cultivar (&#x02018;Dover&#x02019;) propagated from in vitro culture (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This suggests that ALSV technology might be applied to the analysis of gene function and promotion of flowering in the majority of strawberry cultivars.</p><p id="Par19">Photo-bleaching in whole leaves, petioles and stems in the upper part of vegetative organs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) indicated ALSV penetration throughout the upper portions of vegetative organs. In addition, systemic infection of wtALSV did not cause viral symptoms in strawberry. These results are consistent with our previous experiments in other plant species such as apple, gentian, soybean and tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, analysis of ALSV infection in reproductive organs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) demonstrated that ALSV could be detected in many parts of pollen grains and ovules, as well as in ovaries, receptacles, petals and sepals, indicating that ALSV also penetrated reproductive organs.</p><p id="Par20">As described in the Introduction, TRV vector is already reported to induce gene silencing as the sections within strawberry fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The advantages of TRV compared with ALSV are that the experimental procedure is quite simple, and it can be used for VIGS study in strawberry fruits. On the other hand, the advantages of ALSV would be that ALSV can be used for gene silencing in whole vegetative tissues (leaves and stems) of strawberry shoot: ALSV induces even (overall) gene silencing in stems and &#x02018;remote&#x02019; upper leaves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It is not examined yet whether ALSV is applicable to VIGS in strawberry fruits, although there will be a good chance to induce even gene silencing in vegetative tissues. What is more, ALSV can induce VIF to shorten the generation time of strawberry. In practical use of ALSV for VIF of strawberry, normally grown cultivars will be crossed with each other. The F<sub>1</sub> seeds are gathered, aseptically cultured, and inoculated with ALSV to induce early flowering for estimation of fruit quality or further crossing. After elimination of ALSV, this virus will no longer affect flowering pattern or vegetative growth (plant size).</p><p id="Par21">ALSV should preferably be removed in the next generation, when early flowering (VIF) technology is utilized for the promotion of cross-breeding. In this sense, VIF with ALSV vectors is especially convenient in gentian and lisianthus, in which ALSV is not transmitted to the next generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In the case of apple, ALSV is transferred from the seed parent to progeny plants at a low rate (0&#x02013;4.5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, when we examined strawberry plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), ALSV was never transferred to the next generation, suggesting that ALSV infecting pollen grains and ovules becomes degraded in strawberry embryos after pollination.</p><p id="Par22">Shorter generation time is also advantageous for the generation of hybrid strawberry cultivars. Compared with traditional vegetative propagation using runners, seed-propagated characteristics are expected to ease the labour required for preparing new seedlings. To develop new hybrid cultivars, genomes of both parents are fixed to homozygotes through repetitive self-pollinations. After breeding of strawberry cultivars by using VIF technology, the absence of ALSV in progeny plants are ascertained by methods like RT-LAMP, before they are taken to open fields. Notably, such strawberry plants are not transgenic at least on the product base<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, because ALSV, an RNA virus, only transiently infects strawberry cells.
