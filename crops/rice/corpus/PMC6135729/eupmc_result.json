    "<label>BACKGROUND</label>Complex co-regulatory networks in plants may elicit responses during pathogen infections. A number of genes are activated when these responses take place. Identification of these genes would shed new light on understanding the mechanisms of rice response to pathogen infections and the elucidation of crosstalk among diverse signaling networks in rice disease resistance/susceptibility.<label>RESULTS</label>Here we report the identification of genes with pathogen-inducible cis-regulatory elements (PICEs) (AS-1, G-box, GCC-box, and H-box) in the promoter regions in rice. Our results showed that a set of 882 rice genes contained these four elements in their promoter regions. Of these genes, 190 encode disease resistance/susceptibility related proteins, and 70 encode transcription factors. Analyses of the available microarray data demonstrated that 357 transcripts were differentially expressed after pathogen infections. 48 out of 53 differentially expressed transcription factors are up-regulated or down-regulated by more than 1.1-fold in response to pathogen infections. Analyses of the public mRNA-Seq data showed that 327 transcripts were differently expressed after pathogen infections. A total of 100 up-regulated genes and 37 down-regulated genes were found in common between the microarray and mRNA-Seq data.<label>CONCLUSIONS</label>We report here a set of rice genes that contain the four PICEs, i.e., AS-1, G-box, GCC-box, and H-box, in their promoter regions, of which, 53.5% were up- or down-regulated when pathogens attack. The PICEs in the gene promoters are critical for rice response to pathogen infections. They are also useful markers for identification of rice genes involved in response to pathogen infections."
