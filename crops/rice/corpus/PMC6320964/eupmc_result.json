    "Bachu (Chinese cabbage) kimchi, a Korean traditional fermented dish, were prepared with or without the addition of glutinous (waxy) rice paste and their characteristics including pH, total bacteria count, total starch content, sugar metabolites, and molecular structure of starch were examined periodically for 20 days to investigate the effect of adding glutinous rice paste to kimchi during fermentation. The pH and total bacteria count showed that the fermentation of kimchi added with glutinous rice paste (GRP kimchi) progressed a little more quickly than that of control kimchi without glutinous rice paste. The GRP kimchi had higher glucose content but lower fructose content than control kimchi. Interestingly, maltose was only detected in GRP kimchi during fermentation. The GRP kimchi contained much greater amount of mannitol throughout fermentation than control kimchi. Total starch content in GRP kimchi gradually decreased during fermentation, which might have contributed to its greater glucose content and the larger amount of maltose production. In GRP kimchi, peak height and area for all degrees of polymerization (DP) of starch decreased during fermentation and its average chain length decreased while the proportion of short chains increased as fermentation processed, indicating degradation of starch chains by enzymes presented in the kimchi."
