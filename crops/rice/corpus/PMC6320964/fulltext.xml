Introduction</title><p>Kimchi, a Korean traditional fermented essential side dish for meals, is made through fermentation of vegetables such as Chinese cabbage (<italic>Baechu</italic>) and radish (<italic>Mu</italic>) [<xref rid="B1-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Kimchi is classified into hundreds of varieties, depending on the types of vegetable used, region, and preparation methods [<xref rid="B2-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among them, <italic>baechu</italic> kimchi is currently the most popular and commonly used kimchi in Korea. <italic>Baechu</italic> kimchi is generally made by cabbage with various seasonings and additives such as red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, green onion, fermented seafood, and salts. Kimchi products are very spicy with sour, sweet, and carbonated tastes [<xref rid="B2-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recently, kimchi has become a globally popular food due to its health-promoting effects including anticancer, antioxidative, antidiabetic and antiobesity effects [<xref rid="B3-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These physiological effects originate from bioactive compounds present in various ingredients in kimchi, which are amplified during fermentation process [<xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Spontaneous fermentation environment in kimchi could lead to the growth of various microorganisms [<xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Main microbial communities in kimchi are lactic acid bacteria (LAB) including <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Leuconostoc</italic>, <italic>Weissella</italic>, <italic>Lactococcus</italic>, and <italic>Pediococcus</italic> species [<xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some kimchi LAB are considered probiotic strains, which are basically live microorganism that confer health-promoting benefits to hosts by improving the intestinal microbial balance [<xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Kimchi LAB are most prominent probiotics which have been receiving a tremendous attention from research field to prevent various diseases or disorders because they have been used as antibacterial, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiobesity, and antioxidant [<xref rid="B9-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These microbial groups also contribute considerably to the safety, shelf-life, and organoleptic or nutritional properties of kimchi [<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, eating kimchi is a good way to include more vegetables and probiotics in the diet to improve health [<xref rid="B7-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The quality of kimchi mainly depends on the ingredients used, processing methods, and fermentation conditions including temperature, period, and number and type of microorganisms [<xref rid="B12-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, proper addition of minor ingredients could produce delicious and palatable kimchi [<xref rid="B2-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The glutinous rice paste, which is made by cooking (gelatinizing) glutinous rice flour with water, was usually added in traditional kimchi preparation in order to improve its taste and flavor, and give it viscosity [<xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Glutinous rice, also called waxy or sweet rice, is characterized mainly by its low amylose in the starch and has found extensive use in Korean traditional foods due to its sticky and soft texture after cooking [<xref rid="B14-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are a few existing reports regarding the effect of glutinous rice paste on kimchi fermentation [<xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lee and Han [<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that the addition of glutinous rice paste to kimchi preparation could remove the off-flavor related to vegetables and improve the texture. Glutinous rice paste in kimchi can also change total acidity and reducing sugar content by affecting the growth of LAB [<xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Park [<xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] suggested that the glutinous rice paste in kimchi accelerated the fermentation process with results of pH, titratable acidity, and reducing sugar content. However, until now, a rational approach to the effect of adding glutinous rice paste during kimchi fermentation process has not been established, which makes it difficult to explain the use of glutinous rice paste in kimchi industry.</p><p>The kimchi LAB that arise from the fermentation of kimchi contributes significantly to the metabolites of kimchi products [<xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Various metabolites such as free sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose), organic acids (lactic and acetic acids), and other flavoring components (mannitol and amino acids) are produced during the entire kimchi fermentation process. These metabolites could be important factors for determining the taste and flavor of kimchi [<xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For determination of metabolites, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have been used [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since glutinous rice flour consists of about 90% starch, it may exert several effects on sugar metabolites during kimchi fermentation by its degradation to small size of glucan. However, the effects of glutinous rice paste on metabolites during kimchi fermentation and the information in degradation feature of starch in added glutinous rice have not yet been explored. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to: (1) identify and quantify sugar-related metabolite changes in kimchi by adding glutinous rice paste during fermentation; and (2) understand structural features of starch in glutinous rice paste during fermentation. The acquired new knowledge in this study will answer the critical research question for using glutinous rice paste in kimchi industry.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-23-03324"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-23-03324"><title>2.1. pH of Kimchi during Fermentation</title><p>The pH over 20 days of fermentation with or without the addition of glutinous rice paste (GRP) to kimchi were monitored and results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The initial pH of kimchi sample with or without GRP was around 5.50. The pH of kimchi supernatant increased marginally in control kimchi or remained constant in GRP kimchi during the early stage of fermentation (0.5 day) and thereafter it substantially decreased. After 1 day of fermentation, the pH value became stable regardless of the addition of GRP and it reached approximately 3.96&#x02013;4.13. Jung et al. [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] claimed that the slight increase in pH during early kimchi fermentation could be due to the released saps from various vegetables since the pH of salted cabbage (5.1) was much lower than that of seasoning (5.6) including various vegetables as reported by Yun et al. [<xref rid="B19-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The rapid decrease in pH could be attributed to the formation of organic acids from the degradation of sugars by LABs during fermentation [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similar pH profile in kimchi fermentation has been reported by Jung et al. [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Lee and Han [<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During 20 days of fermentation, pH values of GRP kimchi (4.24 and 4.13 after 7 and 20 days, respectively) were slightly lower than those of control kimchi (4.00 and 3.96 after 7 and 20 days, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). This result is in accordance with that of Jang and Park [<xref rid="B13-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] on leek kimchi and Lee and Han [<xref rid="B15-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] on cabbage kimchi, who reported that the addition of glutinous rice paste to kimchi resulted in decrease in pH. Therefore, the addition of glutinous rice paste to kimchi preparation could cause rapid acceleration of the fermentation process by making LABs become predominant microorganisms due to higher amount of glucose available for producing more lactic acid, thus reducing the pH [<xref rid="B17-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-23-03324"><title>2.2. Count of Microorganisms during Fermentation</title><p>Total bacteria count of in kimchi samples during fermentation was highly influenced by the presence of glutinous rice paste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The microbial population increased in the early stage of fermentation and then decreased. Similar result was observed by Lee and Han [<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who suggested that the rapid increase in microbial population could be due to the increased number of LABs during spontaneous fermentation since the pattern of changes between total bacterial count and lactic acid bacteria in kimchi samples during the fermentation periods was largely similar. Cho et al. [<xref rid="B4-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found that all isolates in kimchi samples belonged to a subset of lactic acid bacteria among the total of 15 species. Zabat et al. [<xref rid="B20-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also reported that the bacterial community of kimchi was dominated by species of lactic acid bacteria. The decrease in total bacteria count at late stage of fermentation could be attributed to the limitation of growth in microorganisms due to large amounts of organic acids [<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The increase in total bacteria count inversely correlated with the decrease in pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The initial count of total bacteria was higher in control kimchi than that in GRP kimchi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). However, after 1 day of fermentation, GRP kimchi had higher cell count than control kimchi. Final total bacteria count in GRP kimchi reached 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, which was lower than that of control kimchi without addition of glutinous rice paste. Similarly, Lee and Han [<xref rid="B16-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that even though the initial bacteria count was slightly higher in control kimchi than that in kimchi added with glutinous rice paste or wheat flour paste, the total count of bacteria and LABs of kimchi added with rice paste was much higher than that in control kimchi along with rapid decrease in pH, suggesting that the addition of glutinous rice paste or wheat flour paste could induce rapid increase in LAB population.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-23-03324"><title>2.3. Total Starch Content in Kimchi during Fermentation</title><p>Total starch contents of kimchi decreased during fermentation over 20 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Since control kimchi had no addition of glutinous rice paste containing starch, starch was not detected in its sample. The initial total starch content in GRP kimchi samples was 12.9%, which marginally changed to 12.8% during half day of fermentation. Total starch content then decreased substantially to 7.4% after 1 day of fermentation and thereafter it decreased gradually to 3.5%. Interestingly, the decrease in total starch content was positively correlated with the decrease in pH. Hahn et al. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that amylolytic enzymes including &#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and glucoamylase contained in some basic components in kimchi (cabbage or radish) were activated during the fermentation process. The decrease in total starch content implies that activated carbohydrate enzymes might have caused the degradation of starch, leading to the release of low molecule sugars. Simultaneously, low molecular size of sugar might have been degraded to organic acid at the early stage of fermentation, resulting in a rapid drop of pH as well as increase in total bacteria count. Therefore, glutinous rice paste in kimchi could be directly converted to low molecular products by affecting pH and microorganism population, thus influencing the overall taste of kimchi. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-23-03324"><title>2.4. Sugars and Sugar Alcohols in Kimchi during Fermentation</title><p>Kimchi metabolites including free sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, and organic acids can highly influence kimchi organoleptic properties. The production of these kimchi metabolites can be significantly affected by the microorganism community during fermentation [<xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Glucose and fructose are major free sugars found in kimchi and are known to play important roles as carbon sources for LAB growth during fermentation. Levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose during fermentation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;D. Contents of glucose and fructose in kimchi samples rapidly decreased at the early stage of fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Similar results have been reported by several studies [<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B22-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These decreases in glucose and fructose levels could be attributed to the consumption of free sugars as energy source for rapid growth of microorganisms and correlated well with the decrease in pH and the increase in bacterial counts. Interestingly, glucose content in GRP kimchi increased quickly at the beginning of fermentation. This increase in glucose content could be most likely due to hydrolysis of maltose liberated from starch in the glutinous rice paste. These free sugar concentrations maintained at relatively constant levels after 2 days (for glucose content) or 5 days (for fructose content) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B) since the kimchi fermentation by LAB almost completed with supporting by the relatively constant pH. Interestingly, glucose content in GRP kimchi reached the minimum after 2 days and increased continuously but slowly thereafter. The glucose content in GRP kimchi reached 877 mg/100 g after 20 days of fermentation, which was twice higher than that in control kimchi (451 mg/100 g). The increase in glucose content during late fermentation period has not been reported by previous studies since glucose is used as the energy source for microorganisms. This result indicated that the production of glucose by hydrolysis of starch continually progressed, while kimchi fermentation by LAB almost completed around 5 days. On the contrary, fructose content in control kimchi was higher than that in GRP kimchi after 1 day to 20 days of fermentation. This result could be attributed to the greater consumption as carbon source of fructose in GRP kimchi, which was evidenced by its profound increase in bacterial abundance. Another possible explanation could be related to more transformation from fructose to other metabolites since it has been reported that fructose could be converted to lactate, acetate, mannitol, glycerol, or ethanol during fermentation of kimchi [<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. </p><p>Sucrose level in kimchi without or with glutinous rice paste also substantially decreased during fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). This decrease could be caused by its hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and the rapid uptake of LAB [<xref rid="B24-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. After 2 days of fermentation, sucrose almost hydrolyzed and its content maintained relatively constant. Sugar content in control kimchi was higher than that in GRP kimchi during the early fermentation period. However, after 2 days of fermentation, sucrose content was slightly higher in GRP kimchi than that in control kimchi. This difference could be related to diverse in environmental conditions for microorganism growth induced by added glutinous rice paste.</p><p>Major sugars detected in GRP kimchi also included maltose, which was different from previous reports [<xref rid="B5-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showing that maltose was not detected during fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Control kimchi had only 17 mg/100 g in maltose content before fermentation, but maltose was not detected after starting fermentation by complete hydrolysis to glucose. The level of maltose in GRP kimchi increased quickly at the beginning of fermentation. This increase could be attributed to hydrolysis of maltose to glucose and the production of maltose from starch by amylolytic enzymes that occurred concurrently. However, the amount of liberation of maltose from starch was much greater than its conversion to glucose. After the level of maltose reached its maximum, its content decreased rapidly and continually throughout 20 days of fermentation, a finding that correlated well with the decrease in total starch content. The decrease in maltose content could be responsible for the increase in glucose content occurring between 2 days and 20 days of fermentation in GRP kimchi. These results suggest that the added glutinous rice paste to kimchi could influence these metabolite changes with evident differences in glucose, fructose, and maltose contents during fermentation compared to control kimchi.</p><p>Sorbitol and mannitol, which influence to taste and flavor, were also detected in metabolites of kimchi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). Sorbitol was detected in a small quantity and its level marginally changed during fermentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). The level of sorbitol in control kimchi was slightly higher than that in GRP kimchi. Mannitol is known as a diabetic sugar alcohol with non-cariogenic properties that imparts the cooling and refreshing taste of food [<xref rid="B25-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mannitol content rapidly increased during the early stage of fermentation and its content maintained relatively constant after 5 days of fermentation, which was correlated inversely with decrease in fructose content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). Grobben et al. [<xref rid="B26-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] suggested that <italic>Leuconostoc mesenteroids</italic> could produce mannitol by consuming fructose with mannitol dehydrogenase. Jeong et al. [<xref rid="B10-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] also reported that two <italic>Leuconostoc</italic> strains were identified as mannitol-producing bacteria. Interestingly, in the present study, GRP kimchi had much higher mannitol level during fermentation than control kimchi, a finding that was supported by its greater decrease in fructose content. Since the production of mannitol in kimchi has been considered as a positive feature, the addition of glutinous rice paste to kimchi could be suggested to producers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-23-03324"><title>2.5. Structural Analysis of Starch in Kimchi during Fermentation</title><p>Starch is a main component of the added glutinous rice paste to kimchi and it mainly consists of essentially linear amylose and highly branched amylopectin with a degree of polymerization (DP) ranging from 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> to 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> [<xref rid="B27-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Amylopectin is the major fractions, account to more than 98% in waxy rice [<xref rid="B28-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, structural changes of starch in kimchi with glutinous (waxy) rice paste during fermentation were determined by chain length distribution of amylopectin. HPAEC-PAD chromatograms of starch are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f004">Figure 4</xref>A. HPAEC system used in this study could detect glucans with DP up to 83. Groups with DP 6&#x02013;30 showed higher normalized peak area in chromatograms, meaning major DPs in amylopectin of starch. HPAEC-PAD chromatogram could be grouped into the following chain types with applicable DP as A chains (DP 6&#x02013;12), B1 chains (DP 13&#x02013;24), B2 chains (DP 25&#x02013;36), and B3+ chains (DP &#x02265; 37) [<xref rid="B29-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The levels of amylopectin unit chains determined by the area ratio between starch from fermented kimchi and intact rice starch are grouped into different chain types and results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f004">Figure 4</xref>B. Interestingly, the chain types substantially decreased during fermentation period, suggesting that, during fermentation of kimchi, the added starch was metabolized substantially with evident decrease in total starch content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-23-03324-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This result seems to reflect multiple attacks by the action of mixed enzymes in relation to the degradation of amylopectin. Similarly, Hahn et al. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that amylolytic enzymes (&#x003b1;-amylase, &#x003b2;-amylase, and glucoamylase), which could degrade &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;4)- and &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;6)-starch chains, were activated during kimchi fermentation. Hu et al. [<xref rid="B30-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] suggested that LAB could metabolize isomalto-oligosaccharides with higher DP by cleaving &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;4)- and &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;6)-linkages.</p><p>HPAEC-PAD chromatogram was normalized by considering each peak area from total peak areas. Peak area ratios of different chain types reflecting structures of the residual amylopectin after fermentation are summarized in <xref rid="molecules-23-03324-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The chain length distribution of the residual amylopectin highly changed during the fermentation of kimchi. Interestingly, the proportion of short chains of DP 6&#x02013;12 significantly increased during fermentation, reaching around 50% after 5 days fermentation. On the contrary, the proportion of long chains (DP &#x02265; 37) proportionally decreased to around 2.0% with increase in fermentation period. The proportion of DP 13&#x02013;24 slightly decreased after 2 days of fermentation and then it increased. The proportion of DP 25&#x02013;26 remained relatively constant during 2 days of fermentation and thereafter it relatively decreased. These results indicate that amylolytic enzymes in kimchi excreted from ingredients or microorganisms during fermentation can trim chains of amylopectin in a uniform way, which is typical for amylase with multiple attack action [<xref rid="B31-molecules-23-03324" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This multiple attack action occurred by the amylolytic enzymes could contribute to decreasing the proportion of long chains and thus increasing the proportion of short chains. Short chains (DP 6&#x02013;12) could induce weak points in the amylopectin structure, thus causing greater susceptibility to enzymatic attack. Amylolytic enzymes could easily degrade these short chains (DP 6&#x02013;12) to predominately maltose. As evidenced by the data of amylopectin chain length distribution of residue after fermentation, multiple attack action of enzymes present in kimchi could degrade the cluster structure of amylopectin, producing greater amount of short chains and thus decreasing the average chain length.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-23-03324"><title>3.

Briefly, Chinese cabbage (73.5%) was steeped in 10% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) salt solution for 16 h. The steeped cabbage was washed with tap water three times and drained excess water. A seasoning mixture was prepared by mixing radishes (12.5%), Korean leek (0.5%), red pepper powder (3.0%), garlic (2.0%), ginger (0.5%), green onions (1.0%), anchovy sauce (0.5%), shrimp paste (1.5%), sugar (1.0%) and sea tangle base (4.0%). The seasoning mixture was added to the salted Chinese cabbage.

Conclusions</title><p>The effect of adding glutinous rice paste to kimchi during fermentation on the starch structure and sugar-related metabolites was determined in this study. This study clearly showed that the addition of glutinous rice paste to kimchi resulted in the acceleration of kimchi fermentation process and produced greater amount of glucose, maltose, and mannitol by degradation of rice starch in GRP. The amylopectin structure in added glutinous rice paste substantially changed during fermentation with respect to decrease in average chain length but increase in proportion of short chains by degrading starch chains to a large extent. Our results could provide useful information of relationships between the addition of glutinous rice paste and metabolite change in kimchi fermentation, which could be very valuable for kimchi industries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of the compounds are not available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>H.C. conceived the study and designed the experiments.
