Here we have used a first-generation wheat haplotype map created by targeted re-sequencing of low-copy genomic regions in the reference panel of 62 lines to impute marker genotypes in a diverse panel of winter wheat cultivars from the U.S. Great Plains. The IBD segments between the reference population and winter wheat cultivars were identified based on SNP genotyped using the 90K iSelect wheat array and genotyping by sequencing (GBS). A genome-wide association study and genomic prediction of resistance to stripe rust in winter wheat cultivars showed that an increase in marker density achieved by imputation improved both the power and precision of trait mapping and prediction. The majority of the most significant marker-trait associations belonged to imputed genotypes. With the vast amount of SNP variation data accumulated for wheat in recent years, the presented imputation framework will greatly improve prediction accuracy in breeding populations and increase resolution of trait mapping hence, facilitate cross-referencing of genotype datasets available across different wheat populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Wheat HapMap</kwd><kwd>SNP</kwd><kwd>Imputation</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>Genomic Prediction</kwd><kwd>GenPred</kwd><kwd>Shared Data Resources</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Chromosomal segments sharing common ancestry in a population, referred to as segments of identity-by-descent (IBD), may be detected using high-density marker data and this information may be used for predicting unobserved genotypes for markers located in the same IBD segment (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Browning and Browning 2012</xref>). This genotype imputation procedure allows the interpolation of diversity data across diverged populations genotyped using common marker platforms. The imputed genotypes increase the number of SNP available for marker-trait association analyses and genomic prediction, thus increasing the resolution and power of association mapping studies and model-based predictions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Howie <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crossa <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In humans and maize (Abecasis <italic>et al.</italic> 2010; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Swarts <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), the accuracy of imputation correlated with the frequency of imputed alleles in a population. It was shown that by increasing the genotyping probability (GP) cutoff value, the accuracy of imputation can be increased at the cost of increasing the proportion of missing genotypes in the final dataset. Genotype imputation performed using the 1,000 human genomes dataset made it possible to test the majority of common variants in a population for marker-phenotype associations (Abecasis <italic>et al.</italic> 2010). It was demonstrated that more complete ascertainment of SNP variation achieved by imputation helped to identify previously unidentified candidate SNP (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Similarly, imputation performed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> using the whole-genome sequence data generated from a reference panel of 80 strains (accessions) increased the power and resolution of trait mapping in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cao <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In maize, GBS markers were effectively used to detect the IBD regions in a diverse panel of lines and to predict missing genotypes present at high frequency in this type of genotyping data (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Swarts <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, the complexity of the wheat genome was one of the main obstacles for obtaining high-density genetic variation data. As a result, many wheat scientists have relied on low-density PCR-based markers for disease diagnosis and marker assisted selection (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Helguera <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ullah <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Several PCR-based markers such as S19M93, S23M41, <italic>Xpsp</italic>3000, Iag95 and VENTRIUP-LN2 are commonly used in screening of wheat lines for stripe rust resistance (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ullah <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). However, the development of genotyping arrays (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cavanagh <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014b</xref>) and next-generation sequencing-based methods of genotyping (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Saintenac <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Poland <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; Saintenac, Zhang, <italic>et al.</italic> 2013; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) has enabled the generation of SNP markers covering the entire wheat genome. Large populations of diverse lines and recombinant inbred wheat lines have been genotyped using the 9K and 90K SNP arrays, and used for mapping a number of traits related to disease resistance (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sela <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Maccaferri <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), yield (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kalous <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), height (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Zanke <italic>et al.</italic> 2014a</xref>), heading date (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Zanke <italic>et al.</italic> 2014b</xref>), and domestication (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Faris <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). The GBS method has become the technology of choice for cost-effective genotyping and trait mapping (Saintenac, Jiang, <italic>et al.</italic> 2013; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Crespo-Herrera <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). While GBS is characterized with high missing genotype data, imputations approaches have enabled the use of these markers for genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies in various species including wheat (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Crossa <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Finally, a high-density haplotype map of wheat was generated using the whole exome capture and GBS, which provided a detailed description of the majority of common variants in the genic regions of the wheat genome at the sequence level (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>).</p><p>With the development of a first genomic reference sequence (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2014</xref>) it has become possible to use the wheat SNP variation maps for IBD prediction and imputing missing genotypes in diverse collections of lines. Here, a first-generation wheat SNP haplotype map was used to develop a resource for imputing marker genotypes in populations previously genotyped using either the 90K SNP iSelect wheat array (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014b</xref>) or GBS (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Poland <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The utility of GBS and 90K SNP datasets for imputing ungenotyped markers was assessed. We used SNP genotyped by exome capture in the reference panel of 62 wheat lines (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) to impute ungenotyped markers in a diverse collection of winter wheat cultivars from the U.S. Great Plains. It was demonstrated that SNP from the reference panel can be accurately imputed into the winter wheat population, significantly increasing marker density to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction and the number of detected marker-trait associations in GWAS.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Diversity panel and genotyping</title><p>The association mapping panel of hard red winter wheat cultivars (henceforth, WWAM panel) included 307 accessions from major breeding programs across the U.S. Great Plains (Table S1). The WWAM panel was genotyped using the custom 90K SNP iSelect wheat array and GBS according to Saintenac <italic>et al.</italic> (2013). The GBS data were generated for the WWAM panel by sequencing the barcoded 96-plex libraries on a single lane of HiSeq2500 instrument. Raw GBS reads of 100 bp in length were trimmed to remove low quality bases (quality &#x0003c; 15) from both ends retaining only reads of &#x0003e; 30 bp. A filter was applied to select reads with at least 80% of bases having quality &#x0003e;15. Reads passing the quality control steps were separated based on the barcode sequences corresponding to individual accessions. GBS data were aligned to the assemblies of the wheat flow-sorted chromosomes (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2014</xref>) using a previously described mapping strategy (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In brief, the strategy uses the Bowtie program (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg 2012</xref>) with three sets of alignment parameters with decreasing mapping stringency. Reads not aligned at higher stringency levels were re-used at lower stringency levels.</p><p>The read alignment files generated for each accession were sorted and indexed using SAMtools (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) prior to variant calling.

These data were used to generate random samples with different proportions of missing genotypes. A total of 10 datasets for each level of missing data were generated. The imputed genotypes were then compared to the original genotypes to calculate the accuracy of imputation.</p><p>For imputing missing SNP sites in the WWAM panel that were genotyped in the reference panel of 62 wheat lines, we used three sets of SNP markers: 1) markers genotyped using the 90K SNP iSelect array, 2) GBS markers, and 3) combined 90K SNP iSelect and GBS markers. A total of 9,786, 4,876, and 14,662 markers overlapping between the target WWAM population and the reference panel were selected from each of these three datasets, respectively. These sets of markers for imputation using the 62 accessions reference panel are available for download from the wheat HapMap project page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/">http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/</ext-link>).</p><p>The program Beagle v4.0 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Browning and Browning 2013</xref>) was used to impute missing and ungenotyped SNP markers in the target population of winter wheat cultivars using exome capture SNP from the reference panel of 62 wheat lines. The imputation parameters included &#x0201c;nthreads=10 burnin-its=10 phase-its=10 window=5000 overlap=500&#x0201d;, as previously described by <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> (2015)</xref>. The imputed files were filtered using customizable cut-off values of genotyping probability (GP; default value = 0.8), proportion of missing genotypes (default value = 0.5) and minor allele frequency (MAF; default value = 0.03). SNP genotyped using the 90K iSelect wheat array or GBS or both were used for detecting the IBD regions between the reference and target population.</p><p>To facilitate imputation, we have developed a set of scripts for formatting 90K and GBS genotype data generated for any target population. The imputation workflow is shown on Fig. S1 and scripts can be downloaded from the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/">http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/</ext-link>. The input files can be provided in either the VCF (Variant Call Format) or hapmap format. Perl scripts were developed to transform data from the hapmap to the VCF format used by Beagle v4.0. These scripts and some example data to test-run the scripts can also be downloaded from GitHub website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wheatgenomics/haplotypeV1_imputation">https://github.com/wheatgenomics/haplotypeV1_imputation</ext-link>. Currently, the input SNP should have the coordinates based on the wheat flow-sorted chromosome survey sequencing (CSS) contigs (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2014</xref>). However, to facilitate the imputation of SNP generated based on the new version of wheat reference sequence (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium 2018</xref>), we updated the SNP positions for the reference panel. This was achieved using Perl scripts and SAMtools to extract 50 bp of sequences flanking the SNP on both sides from the contigs of CSS. For SNP that were located at less than 50 bp from the start of the contig, the start position of the flanking sequence was adjusted to one. The extracted sequences were aligned to the CS reference using blastn. The blastn output file was filtered on percent identity, e-value, mismatches and unique alignment using a Perl script. Only sequences that had 100% identity with the reference, without any mismatch, evalue &#x02265; 3.45e-45 and had only one hit in the entire reference sequence were retained. SNP positions were then calculated by subtracting 50 from end position of the sequence alignment. The new ordering was then linked to the vcf files containing the reference panel SNP using a Perl script. These updated SNP can be accessed from the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/">http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/</ext-link>.</p><p>The DNA strand designation and orientation of allele calls provided for the target population were compared with that of the reference population. Allele designation and reference allele frequency were used to determine whether the target and reference chromosome strands were identical or not. In case there was no match between the reference and target population, the designation and orientation of alleles were corrected. A Perl script was developed to check the consistency between the target and reference VCF files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/">http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/hapmap/</ext-link>).

Approximately 30 seeds were sown per 2 m rows spaced 25 cm apart.

Significant genomic intervals were defined based on the LD blocks around the most strongly associated alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Table S4) and were tested for overlap with previously mapped stripe rust resistance loci. We used the 90K consensus genetic map (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014b</xref>) to define intervals harboring GWAS signals considering that LD in the HRWW population decays to <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.3, approximately to half of its initial value, at about 2 cM (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chao <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>).

In addition, the Ventriup marker linked with the <italic>Yr17</italic> stripe rust resistance gene was used in marker-trait association analysis. The <italic>Yr17</italic> gene is located on chromosome 2AS and was present in cultivar Jagger, one of the historic cultivars from Kansas broadly used in the breeding programs across the U.S. Great Plains.

The slight reduction in the number of SNP was due to removal of loci where the minor and major alleles could not be determined. Including all imputed SNP in set 2 did not show improvement in prediction accuracy of stripe rust resistance as compared to including only imputed SNP that had a p-value &#x02264; 0.05 as informed by GWAS. We hypothesized that majority of the imputed SNP were not linked to QTL controlling stripe rust resistance and their minor allele frequency varied greatly causing background noise given the diverse nature of the WWAM panel. The selected imputed SNP were distributed across all chromosomes of the CSS reference. The number of SNP in set 1 and set 2 was 30,797 and 38,123, respectively. The phenotype data used for genomic prediction included mean and BLUP values of cultivars for infection type and severity. For seedling resistance, original observations were used because it was measured once in the green house. Predictions based on BLUPs were slightly better than those based on the mean values of infection type and severity. The gain in prediction accuracy of both BayesB and RKHS models using SNP set 2 was &#x0003e; 50% for infection type and severity relative to using SNP set 1 (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This significant gain in PA was attributed to the imputed SNP that increased the number of markers in the data set that were associated with the traits. Addition of imputed SNP to SNP set 1 did not improve the prediction of seedling resistance with both models suggesting that the SNP important for this trait were already present in set 1. BayesB and RKHS models performed equally well with predictions ranging from 0.331 to 0.582. Generally, these results suggest that imputation of missing SNP sites using the reference panel SNP has the potential to improve prediction accuracy but the increase depends on the trait architecture and the population under study.</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>BayesB and RKHS prediction of stripe rust resistance for WWAM panel using SNP markers genotyped using 90K iSelect array, GBS and selected imputed markers with p-value &#x02264;

In experimental crosses or breeding populations based on a limited number of founders, significant length of IBD segments and their high population frequency allows for IBD detection using relatively modest marker density. In diverse populations, including distantly related lines separated by a large number of meiotic recombination events, the short length of IBD segments requires high marker density for their effective detection. In this study we have demonstrated that accurate genotype imputation using the re-sequenced reference panel of 62 wheat lines (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) is feasible in a target population of wheat cultivars genotyped using the 90K SNP array or GBS. The imputation approach presented here can be applied to any wheat population previously genotyped using the 90K SNP iSelect array or GBS method. Our results showed that under a given imputation scenario the 90K SNP array dataset resulted in a higher fraction of imputed SNP than the GBS dataset. It is possible that the higher incidence of missing data in the GBS dataset and errors in mapping short reads to the complex wheat genome might have resulted in capturing a lower proportion of haplotype blocks in the WWAM panel compared to that captured by the 90K SNP iSelect array. Combining both GBS and 90K SNP resulted in a significant increase in the number of imputed genotypes, which increased the proportion of accurately predicted IBD segments. Improvements in the quality of the wheat genome reference sequence and increase in the accuracy of genotype calling from GBS data due to improvements in algorithms and increase in the depth of sequencing are expected to increase in the accuracy of IBD prediction and imputation. Further improvements can likely be achieved by using different imputations algorithms (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Whalen <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) or, for cases when large reference panels are available, by applying reference selection algorithms that were shown to improve the accuracy of imputation (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>).</p><p>The utility of genotype imputation using the reference panel of 62 wheat lines was further validated by performing association mapping and genomic prediction of stripe rust resistance in the winter wheat cultivars from the U.S. Great Plains.

Stronger associations of imputed markers with a trait have been previously shown in human and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mapping projects (Abecasis <italic>et al.</italic> 2010; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cao <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). A more complete ascertainment of SNP in the regions linked with a trait increases the probability of detecting variants located on the same haplotype as the causal SNP, which improves the power and precision of association mapping studies.</p><p>Similarly, improvement in the prediction accuracy of infection type and severity of stripe rust was attributed to increased number of SNP imputed in the WWAM panel. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Crossa <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> demonstrated the effect of increasing the number of SNP markers on the prediction accuracy of grain yield. However, several factors have been shown to affect the prediction accuracy of the models including genetic relatedness between the training and testing population, population size and genetic architecture of the trait (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bassi <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Spindel <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wientjes <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Our results suggest that selection of imputed markers based on their relative association with the trait reduced the noise of non-associated imputed markers leading to a great improvement in prediction accuracy of infection type and severity. <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> reported an improvement in whole genome prediction accuracy of complex traits by incorporating and giving markers weights that were associated with QTL based on previous GWAS results for the traits in dairy cattle and rice. However, they noted that the improvement in accuracy was dependent on the trait architecture. It was demonstrated in rice that for each trait there is a threshold on the number of markers required to achieve the highest prediction accuracy beyond which no gain is achieved by adding more markers (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Spindel <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Seedling resistance to stripe rust is known to be a monogenic trait (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aktar-Uz-Zaman <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). This could probably explain why there was no improvement in prediction accuracy by increasing the number of SNP in set 2. Infection type and severity are associated with adult plant resistance, which is polygenic in nature (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aktar-Uz-Zaman <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) hence, imputed SNP increased the chances of capturing most of the QTL linked to these traits. Indeed, BayesB model that accounts for additive genetic effect showed a slightly better prediction for the infection type and severity than seedling resistance as compared to RKHS model, which accounts for non-additive genetic effects (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e9;rez and de los Campos 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we have demonstrated that by transferring genetic information from a densely genotyped reference panel of 62 wheat lines, we can significantly improve the efficiency of GWAS and genomic prediction. While the reference panel represents haplotypes not directly related to the U.S. winter wheat cultivars, it appears that both reference and target populations still share a significant fraction of chromosomal regions that are IBD. This observation is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the low levels of genetic differentiation between global spring and winter wheat populations, and between populations of cultivars and landraces (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chao <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cavanagh <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). However, the lack of haplotypes representing the genetic diversity of U.S. winter wheat resulted in imputation of a smaller number of SNP in this study compared to that imputed in the population of spring wheat landraces (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). As suggested in a study based on the analysis of 1000 human genomes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Howie <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), inclusion of additional reference haplotypes capturing the diversity of local populations is needed to significantly increase the number of accurately imputed SNP.</p><p>The reference panel of diverse wheat lines genotyped by exome capture re-sequencing represents a valuable resource for wheat genetics and breeding studies by providing a platform that allows transferring genomic variation data across multiple populations to increase the power and precision of trait mapping. Genomic prediction informed by results of GWAS greatly increased the prediction accuracy of traits. The value of this resource may be further improved by increasing the number of re-sequenced lines selected to capture the haplotypic variation of global wheat populations. In the future, this expanded reference panel would allow for the strategic selection of re-sequenced lines for imputation based on the relevance to the population of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was supported by the National Research Initiative Competitive Grants 2017-67007-25939 (Wheat-CAP) and 2016-67013-24473 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant, and by Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Supplemental material available at Figshare: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.7294766">https://doi.org/10.25387/g3.7294766</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Communicating editor: D.
