In particular, archaea, the third domain of life, constitute a considerable fraction of the soil microbial community and its biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota (formerly described as mesophilic Crenarchaeota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) are two major archaeal phyla, and both were recently found to contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; for example, euryarchaeotal methanogenesis is typically considered the dominant process in anaerobic habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, the autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea, which belong to Thaumarchaeota, possess homologs of the alpha and beta subunits of the bacterial ammonia monooxygenase enzyme and predominate among ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes in soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ammonia oxidation is the first step in nitrification, a key process in the global nitrogen cycle that results in the formation of nitrate through microbial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Studies to date of terrestrial archaeal ecology have focused mainly on natural ecosystems, finding high variability in the general structure and relative abundance of soil archaeal communities along broad environmental gradients and among various habitat types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Agricultural fields are typical human-managed terrestrial ecosystems and are vital for securing a global food supply. Importantly, agricultural ecosystems can make substantial contributions to water and soil conservation, climate regulation, and atmospheric quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to long-term tillage and fertilization practices, soil physicochemical properties and ecosystem processes tend to diverge between agricultural and natural ecosystems, resulting in distinct microbial assembly patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, agricultural ecosystems are influenced by varying water management practices, such as occasional irrigation in maize fields (dryland) and continuous flooding in rice paddies (wetland). Given their pronounced difference in oxygenation levels, microbially mediated soil processes and ecological diversity patterns are also likely to be distinct between wetland and dryland soils. In addition, the emissions of greenhouse gases (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide) during rice cultivation are of great concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since soil archaea play important roles in ecosystem biogeochemical cycles, they are crucial for nutrient management, crop productivity, and climate regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the fundamental processes that underlie archaeal biogeographic and ecological diversity patterns in these two widely used yet distinctive agricultural ecosystems.</p><p id="Par6">Uncovering the spatial assembly of microbial communities remains a major challenge in microbial ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The focus of microbial biogeography is now turning towards the underlying processes in microbial assembly from an initial focus on the description of patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The recent literature has instilled a growing awareness that archaeal communities are affected by various soil and environmental factors, including soil pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], nutrient availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and spatial distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, because the available studies are confined to specific sites, it is difficult to obtain a systematic and detailed ecological understanding of archaeal community distributions in soils across large-scale regions. Unraveling the ecological attributes of particular dominant archaeal taxa could help us predict how soil archaeal communities shift spatially and temporally, as well as how agricultural ecosystems respond to current and future environmental changes. Recently, a global atlas of dominant soil bacteria was compiled, and a &#x0201c;most wanted&#x0201d; list of taxa was narrowed down to illustrate the spatial distribution of soil bacteria and their contribution to ecosystem functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Since microbial life-history depends on oxygen conditions&#x02014;archaea are mainly anaerobic whereas bacteria are mainly aerobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]&#x02014;the spatial distributions of soil archaea and bacteria may as well be very different. Yet, we currently lack a predictive ecological understanding of soil individual archaeal taxa and know little about their environmental preferences, traits, and metabolic capabilities. An outstanding issue is whether dominant archaeal communities can exist abundantly and ubiquitously in agricultural soils across distant sites. Resolving this critical issue would advance our understanding of soil archaeal communities.</p><p id="Par7">Maize and rice are two major crops widely cultivated across China, thus making them excellent models for assessing broad-scale questions about microbial diversity and assembly between dryland and wetland agricultural ecosystems. Here, we carried out a large-scale soil survey of archaeal communities in agricultural soils from adjacent pairs of maize and rice cultivated fields across eastern China, aimed at controlling for the influences of spatial scale and climatic factors on patterns of archaeal diversity. The objectives of the present study were (1) to explore the relative contributions of underlying factors to archaeal assembly, (2) to identify the dominant archaeal taxa and determine their habitat preferences and co-occurrence patterns, and (3) to construct a continental atlas of archaeal spatial distributions in wetland and dryland agricultural ecosystems. Our study suggests that the spatial distributions of the dominant archaeal taxa in agricultural ecosystems are predictable, which should improve our ability to manage soil archaeal communities to provide key ecosystem services and improve crop productivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">From all the 249 samples, we obtained a total of 18,105,503 high-quality sequences, which clustered into 3509 operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

While mean annual temperatures (MAT) and carbon-nitrogen ratios (C/N ratios) contributed the most towards explaining the variation in the Shannon index of maize fields, available iron (AFe) and MAT contributed most for rice fields.

Specifically, according to follow-up bivariate regressions, irrespective of the maize or rice, the relative abundance of Euryarchaeota increased significantly with greater NH<sub>4</sub> and AS levels in soil while that of Thaumarchaeota rose with NH<sub>4</sub>. Nonetheless, in rice fields only, significant and negative linear regressions were found between the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota and TS levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and d). Moreover, when we modeled the spatial distributions of these two phyla (using a kriging interpolation method), their predicted patterns showed that Euryarchaeota had a greater relative abundance in southern field than the northern counterpart, whereas this trend was reversed in Thaumarchaeota (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).

This amounted to 339 OTUs, accounting for 9.7% of all observed taxa. Nonetheless, on average, these dominant taxa accounted for 93.1% of the sequences. Given the distinct archaeal assembly patterns between maize and rice fields, we determined the ecological preferences of dominant archaeal taxa by focusing on whether they preferred a waterlogged environment. The dominant archaeal taxa were grouped into two ecological clusters sharing habitat preferences for (1) dryland and (2) paddy (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).</p><p id="Par16">We constructed spatial distribution maps of these two ecological clusters of dominant archaeal taxa, finding that the dryland cluster had a greater relative abundance in northern than southern counterparts for either maize or rice fields, whereas this trend was reversed in the paddy cluster (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).

In addition, dominant archaeal taxa within the same phyla tended to co-occur with each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Continental atlases and co-occurrence patterns of dominant soil archaea with shared habitat preferences in agricultural fields across eastern China.

Given that soil pH and MAT are the most important variables for respectively predicting archaeal assembly in maize and rice fields, we selected these two variables to identify the preferred sub-ecological attributes of dominant archaeal taxa corresponding to different ecological clusters. In total, the taxa were grouped into four sub-ecological clusters sharing environmental preferences, including (1) high pH and (2) low pH for dryland cluster, and (3) high MAT and (4) low MAT for paddy cluster (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). Our constructed spatial distribution maps provided estimates where we would expect the above clusters of dominant archaeal taxa to be most abundant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). As expected, the low and high pH clusters were relatively abundant in known low and high pH regions, respectively, and similarly, the low or high MAT clusters were particularly abundant in areas known for their low or high MAT soils, respectively. In addition, strong relationships between environmental variables and relative abundances of corresponding ecological clusters indicated that these were reasonably well-defined ecological clusters (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Going a step further, we estimated habitat preferences of the archaeal functional phylotypes. The ammonia-oxidizing <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> and <italic>Nitrosotalea</italic> were favored in high and low pH environments, respectively.

A previous study reported high variability in the general structure and relative abundance of dominant archaeal communities inhabiting soils at the global scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Agricultural soils are typically Anthrosols influenced by human activity, and their long-term tillage may alter the ecological diversity patterns of soil archaea and the ecosystem processes they sustain when compared with natural ecosystems. We fulfilled our study objectives, in that (1) environmental filtering plays a decisive role in driving the archaeal assembly in contrasting agricultural ecosystems; and (2) after identifying the dominant archaeal taxa and their habitat preferences, we built a continental atlas of soil archaeal communities that was distinct between dryland and wetland. These results could help us to predict the archaeal responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbances and ongoing global environmental change.</p><p id="Par20">Compared with dryland soils on which maize crops are cultivated, waterlogged paddy soils provide a rather unique habitat due to the oxygen-limited conditions generated there during frequent flooding events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This management can sustain both aerobic and anaerobic taxa in alternating dry-wet paddy soils, leading to the greater archaeal <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-diversity we found in rice than maize fields across eastern China. Several studies have shown that pH dominates the variation in archaeal diversity in forest and paddy soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, we did not observe any significant relationships between soil pH and archaeal diversity, even though our soil samples spanned a wide range of pH values (4.03&#x02013;9.89). We did find that archaeal diversity was negatively correlated with MAT in both maize and rice fields, yet positively correlated with the C:N ratio and AFe level in maize and rice fields, respectively. On the one hand, previous study has shown that microbial richness increased with temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], according to the metabolic theory of ecology and latitudinal diversity gradient. On the other hand, a recent study investigated the global topsoil from natural terrestrial ecosystems, showing that bacterial diversity peaked at mid-latitudes and declined towards the poles and the equator, which is contrary to the typical latitudinal diversity gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These contrary observations may be related to (1) the unique and more complex environment in human-managed agricultural fields compared with natural ecosystems and (2) the different microbial life-history between archaea (anaerobic) and bacteria (aerobic).</p><p id="Par21">Earlier, we had observed marked differences in the edaphic properties between our maize and rice soil samples, even though most of them were collected from adjacent pairs of sites (in submission). This could help to explain why the assembly of archaeal communities differed considerably between maize and rice soils. We also found that <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> and <italic>Nitrosotalea</italic> belonging to Thaumarchaeota, which are known as ammonia oxidizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], were mainly dominant in maize soils. By contrast, we found that the Euryarchaeota, which contains many methanogens, predominate in rice soils; this result is consistent with the view that methanogenic Euryarchaeota are restricted to mostly anoxic environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. NH<sub>4</sub> was an important contributor to the distributions of both Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. The negative correlations between Thaumarchaeota and NH<sub>4</sub> could be due to high availability of NH<sub>3</sub> to ammonia oxidizers in low-NH<sub>4</sub> environments. By contrast, the positive correlations between Euryarchaeota and NH<sub>4</sub> indicate that members of this phylum prefer environments with more available NH<sub>4</sub>-N. This resource dependence is probable given that methanogens source their nitrogen mainly from ammonium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, sulfur also contributed to the distributions of these two phyla in rice soils; a plausible explanation for this result is that archaeal-driven ecosystem processes are involved in biological electron transferring in low-oxygen environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With regard to the phyla occurring at low abundances, bathyarchaeotal taxa were positively correlated with OM, TN, AN, and TFe in rice soils, indicating their potential participation in carbon, nitrogen, and iron cycling in anoxic environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Previous study has identified several syntenic genes with homology to those involved in iron oxidation in Parvarchaeota genomes and suggested their potential role in iron cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; this lent support to our observation that some parvarchaeotal taxa were correlated with TFe in rice and maize soils. The different environmental association patterns between the maize and rice fields indicate that despite low abundances, these archaeal species might have evolved diverse metabolic functions, enabling them to adapt to contrasting environmental conditions.</p><p id="Par22">Distance-decay relationships describe decreasing community similarity with increasing geographic distance, and thus provide a directional model of variation in <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-diversity across spatial scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Importantly, the slopes of these relationships across habitats can differ, reflecting varying rates of species turnover in their habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, robust distance-decay relationships were established for archaeal communities in wetland and dryland agricultural ecosystems across a continental scale. The steeper distance-decay slope of rice fields suggests that their turnover of archaeal communities was faster than in rice fields. Since our pairwise adjacent sampling strategy covered similar spatial scales for both rice and maize fields, their different distance-decay slopes may be strongly correlated with environmental variability due to large spatial heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Rice soils can form unique, ephemeral habitats across local sites during long-term alternation of dry-wet conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], thus generating more spatially structured archaeal communities across large scales. In addition, edaphic factors evidently affected archaeal community similarity in both maize and rice fields, suggesting the consequential roles of deterministic processes in driving archaeal community assembly. Geographic factors contributed a larger proportion of variation relative to edaphic factors in the archaeal <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-diversity of rice soils than maize soils, indicating a stronger effect of stochastic processes in driving archaeal <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-diversity of rice fields. This result is partly explained by the fact that frequent flooding management generates more similar communities in sites nearer to each other than in those further apart; this should enhance inherent stochastic processes operating in rice fields, such as drift and dispersal limitation.</p><p id="Par23">A global inventory of dominant soil bacterial phylotypes consisted of a small subset of phylotypes which accounted for almost half of the 16S rRNA sequences recovered from soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the present study, the dominant archaeal taxa (amounting ~&#x02009;10% of total taxa) identified in maize and rice fields accounted for more than 90% of the archaeal sequences. We also mapped the spatial distributions of these dominant archaeal taxa in the soil samples. These results suggest that, much like soil bacteria in natural terrestrial ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], there are predictable environmental gradients and pockets for dominant archaeal taxa in agricultural soils at the continental scale, so that their spatial distributions can be predicted reliably by a continental atlas. Distinct spatial distributions were generated for the two ecological clusters of dominant archaeal taxa, separated based on their preferences of dry or waterlogged environments. The dryland cluster dominated by thaumarchaeotal taxa had a greater relative abundance in northern than southern counterparts, whereas the dominant taxa that preferred waterlogged environments, mainly euryarchaeotal OTUs, were more abundant in southern regions. Rice fields are man-made methanogenic environments, harboring a variety of euryarchaeotal methanogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This distinct continental atlas implies the contrasting habitat preferences and ecological assembly of dominant soil archaeal taxa in wetland and dryland agricultural ecosystems. In determining their habitat preferences, our results suggest that the dominant archaeal taxa tended to co-occur with others sharing the same habitat requirements. These results imply that strong phylogenetic linkages, manifested as a cluster of robust co-occurrence correlations, reflect complex associations with the same ecological attributes.</p><p id="Par24">Habitat preferences of dominant archaeal taxa are associated with their ecological characteristics, such as physiological capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. By focusing on the archaeal functional phylotypes&#x02014;e.g., ammonia oxidizers and methanogen&#x02014;we were able to predict the environmental conditions that favored them. For example, our finding that <italic>Nitrososphaera</italic> and <italic>Nitrosotalea</italic> preferred high-pH and low-pH environments, respectively, is supported by other works showing that these two genera are correspondingly alkaliphilic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and acidophilic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These consistent lines of evidence from other investigations strengthen the overall reliability of our predicted environmental preferences for these dominant archaeal taxa. We also observed that most methanogens preferred to inhabit high temperature regions. Temperature was proven to be an important factor affecting the structure and function of soil methanogenic communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our field study provides information to predict the preferred environmental conditions (e.g., low or high pH) of desired archaeal taxa and to enrich particular dominant taxa in vitro, thereby increasing our ability to successfully cultivate them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">This empirical study provides a detailed and systematic survey of soil archaeal communities in maize and rice fields across eastern China. The results indicate that environmental filtering plays a decisive role in driving the distinct continental atlases of soil archaeal communities&#x02019; wetland and dryland agricultural ecosystems. Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla dominated the maize and rice cultivated fields, respectively, indicating the existence of distinct archaeal-driven ecosystem processes within these two agricultural ecosystems. By identifying the dominant archaeal taxa along with their habitat preferences, we built a robust continental atlas of soil archaeal spatial distribution and ecological diversity, thus improving our ability to predict the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbances. Overall, our study implies that instead of considering tens of thousands of members, future research ought to narrow its focus upon the few hundred dominant taxa in soil microbial communities. This approach is also critical for quickly and accurately forecasting the ecological consequences of ongoing global environmental change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Soil sampling</title><p id="Par26">A total of 132 locations were selected from agricultural fields under long-term cultivation with maize and rice across eastern China.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with slight modifications: (1) selecting only highly abundant OTUs, i.e., those with relative abundance that ranked in the top 20% across all samples; and (2) keeping those OTUs occurring in more than half (&#x0003e;&#x02009;50%) of all the 249 soil samples. Hence, with these two criteria, the OTUs that were abundant and widely present across soil samples were considered. Given the distinct archaeal assembly patterns between maize and rice fields, we determined the ecological preferences of dominant archaeal taxa by focusing on whether they preferred a waterlogged environment. Spearman correlations identified the groups of dominant taxa with shared habitat preferences. The dominant archaeal taxa were grouped into two ecological clusters sharing habitat preferences for (1) dryland and (2) paddy. Furthermore, since soil pH and MAT are the most important variables for respectively predicting archaeal assembly in maize and rice fields, we selected on these two variables to identify the preferred sub-ecological attributes of the dominant archaeal taxa corresponding to different ecological clusters. In total, the taxa were grouped into four sub-ecological clusters sharing environmental preferences via Spearman correlations, including (1) high pH and (2) low pH for dryland cluster, and (3) high MAT and (4) low MAT for paddy cluster. To build predictive maps of the spatial distributions of the core bacterial taxa, we used a kriging interpolation method to estimate the relative abundance of each ecological cluster in maize and rice fields, respectively. This analysis was performed in the &#x0201c;automap&#x0201d; package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which automates the interpolation process by automatically estimating a semivariogram and performing kriging interpolation.
