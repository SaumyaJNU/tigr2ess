    "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) contains generous amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and dietary fibers, in addition to secondary metabolites such as phenols and flavonoids that act as antioxidants. The phenolic compounds detected in rice (organic rice (OR), conventional rice (CR), and pesticide-free rice (PFR)), namely, protocatechuic, gentisic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, salicylic, and caffeic acids, are notable free radical scavengers. The sum of these phenolic compounds was found to be higher in PFR, followed by CR and OR (p < 0.0001), when the rice types were classified based on the farming system employed. In addition, significant differences were observed in the p-hydroxybenzoic acid levels for the OR and CR groups compared with the PFR groups (p < 0.01). Furthermore, greater quantities of p-coumaric acid were found in CR-08 and OR-02, although these groups contained overall higher and lower sums of phenolic compounds, respectively. Moreover, significance was observed in the sum of the phenolic compounds, although only small quantities were found in polished rice. Further research is thus required to provide a clearer picture regarding the phenolic profiles of different rice brands."
