Generally, examining the regional and temporal variations of eating habits allows us to understand the transitions in social structure and cultural exchange. In the specific case of Japan, knowing the pre-westernisation or globalisation eating habits contributes to the understanding of food culture diversity at the basis of &#x02018;washoku&#x02019; (traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese), an UNESCO&#x02019;s intangible cultural heritage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, getting acquainted with the lifestyle in the largest cities of the early modern times (locally called the Edo period; 1603&#x02013;1868 AD) is useful due to its high recycling and self-sufficiency rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Past eating habits have been reconstructed from historical documents and illustrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Records on the lifestyle of Japanese ordinary people, including recipe books and diaries, increased since the early modern times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, special cases and events might be likely or unlikely to be recorded in historical documents. For example, records on prohibited and/or discriminated eating habits may be positively or negatively biased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, it is important to inspect and complement such literature-based knowledge with natural-scientific approaches that can reveal averaged, common and usual food habits. In ecological studies, the eating habits of animals are investigated using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (hereafter, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C and <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>15</sup>N values, respectively), based on the constant difference in <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C and <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>15</sup>N values found in the diet and in animal tissues, designated as trophic discrimination factor (hereafter, TDF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Isotope analysis has also been applied by numerous studies to the reconstruction of past human eating habits, mostly using collagen extracted from skeletons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which are neither abundant nor easily accessible. On the other hand, hair isotope ratios have typically been used to examine the regional variation of contemporary people&#x02019;s eating habits, since hair collection is technically and ethically easy and hair-specific TDF is already known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Consequently, if hairs of the past people can be collected with records on time and places, their eating habits can be accurately estimated and compared to those of contemporary times with the same TDF. Previous studies showed that amino-acid compositions of millennia-old hairs are well preserved and documented the diet in ancient human populations through isotope analysis of mummy hairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we focused on the fact that the recycled thick paper used for the covers of old books published in the early modern Japan often contains fragments of human hairs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Book publication in Japan increased explosively and popularised since the middle of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, reaching one million titles before the middle of 19<sup>th</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The covers of such books are made of recycled thick paper, which, for financial reasons, was believed to have been produced soon before book printing, using waste paper collected in the same cities where the books were printed. Because the hairs are embedded in the paper fibres, the hairs are thought to have been mixed accidentally during waste paper collection or blended intentionally for reinforcement during paper production. In either case, the hairs most likely belong to people living in the city and year of book printing, both of which are available from the records (colophon) on the book. Thus, the hairs found in each book, together with the records of time and place, constitute the ideal human tissue samples to reconstruct the eating habits at the time and place of the book printing, using isotope analysis. As a first step, this study validated the used approach by examining the isotopic variations within and between different book sets. The isotope analysis approach was then employed to reconstruct the eating habits of common people in the early modern Japan, and compare them with those of contemporary Japan, examining the temporal and regional variations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Photographs of an old book printed in the early modern Japan with human hairs.

The finding that books published in the early modern Japan contained enough human hairs, strongly supports the use of isotopic approaches for reconstructing the eating habits of those days. Collecting hairs from books is considerably easier particularly when compared to the collection and treatment of collagen from skeletons, while collagen samples have a number of advantages over hair samples.</p><p id="Par11">Unlike conventionally used collagen samples extracted from skeletons, hair samples from books may comprise a mixed sample from multiple individuals.

These results are consistent with historical facts whereupon, after the Meiji Restoration around 1860s, the Japanese eating habits were westernised, thereby people consumed more C<sub>4</sub> corns and meats with higher <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C values and lower <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>15</sup>N values. In fact, prior to the Meiji Restoration, beef eating was prohibited and discriminated in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It also seems that regional variation was larger in the early modern times than now as suggested by an isotopic study using skeletal collagen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, although direct comparison is difficult since all our samples come from big cities whereas samples of contemporary people were widely collected, including the rural areas surrounding the corresponding cities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The larger regional variation observed in the past might be due to limited food exchanges, compared to the contemporary Japan, where 62% (in 2016) of the whole foods are imported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Comparison within our samples showed that the <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C values were higher in Edo (present Tokyo) than in Osaka and Kyoto, which implies that people in Edo depended more on foods with higher <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C values than people in the other two cities. This regional difference may be due to Edo being the largest Japanese city, hence collecting a variety of agricultural and fisheries products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, some of which should have a higher <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C value than rice, C<sub>3</sub> vegetables and fish. A possible further explanation is that vitamin B1-rich C<sub>4</sub> millets were preferred in Edo as a preventive measure against beriberi (a disease that affects the heart and circulatory system, caused by lack of vitamin B1), which used to be locally called &#x02018;Edo wazurai&#x02019; (meaning the affliction of Edo) because the early modern people were affected by this disease only when they were visiting Edo, where vitamin B1-poor polished rice was most exclusively consumed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Such cultural differences might be associated with the regional variation in <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C values of hairs in the early modern Japan. The regional variation of diet in the early modern Japan was also suggested by the <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>13</sup>C and <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>15</sup>N values of skeletal collagen collected widely from rural sites in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Otherwise, the <italic>&#x003b4;</italic><sup>15</sup>N values of rice and C<sub>3</sub> vegetables may have increased in response to the increasing use of marine fish-based fertiliser in the agricultural field. In fact, the use of marine fish, such as sardines and herrings, as fertiliser in the early modern Japan is also recorded in historical documents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. A previous study also suggested that fish fertilizers might have been used for paddy rice in the early modern Japan based on a high nitrogen and sulphur stable isotope ratios of a sample of the rice hulls discovered in the inner coffin of a high-status female, who died in 1732<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Further collection and analysis of hair samples will be useful to test such detailed hypothesis in the future.</p><p id="Par16">In conclusion, we demonstrated that isotope analysis of the human hairs found in old books printed during 1690s&#x02013;1890s&#x000a0; characterised the eating habits of those days and revealed its regional and temporal variations. In previous isotopic studies, past eating habits were investigated using collagen extracted from skeletons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The use of skeletons is advantageous to compare the eating habits between past individuals, since skeletons retain personal information on biological traits. In fact, these studies clearly showed differences in eating habits between sexes and ages in the past populations. In contrast, hairs collected from books are not useful for comparisons between individuals, since the hairs may be a mixture of multiple individuals and personal information from the owners is rarely available. Instead, the book records comprise the primary advantage of using hair samples. In fact, the printing year estimated from the book records can function as sampling year to find a rough trend of the eating habits over the 200 years used in this study, even before expert correction. Uncertainty observed in the estimated time elapsed between the latest publication year and printing may be decreased to some extent by selecting books, which tend to be printed only for several years (as an example, ID61698 is a guidebook on actors in fashion). Another advantage pertains the technical and ethical easiness of hair collection from the book, which is not usually be regarded as destruction of cultural properties in contrast to the case of archaeological skeletons. Moreover, isotopic studies of contemporary people are usually done with hair samples because of the technical and ethical easiness of hair collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; thus, direct comparison of the isotope ratios with the same tissue-specific TDF is possible when the hairs are used for the study of past people. This is important given that inter-tissue and inter-species variations in TDF were recently shown as more considerable than previously believed based on earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

For two book sets that lacked colophon pages, we used the years written in the preface.

Hence, for book sets with two or more colophon pages reflecting copyright (woodblock) transfers from the original publishers to others, the latest records (mostly on the later page) were used for the analysis. Furthermore, given that the woodblocks can be repeatedly used after the publication (theoretically for hundreds of years), there may be a considerable time lag between the publication (i.e. the latest woodblock transfer) and printing of the book; thus, experts usually classify the early modern books into the first, early, and late prints by visually investigating the cracks and scratches of printed characters that reflect the age of the woodblock. In this study, an experienced bibliographer (A.I.) estimated the time elapsed after the latest publication year until printing, using periods of decades to correct the printing year (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
