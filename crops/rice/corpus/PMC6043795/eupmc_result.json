    "Plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) is a critical indicator of N status for crops, and can be used for N nutrition diagnosis and management. This work aims to explore the potential of multispectral imagery from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for PNC estimation and improve the estimation accuracy with hyperspectral data collected in the field with a hyperspectral radiometer. In this study we combined selected vegetation indices (VIs) and texture information to estimate PNC in rice. The VIs were calculated from ground and aerial platforms and the texture information was obtained from UAV-based multispectral imagery. Two consecutive years (2015 & 2016) of experiments were conducted, involving different N rates, planting densities and rice cultivars. Both UAV flights and ground spectral measurements were taken along with destructive samplings at critical growth stages of rice (Oryza sativa L.). After UAV imagery preprocessing, both VIs and texture measurements were calculated. Then the optimal normalized difference texture index (NDTI) from UAV imagery was determined for separated stage groups and the entire season. Results demonstrated that aerial VIs performed well only for pre-heading stages (R2 = 0.52-0.70), and photochemical reflectance index and blue N index from ground (PRIg and BNIg) performed consistently well across all growth stages (R2 = 0.48-0.65 and 0.39-0.68). Most texture measurements were weakly related to PNC, but the optimal NDTIs could explain 61 and 51% variability of PNC for separated stage groups and entire season, respectively. Moreover, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models combining aerial VIs and NDTIs did not significantly improve the accuracy of PNC estimation, while models composed of BNIg and optimal NDTIs exhibited significant improvement for PNC estimation across all growth stages. Therefore, the integration of ground-based narrow band spectral indices with UAV-based textural information might be a promising technique in crop growth monitoring."
