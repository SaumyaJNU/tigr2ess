Although effective vaccines for HAV infection are available, outbreaks of HAV infection still cause deaths, even in developed countries. One approach to control HAV infection is prevention through diet, which can inhibit HAV propagation and replication. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family of molecular chaperone required for endoplasmic reticulum stress and stress-induced autophagy. We previously showed that the elevation of GRP78 expression inhibits HAV replication. It has been reported that Japanese miso extracts, which was made from rice-koji, enhance GRP78 expression. In the present study, we used human hepatoma Huh7 cells and human hepatocyte PXB cells to examine the efficacy of Japanese miso extracts as antiviral agents against HAV. Japanese miso extracts enhanced GRP78 expression and inhibited HAV replication in human hepatocytes. Together, these results demonstrate that Japanese miso extracts may partly modulate GRP78 expression and additively or synergistically work as antivirals against HAV infection. Japanese miso extracts can be used as effective dietary supplements for severe hepatitis A.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HAV</kwd><kwd>miso</kwd><kwd>GRP78</kwd><kwd>rice-koji</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects humans through the fecal-oral route and causes self-limited acute hepatitis in most cases <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.

GRP78 is also associated with cancer development including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) although HAV does not cause cirrhosis or HCC <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Antiviral effects of the Japanese miso extract against HAV may partly involve the enhancement of GRP78 expression, which inhibits HAV replication <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Knockdown or knockout of GRP78 could enhance HAV replication <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Win et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> also demonstrated that the ER stress inducer thapsigargin could induce GRP78 expression and inhibit HAV replication. Thapsigargin is a non-competitive inhibitor of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and induces ER stress. A previous study also showed an association between viral replication and ER stress pathways <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. However, thapsigargin is associated with cellular apoptosis and autophagy, and causes cell death <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In the present study, we did not demonstrate that the direct inhibition of HAV replication was caused by enhancement of GRP78 expression.</p><p>Of interest, we observed the different expression levels of GRP78 and HAV RNA between two cell lines (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It may be why Huh7 and PXB are derived from HCC and non-HCC tissues, respectively. GRP78 protects against chemical agents as well as from the natural machinery of the immune system <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Cancer cells resistant to destruction by T killer cells were found to overexpress GRP78 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Human hepatoma Huh7 cells express a large amount of GRP78 at baseline, compared with primary hepatocytes PXB, which are derived from PXB mice. This seemed to cause discrepancy in the results of both cell lines. GRP78, a chaperone and master regulator of the ER stress, has been demonstrated to play a key role in several flavivirus infections <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Contrary to our observation, the Japanese encephalitis virus release was reduced 10-fold during siRNA knockdown of a cytoprotective agent GRP78 transcript. Virus infection can lead to significant ER stress. Further studies will be needed about the association between GRP78 and HAV replication <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, 0.5% miso extracts do not have any strong cytotoxicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It may be high concentration for liver cell when considering the amount of miso consumption because the concentration of miso soup is ~10% miso extracts. However, it is possible that concentration of miso ingredients in the liver after absorption might be higher than those concentration. There are three types of miso: rice-koji miso, soybean-koji miso and barley-koji miso <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. In the present study, we used rice-koji miso. In general, Japanese people like miso and consume it every day in their meals. Khan et al. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> found that miso soup significantly decreased the risk of gastric cancer. In addition, Sharp et al. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> reported that the consumption of miso soup and other soya foods may reduce the risk of HCC. Moreover, Ito et al. <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> demonstrated that the effects of the habitual consumption of miso soup might decrease the heart rate.</p><p>It was reported that soybean &#x003b2;-conglycinin-derived peptides have antiviral effects <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. A prospective randomized clinical trial also showed that soy supplementation decreased ALT levels and may improve hepatic inflammation in patients with hepatitis C virus <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Although both KU and IG are rice-koji miso, we also demonstrated that these rice-koji miso had antiviral effects against HAV. Therefore, it has been noted that miso has several beneficial effects on non-communicable and communicable diseases <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p><p>In the Tokyo area, only 14% of Japanese people have anti-HAV antibodies <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, as socio-economic conditions such as sanitation have been improved. It is possible that an epidemic outbreak of HAV may occur in communities or even extend to several countries. As the mode of transmission of HAV is through the mouth, it may be advantageous to take miso orally to prevent HAV infection. Japanese miso extract may prevent patients with acute hepatitis A from progressing to acute liver failure. In South Korea adjacent to Japan, they also have another rice-koji miso and recently had large hepatitis A outbreaks <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In Japan, we have not recently experienced large hepatitis A outbreaks although there were small hepatitis A outbreaks <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Socio-economic factors, lifestyle preferences, dietary habits, and many more factors could be responsible for the differences in HAV outbreaks in South Korea versus Japan.</p><p>In conclusion, Japanese miso extracts exert a significant effect on the inhibition of HAV replication in human hepatocytes in association with the elevation of GRP78. Mechanism of the antiviral action of Japanese miso extracts should be explored.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. R.
