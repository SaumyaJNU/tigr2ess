A large portion of Indian population lives in villages. They maintain their livelihood depending on agriculture. In West Bengal state, a large number of people are engaged in different types of agricultural jobs throughout the year. The Paddy (rice) is the main crop in this state. Both men and women workers are involved in this job and expend a great extent of their physiological cost for crop production. Among them women have great and important roles in different processes of crop production. Although investigations of men workers predominated, it is actually women who comprise the majority of subsistence farmers in developing countries.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It is only relatively recently the role that woman play in the agriculture of developing countries has been recognized by agricultural experts and development agencies. It is important that women's roles and needs are not ignored.</p><p>The problems of agricultural task in developing countries were somewhat different from that of developed countries. In contrast to industrially developed countries, a large proportion of the population in developing countries is involved in agriculture. Although today Indian agriculture depends to a very large extent on manual labor, modernization has reached some parts of the subcontinent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The agricultural jobs are executed by adopting very difficult posture. Those postures may be the limiting factors, to some extent, for human capabilities. The agricultural workers have to face many job related problems during work.</p><p>For the rice (paddy) cultivation, several steps are followed, for example., preparation of land, sowing of seeds, uprooting of seedlings, transplantation, reaping, binding of straws, carrying of straw bundles, and threshing. Women workers are involved in most of the above said jobs. The preparation of land is done to make it suitable for the cultivation. It is first and most essential step for any type of cultivation. The paddy seeds are thrown on the prepared soil. After a few days; the seeds are germinated and grown into seedlings. For proper growth of seedlings, the farmers maintain optimum irrigation. After this, the seedlings become suitable for uprooting and transplantation. Workers use both their hands to grasp the base of shoot and pull them carefully. The seedlings become uprooted. After uprooting a number of seedlings, they wash the muddy root of the seedlings and tie them to form a bundle.</p><p>The workers adopt different postures during performing the above mentioned jobs. Sometimes, some of the postures that are adopted by the workers are very harmful. However, they are compelled to adopt those postures during work, even for a long time. Most of the tasks performed by the cultivators are monotonous, strenuous, physiologically demanding, and time-consuming.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Because of adopting different postures during different agricultural jobs, they suffer in different problems or pain in their limbs and also in other body parts.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In the present investigation, uprooting operation has been considered. Usually, the women workers are performing this uprooting job in forward bending and squatting postures. These postures are known to create serious strain injuries. The prolonged forward bending posture causes high static muscular load particularly in the trunk region.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The cumulative load on the musculoskeletal structures reflected in the form of high prevalence of discomfort and pain in neck, shoulder, and lower back and lower limb regions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the present investigation, the prevalence and features of work related musculoskeletal disorder (WRMSD) studied on the women agricultural workers who are engaged in uprooting job of rice cultivation. In addition, special emphasis has been given on the postural stress of women workers during performing their job.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS AND</sc> M<sc>ATERIALS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Site and subjects</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted on 166 women cultivators having the age range of 18&#x02013;50 years from Howrah, Purba Midnapore, and Paschim Midnapore districts of West Bengal state, India. Exclusion criteria for the participants included presence of any self reported chronic hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory diseases, or an accident affecting the musculoskeletal system. Pregnant and lactating women were also excluded from the study. The authors disqualified 28 participants because they were not eligible by these criteria. Seventeen women cultivators were not interested in participating in the present study, and nine women cultivators were excluded from the study because of incomplete or missing of data. Thus, a final total of 112 women cultivators participated in the present survey. The average age of the women cultivators was 34.85 &#x000b1; 10.78 years. The average height and weight of the participants were 150.61 &#x000b1; 6.5 cm and 46.22 &#x000b1; 10.05 kg.</p><p>Prior to the data collection, the protocol was explained verbally to the participants to obtain their understanding and cooperation.

A &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; in the scale meant no discomfort at all and &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; in the scale indicated intolerable discomfort. According to the degree of severity, the perceived rating of discomfort score of the 10-point scale were divided into three subgroups: Mild pain was defined as scale &#x02264;4; moderate pain was defined as scale 4.1 to 6.9 and severe pain as scale &#x02265;7.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The mean value of scores (perceived rating of discomfort) of all segments was taken as the overall discomfort rating of the workers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Evaluation of work rest pattern</title><p>The work-rest patterns of women cultivators were determined by directly observing their work and by taking interviews of the workers.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The total work shift was divided into work cycle and rest cycle. The rest period was the sum of prescribed rest pause (rest for food break) and work related rest pause (rest taken by the worker for self requirement/or during working hour). The actual work time was calculated by subtracting the actual rest pause from total work time. It was recorded carefully from beginning to end of the work by direct observation method employing video-photography on the job. For this purpose, whole day task performance of the workers were recorded in DVD mode and the recorded DVD run in by media player (XingMPEG player, version 3.30) in the computer after setting a time. After a careful and repeated observation, the whole day work was evaluated and the duration of work time and different rest pauses of the workers were noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Determination of postural pattern</title><p>For evaluating the postural stresses, the postural pattern of the workers during performing their job was studied by direct observation method.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The work posture of each participant was studied for whole working period.

The segments of body that were highly affected were lower back, hip, wrist, upper back, shoulder, neck, and knee. In our previous study on women cultivators engaged in threshing job of rice cultivation, it was noted that WRMSD was highly prevalent in lower back, wrist, upper back, shoulder, and knee regions.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Osborne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that the prevalence of MSDs among the farmers was greater than the non-farmer populations. WRMSDs top the list of occupational health morbidities' in developing countries due to lack of effective ergonomic interventions to reduce injuries and eliminate poor working conditions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Montakarn and Nuttika[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Reddy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that MSDs is a major public health problem all over the developing countries and it is one of the leading causes for sickness absenteeism, disability, days of work lost, and hamper productivity at work. Yazdanirad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] also stated that WRMSDs are the main cause of occupational injury and disability in industrialized countries and affecting not only individuals but also organizations and society. MSDs are the common occupational hazards among the agricultural workers. The higher prevalence of MSDs among the women cultivators might be related to the prolonged work in awkward postures (forward bend posture and squatting posture). Present study revealed that workers had to perform the task for a prolonged period of time with lesser period of rest. Researchers pointed out that higher incidence of MSDs may be related to the postural pattern at work, repetitive movements, and longer duration of exposure in awkward posture.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Madhwani and Nag[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that awkward and static postures cause musculoskeletal stress on different body regions and are a major factor in the development of WRMSDs. The women cultivators had to start their day before dawn to finish off their household chores such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes and dishes, etc., before they moved off to the fields, which altogether impose them under additional stress.</p><p>The back pain was highly prevalent among the study participants. The workers suffered from such problems might be because of adopting forward bending and squat sitting postures for long time. In uprooting job, they were compelled to twist their trunk frequently. The spinal rotation may cause chronic strain as when the workers twist their waist during work.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In a study by Osborne <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that the farmers were suffering from WRMSD at different body segments particularly lower back region followed by upper and then lower extremity. The lower back pain has been regarded as double burden on the quality of life and on health expenditure.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The main reason for frequent backaches was a pathological degeneration of the discs of spinal column. Awaked postures such as forward bending and squatting postures wore out the discs and induced hazards on the supporting system of spine and trunk. The pressure inside the discs was considerably increased when the trunk was bent forward compared with standing in an upright position. The intradiscal pressure was also higher in the sitting than in the standing posture. This was certainly due to the turning mechanism of the hips in the sitting position, which produced a kyphosis in the lumber region of the spine. A great increase in intradiscal pressure must be considered as an unnecessary load and strain on the discs. It was generally accepted that prolonged heavy manual work might encourage the development of degenerative changes in the joints.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>MSD at upper extremity was also highly prevalent among the workers. Higher prevalence of MSD at shoulder might be due to frequent movement and abduction of shoulder during uprooting job caused static load imposes in the shoulder. The MSD at neck was also high. Repetitively movement of shoulder and static load on the trapezius muscles may be cause of the musculoskeletal illness in the shoulder and neck.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The trapezius is the main lifter of the shoulder girdle and is important in stabilization of the scapula, which is necessary when making precision movement of the arm. The load on the trapezius may, therefore, be considered a reasonable indicator of load on the shoulder and neck region. In addition to that the workers reported pain in their wrist. There were dorsiflexion, ventriflexion, and lateral movements of wrist joint during uprooting operation that impose static load on it. Repetitive exertions and excessive movements of the wrist increase the resultant reaction force on the tendons passing through the carpal tunnel. The resultant reaction force could degenerate and inflame the tendons, thereby causing tenosynacitis, or compress the median nerve between the carpal ligament and tendons, which could cause carpal tunnel syndrome.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The worker reported MSDs in different parts of lower limbs during performing uprooting job. The most affected part of the lower limb was thigh and knee. In uprooting job, the movement of the lower limb was very less. Therefore, a great amount of static load was imposed on the upper leg muscles during working under forward bending and squat sitting postures. This might be the possible reason for the occurrence of MSDs at thigh. Pal and Dhara[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that forward bending and squatting postures in the workplace are significant contributors for MSD at knee and thigh.</p><p>Human body has a CG and in any movement of body the position of CG plays an important role. In the present study, the location of CG of the women workers in normal erect posture was around 60% of body height. In our previous study among the women cultivators, the CG in normal erect posture was also around 60% of body height.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The present study showed that the working CG at different postures (forward bend and squatting postures) was deviated during performing uprooting job. In squatting posture, the location of CG shifted downwards, i.e., toward the base of the body. When the CG was shifted toward the base of the body, it became more stable than that in erect posture.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, the results of posture analysis by different methods revealed that squatting was awkward posture, which leads to strain in different joints and muscles of the lower limbs. The CG indicates the stability of the body. However, work in squatting posture leads to static postural load on the lower limbs caused MSD at those areas. The location of the CG shifted away from the base of body during performing the job in forward bend posture. As the CG shifted upward, biomechanical stress was imposed on the body that might be the cause of MSD. Das and Ganguli,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Sen and Ray[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that the shift in CG imposed maximum postural load in forward bend postures when considered from the viewpoint of biomechanical stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>The present study concluded that the higher prevalence of WRMSDs among the women cultivators may be because of prolonged working hours and awkward postures.

It may be suggested that ergonomic interventions such as modifying work-rest schedules, improving work postures, and introducing new design hand tools should be taken for improving work condition and postures of the women cultivators to reduce their work stress. Awareness and training programs about personal protective devices, correct work posture, and proper work methods among the workers may be another solution of the problem.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
