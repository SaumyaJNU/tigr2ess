Ratoon stunting Disease (RSD) of sugarcane, caused by <italic>Leifsonia xyli</italic> subsp. <italic>xyli</italic>, is widespread in countries and regions where sugarcane is grown and also limited to sugarcane productivity. Although the whole genome sequencing of <italic>Leifsonia xyli</italic> subsp. <italic>xyli</italic> was completed, progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of the disease has been slow because it is difficult to grow in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The <italic>Leifsonia xyli</italic> subsp. <italic>xyli</italic> membrane protein gene <italic>Lxx18460</italic> (anti-sigma K) was cloned from the <italic>Lxx</italic>-infected sugarcane cultivar GT11 at the mature stage using RT-PCR technique, and the gene structure and expression in infected sugarcane were analyzed. The <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene was transformed into <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> by <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediation. The transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing <italic>Lxx18460</italic> had lower levels in plant height, leaf area, net photosynthetic rate and endogenous hormones of IAA, ABA and GA<sub>3</sub>, as well as lower activities of three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than the wild type (WT) tobacco. With the plant growth, the expression of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene and protein was increased. To better understand the regulation of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> expression, transcriptome analysis of leaves from transgenic and wild type tobacco was performed. A total of 60,222 all-unigenes were obtained through BGISEQ-500 sequencing. Compared the transgenic plants with the WT plants, 11,696 upregulated and 5949 downregulated genes were identified. These differentially expressed genes involved in many metabolic pathways including signal transduction, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and so on. Though the data presented here are from a heterologous system, <italic>Lxx 18460</italic> has an adverse impact on the growth of tobacco; it reduces the photosynthesis of tobacco, destroys the activity of defense enzymes, and affects the levels of endogenous hormones, which indicate that <italic>Lxx18460</italic> may act important roles in the course of infection in sugarcane.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">This is the first study on analyzing the function of the membrane protein gene <italic>Lxx18460</italic> of anti-sigma K (&#x003c3;K) factor in <italic>Leifsonia xyli</italic> subsp. <italic>xyli</italic>.

Among these genes, 11,696 genes were upregulated and 5949 genes downregulated after 110&#x02009;days transforming <italic>Lxx18460</italic>.

It was found that the amino acid sequence has low homology with those from other strains, so it is speculated that most &#x001a1; factor homology is not high between different bacterial strains. Since the anti &#x001a1; factor has huge differences in structure and sequence, the bacteria could respond to the stimulus elements, which could better regulate certain gene transcriptions and expressions. Studies have shown that the concentration of <italic>Lxx</italic> in sugarcane is different in various tissues, and the <italic>Lxx</italic> titers decreasing from the basal part to the tail of stalk in sugarcane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the expression of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> in infected plant is related to the level of <italic>Lxx</italic> in different organs of sugarcane. We used the purified protein of Lxx18460 to obtain monoclonal antibody, which can be used for qualitative and quantitative detection of Lxx18460 protein.

Tang et al.

In this study, we analyzed the function of <italic>Lxx</italic> membrane protein gene <italic>Lxx18460</italic> (anti-sigma K) by transforming it into tobacco, and then investigated the phenotypic, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes in the transgenic tobacco plants. We found that the net photosynthetic rate was lower in the transgenic tobacco than that in WT plants. The reason may be that <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene inhibited the expression of photosynthetic enzyme genes, and this speculation was confirmed by quantifying the relative expression of photosynthesis related genes using RT-PCR. We observed that the expression of <italic>Rubisco</italic> and <italic>PEPC</italic> genes were inhibited in the transgenic tobacco. Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that the net photosynthetic rate in tomato decreased after infected with tomato yellow leaf curl virus. Sun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that 51 down-regulated genes coded the proteins involved in photosynthesis in rice after blast infection, and the pathogen suppressed the photosynthesis genes&#x02019; expression and decreased the photosynthesis greatly. Plant could form an antioxidant protection mechanism to remove excess free radicals, and the defense enzymes of SOD, POD and CAT play a very important role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

In this study, the SOD, POD and CAT and T-AOC activities in the <italic>Lxx18460</italic> transgenic tobacco declined as compared to the WT plants, which suggested that the defense capability had been decreased by transformation of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene. The transcriptome analysis results also showed that the expression of catalase was decreased. The transgenic plants were more susceptible to membrane damage compared to the WT plants. The pathogen <italic>Lxx</italic> showed extremely strong infection effect though it had been diluted for hundreds of times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It might be possible that at the beginning of the infection, the expression of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene in pathogenic bacteria inhibits the gene transcription of the defense enzymes and damage the defense regulation of host plants, which would help the pathogen to infect the host and to multiply inside the plant cell. Growth of plant is not only affected by the change of various enzyme activities, but also regulated by various endogenous hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. According to the results of this study, the syntheses of GA<sub>3</sub>, IAA and ABA were inhibited in the <italic>Lxx18460</italic> transgenic plants, which suggested that the expression of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene suppresses the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of the endogenous hormones.

As the result the plant height was lower and the leaf area smaller, subsequently, the plants become dwarf and smaller, and the biomass decreased. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the expression level of <italic>Lxx18460</italic> gene and Lxx18460 protein was stably increased with time course during plant growth.
