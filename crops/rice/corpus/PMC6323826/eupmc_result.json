    "BACKGROUND:Sugarcane is an important sugar and economic crop in the world. Ratoon stunting Disease (RSD) of sugarcane, caused by Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli, is widespread in countries and regions where sugarcane is grown and also limited to sugarcane productivity. Although the whole genome sequencing of Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli was completed, progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of the disease has been slow because it is difficult to grow in culture. RESULTS:The Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli membrane protein gene Lxx18460 (anti-sigma K) was cloned from the Lxx-infected sugarcane cultivar GT11 at the mature stage using RT-PCR technique, and the gene structure and expression in infected sugarcane were analyzed. The Lxx18460 gene was transformed into Nicotiana tabacum by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediation. The transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing Lxx18460 had lower levels in plant height, leaf area, net photosynthetic rate and endogenous hormones of IAA, ABA and GA3, as well as lower activities of three antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than the wild type (WT) tobacco. With the plant growth, the expression of Lxx18460 gene and protein was increased. To better understand the regulation of Lxx18460 expression, transcriptome analysis of leaves from transgenic and wild type tobacco was performed. A total of 60,222 all-unigenes were obtained through BGISEQ-500 sequencing. Compared the transgenic plants with the WT plants, 11,696 upregulated and 5949 downregulated genes were identified. These differentially expressed genes involved in many metabolic pathways including signal transduction, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and so on. Though the data presented here are from a heterologous system, Lxx 18460 has an adverse impact on the growth of tobacco; it reduces the photosynthesis of tobacco, destroys the activity of defense enzymes, and affects the levels of endogenous hormones, which indicate that Lxx18460 may act important roles in the course of infection in sugarcane. CONCLUSIONS:This is the first study on analyzing the function of the membrane protein gene Lxx18460 of anti-sigma K (ÏƒK) factor in Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli. Our findings will improve the understanding of the interaction between the RSD pathogen Leifsonia xyli subsp. xyli and sugarcane. The output of this study will also be helpful to explore the pathogenesis of RSD."
