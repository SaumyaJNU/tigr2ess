    "BACKGROUND:Temperature stress is a major environmental factor affecting not only plant growth and development, but also fruit postharvest life and quality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs that play important roles in various biological processes. Harvested banana fruit can exhibit distinct symptoms in response to different temperature stresses, but the underlying miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms remained unknown. RESULTS:Here, we profiled temperature-responsive miRNAs in banana, using deep sequencing and computational and molecular analyses. In total 113 known miRNAs and 26 novel banana-specific miRNAs were identified. Of these miRNAs, 42 miRNAs were expressed differentially under cold and heat stresses. Degradome sequencing identified 60 target genes regulated by known miRNAs and half of these targets were regulated by 15 temperature-responsive miRNAs. The correlative expression patterns between several miRNAs and their target genes were further validated via qRT-PCR. Our data showed that miR535 and miR156 families may derive from a common ancestor during evolution and jointly play a role in fine-tuning SPL gene expression in banana. We also identified the miRNA-triggered phased secondary siRNAs in banana and found miR393-TIR1/AFB phasiRNA production displaying cold stress-specific enrichment. CONCLUSIONS:Our results provide a foundation for understanding the miRNA-dependent temperature stress response in banana. The characterized correlations between miRNAs and their response to temperature stress could serve as markers in the breeding programs or tools for improving temperature tolerance of banana."
