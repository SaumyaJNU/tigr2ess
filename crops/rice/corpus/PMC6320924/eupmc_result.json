    "Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is a globally important rice disease and the increasing resistance of this pathogen highlights the need for new active compounds against rice sheath blight. In this study, natural β-carboline alkaloids were optimized to obtain a series of 1,2,4,9-tetrahydro-3-thia-9-aza-fluorene derivatives and evaluated for their fungicidal activity and mode of action against R. solani. Of these compounds, 18 exhibited significant in vitro fungicidal activity against R. solani, with an EC50 value of 2.35 μg/mL, and was more active than validamycin A. In vivo bioassay also demonstrated that 18 displayed superior protective and curative activities as compared to validamycin A. Mechanistically, 18 not only induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and accumulation of reactive oxygen species, but also interfered with DNA synthesis. Therefore, compound 18 displayed pronounced in vitro and in vivo fungicidal activity against R. solani and could be used as a potential candidate for the control of rice sheath blight."
