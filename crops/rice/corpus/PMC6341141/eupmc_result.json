    "This study was investigated to compare the natural variation of nutrients in rice variety by different environmental factors. Fifteen kinds of rices were used, which were cultivated in two locations for 2Â years. All data were analyzed by the various statistical tools to identify the nutritional variations of nutrients. The results of variable importance in the prediction analysis were found to be consistent with the % variability. The nutrient compositions most affected by variety were fatty acids, and next were vitamins, proximate nutrients, minerals, and amino acids in order. The nutrient compositions most affected by location were proximate, followed by minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and amino acids. For cultivation year, vitamins were most affected and then minerals, fatty acids, proximate nutrients, and amino acids in order. These findings could explain that each kind of nutrients can be naturally varied by different environmental factors."
