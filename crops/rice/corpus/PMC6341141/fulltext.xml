Also, these are useful to the food industry and food&#x02010;based dietary guidelines for different sources of food nutrients. Furthermore, the nutritional compositions of commercial plants can play an important role by providing information on natural chemical components as well as the presence and amounts of interacting components. Specifically, for the safety assessment of new biotechnology organisms such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the level of nutritional compositions of commercial crops is considered as references for the identification of significant compositional changes in GMOs (EFSA, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Because of the natural compositional change in commercial crops, it is necessary to study whether the component change due to other biotechnology belongs to this natural variation category or not. Natural variation of the components in crops has been reported in several articles (Nicole &#x00026; Daniel, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Thomas, Richard, Howard, Eugenia, &#x00026; Karl, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Statistical methods for compositional assessment can be used to identify natural variability differences observed from plant varieties or other variables. The natural variation of plants nutritional composition can be influenced by a number of environmental factors such as cultivation location and plant varieties, many of which can be barely controlled and induced natural variations. Also the micronutrients content and bioactive substances can be mainly affected by the seasonal variations in plant foods (Collomb et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). For this reason, the tolerant or confidence interval range of nutritional compositions by statistical tools can be used to improve credibility from obtained experimental data. Tolerance intervals are the most appropriate for evaluating whether or not a transgenic variety is within the normal range for commercial varieties of the same crop. Until now, in order to study the environmental effects of crop components, many researches have been conducted using suitable statistical models. As it was deemed reasonable to interpret integrated statistical models for natural variations of the components by environment, this study was intended to produce comprehensive results by various statistical techniques. All data were suggested by the mean value and standard deviation with the tolerance interval. The natural variation of rice nutrition by using various statistical methods was also investigated. The effects of genotype and environmental variables on the compositional variations were identified through statistics. The environmental factors used were cultivation location, kinds of cultivar, and cultivation year. Rice grain samples (brown rice) were analyzed for their key nutritional components as recommended by OECD consensus document (OECD, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). All analyzed data were loaded to the database of web service, &#x0201c;DB for nutritional components of plant foods,&#x0201d; to be used to the GMO safety. All data were compared statistically by using mean and standard deviation.</p><p>This study provided information on the natural variation in rice nutrient composition according to various environmental factors, and the results may offer reasonable and scientific assessment in nutritional profiles for future genetic modified of rice or other plants.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0002"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Rice samples</title><p>Fifteen kinds of rice varieties were cultivated at two different geographical locations namely Cheonan and Jeonju in South Korea in 2015 and 2016. Rice varieties were all commercially available with similar genetic background, the &#x0201c;Japonica&#x0201d; type. Varieties used in this study were Keumo (KO), Nakdong (ND), Nampyeong (NP), Dongan (DA), Samkwang (SK), Seolhyangchal (SHC), Sobi (SB), Anmi (AM), Yeongan (YA), Odae (OD), Unkwang (UK), Chilbo (CB), Hiami (HA), Hwaseong (HS), and Hwayoung (HY). These rice varieties were all planted in May and harvested in October in each location. The environmental conditions at these locations are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Rice varieties were planted at each field sites with a strip&#x02010;plot design in five replicates per site. Rice plants were all pretreated for analysis based on the previous research conducted (Oh, Park, Yeo, Park, &#x00026; Kim, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Whole grain (rough rice) samples were collected from each block and dried at a final moisture concentration of 9%&#x02013;11% for compositional analysis based on the previous study conducted. The rough rice varieties were manually dehulled using a hulling machine (TR 13) to produce brown rice grain and then finely ground using a planetary mono mill (Pulverisette 6; Fritsch, Germany). The powdered grain of each sample was transferred immediately to &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><table-wrap id="fsn3839-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Environmental conditions of Cheonan and Jeonju in 2015 and 2016</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Location</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Soil pH<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fsn3839-note-0001">a</xref>

Crude fat was analyzed using Soxhlet extraction method (AOAC, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2000a</xref>) while crude protein amount was calculated from total nitrogen content using Kjeldahl method (AOAC, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005a</xref>). Ash content was determined by incinerating the sample in a furnace at 600&#x000b0;C for 22&#x000a0;hr to constant weight (AOAC, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2005b</xref>). Carbohydrates were calculated by 100% minus sum of % protein, % lipid, and % ash.

The sulfur&#x02010;containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) were oxidized using performic acid before hydrolysis with 6N hydrochloric acid. The contents of individual amino acids were expressed by % of total protein.

Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> was assessed according to the method of Sims and Shoemaker with a slight modification (Sims &#x00026; Shoemaker, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Vitamin B<sub>1</sub> was extracted from the rice samples (0.1&#x000a0;g) by adding 1&#x000a0;ml 0.1&#x000a0;N hydrochloric acid, vortex mixing for 20&#x000a0;s, and placing in a water bath at 80&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min.

For each nutrient component of rice varieties, the means and ranges were calculated with five replications per varieties. TIs were suggested for every component to describe the statistical natural ranges in commercial rice. The 99% TI with 95% confidence intervals for each component was assessed using proc capability in the SAS 9.2 software (Lai, Yen, &#x00026; Chen, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This criterion of confidence level can cover the distribution to fall the interval for the &#x003b3;&#x02010;content of tolerant interval. Negative limits are set to zero. The interaction effect of the variety, location, and year which can influence nutrition variation was also calculated by using the lme4 package of R statistics (version 3.4.3, 2017). With this R package, the linear mixed model was developed for the random effect of data (intercept) and described the distribution of three vector&#x02010;valued random variables for variety, location, and year. To complement this statistical model and to estimate the importance of each nutrient variable with metabolite data in rice cultivars, the statistics of the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) value for variables from the PLS&#x02010;DA were performed. VIP value was illustrated in a descending order of importance in the nutrient compositions. VIP score is the weighted sum of squares of the PLS loadings. The value of explained Y variance in each dimension influences the weights of sum of PLS regression coefficients (Bijlsma et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Xia, Psychogios, Young, &#x00026; Wishart, <xref rid="fsn3839-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In order to visualize the effect of genetic and environmental backgrounds on nutritional variation, the data were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA). PCA was performed based on analysis of means using BioPAT&#x02010;SIMCA (ver. 13; Umetrics, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden) to evaluate differences visually among groups of multivariate data. The results of PCA were shown with score plots and loading plot to visualize the contrast between different samples. All data were automatically scaled using unit variance before PCA application. Finally, the two&#x02010;way ANOVA by SAS package (9.2; SAS Institute) was used to verify the PCA results of components for more statistical or scientific analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0006"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0007"><label>3.1</label><title>Nutritional compositions of 15 rice varieties</title><p>To investigate the natural variations in the nutritional compositions of 15 commercial rice varieties, the rice varieties were cultivated in the test farms in Cheonan and Jeonju.

The components with no differences between two locations were crude fiber, alanine, arginine, aspartam, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, serine, tyrosine, P, S, miristate, palmitate, and eicosenoate.

For this reason, this study investigated how the composition varies by different environmental effects through several methods of statistical approach. First, the environmental effect on the natural variation of composition was examined by using R statistical procedure. As an appropriate for compositional data from experimental field studies, the linear mixed model in R statistics was used to describe the random effect on the nutritional variation and to state the overall differences and equivalence. The statistical analysis of the experimental data for the compositional assessment is limited to the mean difference and the substantial equivalence over various location and various cultivars. Therefore, a linear mixed model was used for the statistical analysis of compositional data to solve the confidence limits. By using this model, the random effect of environmental factors such as varieties, locations, and cultivation years could be assumed. The variability between variety, location, and year was estimated as related to natural variation in nutrient compositions. For the purpose of modeling the natural variation or variability of components from commercial rice varieties, the individual factors of variety, location, and year, and the mixed variables to interpret the co&#x02010;interactions, were subjected to R statistical analysis.</p><p>The result of % variability for proximate from R statistics according to the environmental effects showed that the natural variation of proximate was mainly contributed by the location (26.36%), followed by the year (14.59%) and variety (11.00%) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Crude fat was most affected by the variety (13.69%) while crude fiber and IDF were most affected by year (Supporting Information Table <xref rid="fsn3839-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). In the results of % variability for amino acids, the year variable most affected the variation of amino acid composition (10.04%), followed by the variables location (5.84%) and variety (0.14%) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Most amino acids were highly affected by the year, especially cysteine, proline, and tyrosine (Supporting Information Table <xref rid="fsn3839-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The amino acids most affected by the location were methionine (43.85%) and tryptophan (23.44%) (Supporting Information Table <xref rid="fsn3839-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The result of % variability for minerals showed that minerals were most affected by year (26.91%) and next by the location (21.74%) and variety (8.91%). Specifically, the composition variation of S, Cu, and Zn was most highly affected by the year. The minerals affected by the variety rather than other variables were Mg, P, and Mn, while the Ca and Na contents were most affected by the location as compared to other factors. In the result of % variability of fatty acids, the natural variation of fatty acids was mainly contributed by the variety (56.96%), and then by the year (24.39%) and location (10.35%). Most fatty acids were affected by the variety factor, except for the stearate and linolenic acid which were affected by the year factor. In the % variability of vitamins, the natural variation was mainly contributed by the year (28.09%), next by the variety (11.70%), and location (11.40%) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

VIP analysis was conducted according to environmental factors such as variety, location, and year. As the value of VIP score of components is higher, it can be more important to the applied model. Taking VIP cutoff of around 1.0, the following nutrient compositions were found to be significant among 49 metabolites in the variety model: linolinate, palmitate, arachidate, Vit B1, oleate, miristate, crude fiber, stearate, linoleate, lipid, Mn, Vit E, eicosenoate, Vit B7, moisture, tryptophan, Cu, protein, ash, Fe, Mg, and Zn. Only two features had a VIP score higher than 1.5 that suggested the highest importance of these variables to the variation in the variety model. In the VIP score for the location model, protein, carbohydrates, methionine, linoleate, moisture, Ca, Mn, Na, proline, Mg, Vit B7, Fe, tryptophan, stearate, and Cu had over 1.0 VIP score. Only protein had the VIP score higher than 1.5; therefore, this was most important to the variation in the location model. Under the year model, Vit B2, Vit B3, IDF, Zn, linolenate, stearate, TYR, PRO, Cu, CYS, Ca, linoleate, MET, palmitate, Fe, and Ash had scores over 1.0 VIP. Among these components, Vit B2, Vit B3, IDF, and Zn had VIP scores higher than 1.5, indicating that these were significant to the variation in the year model. Because the VIP analysis result was similar to the % variability from R analysis, it could be concluded that the nutrient compositions most affected by variety were fatty acids, followed by vitamins, proximates, minerals, and amino acids. The nutrient compositions most affected by location were proximates, minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and amino acids in order while those most affected by year were vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, proximates, and amino acids in order.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="fsn3839-fig-0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Variable importance in projection (<styled-content style="fixed-case">VIP</styled-content>) plot identified by <styled-content style="fixed-case">PLS</styled-content>&#x02010;<styled-content style="fixed-case">DA</styled-content> in a descending order of important nutrients to the variance due to environmental factors (i.e., variety, location, and year)</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-5" xlink:href="FSN3-7-163-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0010"><label>3.4</label><title>PCA results of each compositional nutrient</title><p>Principal component analysis results showed the distribution figure of mean value for the proximate components, amino acids, minerals, fatty acids and vitamins, and were compared by investigating the degree to which they are separated by the factors of cultivars, locations, and cultivation year (Figures&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fsn3839-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

The statistical analysis of experimental data for the compositional assessment is limited to the mean difference and the substantial equivalence over various location and various cultivars. Therefore, a linear mixed model is used for the statistical analysis of compositional data to solve the confidence limits. The random effect of environmental factors such as varieties, locations, and cultivation years was estimated as a trigger for natural variation in nutrient components. For the purpose of modeling the natural variation or % variability of components from the analyzed data, the individual factor of variety, location, and year and mixed variable of three factors which could be interpreted for the interactions with component variations were introduced into the R statistics. The nutritional component showing the highest natural variation by rice variety factor was fatty acids, followed by vitamins, proximate, minerals, and amino acids. The natural variation of proximate component was mainly contributed to the location factor. In the case of amino acid, minerals, and vitamins, the natural variations were mainly affected by the year factor (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="fsn3839-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Each nutrient showed a natural variation caused by environmental factors, and it is believed that various statistical applications can be useful to assess the nutritional safety or equivalence of new plants developed by biological techniques.</p></sec><sec id="fsn3839-sec-0014"><label>4.3</label><title>Comparison of PCA analyzed according to environmental factors</title><p>A PCA analysis was conducted to see how the analyzed component values are separated according to environmental factors such as kind of cultivar, cultivation location, and cultivation year. From the PCA results, the PCA analysis only showed visually that the nutrient components are distinguished by environmental factors. But further statistical analysis is required to conclude whether they differ or not. In this study, ANOVA analysis was applied to complement the PCA results and determine whether they differ or not according to environmental factors.</p><p>In conclusion, the natural variations of nutrients caused by the environmental factors were compared by using the % variability, VIP, and PCA analyses. The PCA results could be interpreted as differences between factors (such as between regions, species, and genetic types) together with the result of variance of SAS. The result of % variability with VIP results could be interpreted for natural variations of a component by suggesting the main contributors to nutrient variability. Through these multiple statistical tools, it was found that the natural variation of the nutrients varied depending on the environmental factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="fsn3839-sup-0001"><caption><p>&#x000a0;</p></caption><media xlink:href="FSN3-7-163-s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="fsn3839-sec-0015"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the National Academy of Agricultural Science (Code PJ011752012018), Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.
