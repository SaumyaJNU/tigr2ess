Here, we report that diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), a plant growth regulator, increases germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds by increasing fatty acid metabolism and glycometabolism. Phenotypic analysis showed that DA-6 treatment markedly promoted germination and seedling establishment from naturally and artificially aged soybean seeds. Further analysis revealed that DA-6 increased the concentrations of soluble sugars during imbibition of aged soybean seeds. Consistently, the concentrations of several different fatty acids in DA-6-treated aged seeds were higher than those in untreated aged seeds. Subsequently, quantitative PCR analysis indicated that DA-6 induced the transcription of several key genes involved in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to sugars in aged soybean seeds. Furthermore, the activity of invertase in aged seeds, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to form fructose and glucose, increased following DA-6 treatment. Taken together, DA-6 promotes germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds by enhancing the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and the conversion of fatty acids to sugars.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aged soybean seed</kwd><kwd>DA-6</kwd><kwd>fatty acid</kwd><kwd>germination</kwd><kwd>glycometabolism</kwd><kwd>seedling establishment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31872804</award-id><award-id>31701064</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Research and Development Program of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2017YFD0201306</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Sichuan Science and Technology Program</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018JZ0060</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The legume species soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.) originated in East Asia (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Kuroda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Lam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and is now widely grown, being the primary oilseed crop in the world, with the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India, and China being the main soybean-growing countries (<xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Schulte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In China, where soybean production depends on maize&#x02013;soybean intercropping, the area under which soybean is grown has increased significantly in recent years (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that, despite this, China is currently the major soybean-importing country globally; to meet the increasing demand for plant protein, oil, and food, further improvements in soybean production are essential.</p><p>Seed germination is one of the most important stages of the plant life cycle, contributing to the distribution of wild species, and to increased yield and quality of cultivated crop plants (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Shu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2016<italic>b</italic></xref>, <italic>c</italic>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Kan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Rubio de Casas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Generally, the emergence of the radicle indicates the completion of seed germination (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bewley, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Shu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>c</italic></xref>). Immediately following seed germination, seedling establishment is another key developmental stage, whereby the seedling transitions from the heterotrophic to the autotrophic state (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Thelen, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Theodoulou and Eastmond, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Consequently, both seed germination and seedling establishment are essential for subsequent plant development. It is worth noting that both processes are powered by the energy that is stored in the seed itself (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Thelen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (FAD-GPDH) pathway has been proposed to be involved in the breakdown of fatty acids and glycerol in plant seeds (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Huang, 1975</xref>). Several elegant studies demonstrated that the FAD-GPDH cascade is particularly important in oilseed plants, by which the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol releases free fatty acids and glycerol, with the fatty acids and glycerol then being converted to sugars, which support the seed germination and seedling establishment processes (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Theodoulou and Eastmond, 2012</xref>). The Arabidopsis <italic>SDP6</italic> (<italic>Sugar-Dependent 6</italic>) gene encodes FAD-dependent glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (FAD-G3P), and, although <italic>sdp6</italic> mutant seeds are able to germinate, the seedlings exhibit a marked arrested growth phenotype in the absence of exogenous sucrose during the seedling establishment stage (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This means that the transition from glycerol and fatty acids to sucrose is significantly impaired in <italic>sdp6</italic> seeds, with the exogenous supply of sucrose fully rescuing the arrested growth phenotype of the <italic>sdp6</italic> mutant (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Another key gene, <italic>SDP1</italic> (<italic>Sugar-Dependent 1</italic>), encoding a patatin-like domain-containing triacylglycerol lipase, also plays a key role during post-germinative growth (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2006</xref>). In <italic>sdp1</italic>, the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol is blocked, resulting in <italic>sdp1</italic> seeds also exhibiting an arrested growth phenotype in the absence of sucrose, mimicking the <italic>sdp6</italic> phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2006</xref>). Altogether, both the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and the conversion of fatty acids and glycerol to sugars are important for the successful powering of seed germination and seedling establishment, with the sugar supply allowing the young seedlings to achieve the photosynthetic autotrophic state (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Kelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that, compared with the cereal crop seeds, including rice, wheat, and maize, soybean seeds contain much higher oil and fatty acid contents (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Lestari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Dhakal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Teng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). During storage, seed respiration, a catabolic reaction, utilizes glucose and other biomolecules (principally oils and fatty acids), and, as a consequence, significantly shortens seed longevity and decreases the rates of seed germination and seedling establishment, even causing soybean seeds which had been stored for long periods to be incapable of germination (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Barros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Munz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The ability of aged soybean seed to germinate decreases markedly as storage time increases; interestingly, the loss of germination potential also correlates with a decline in RNA integrity in soybean seeds following prolonged storage (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fleming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Another study demonstrated that, during natural aging processes, phospholipase D&#x003b1; (PLD&#x003b1;) affected the soybean seed phospholipid and triacylglycerol profiles, suggesting that suppression of PLD&#x003b1; activity in soybean seed has the potential to improve seed quality during long-term storage (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). A decline in the germination ability of aged soybean seed significantly constrains soybean production, as it results in poor germination and seedling emergence from farm-saved seeds in the field. Therefore, it would be worthwhile developing an efficient method to promote the germination and seedling establishment of aged soybean seeds. Moreover, dissection of the precise physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced germination and seedling emergence capabilities of aged seeds will help us to better understand the soybean seed germination and seedling establishment processes.</p><p>Diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6) is a novel artificial plant growth regulator, which can increase leaf chlorophyll content, and increase the photosynthetic rate and the rates of carbon and oxygen metabolism in plants (<xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">Yokoyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In agriculture, DA-6 has been registered for use on a range of crops, including cabbage, pakchoi, cotton, tomato, soybean, peanut, and maize (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, DA-6 also increased microalgal growth and simultaneously improved the quality and quantity of microalgal lipid for biodiesel production (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Salama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), while treatment with DA-6, in combination with EDTA, appeared to be optimal for the remediation efficiency of <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> L. (perennial ryegrass) on lead-contaminated soil (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, to date, minimal information is available on the role of DA-6 in seed science research especially on seed germination and early seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds.</p><p>Here, we report that DA-6 promotes germination and seedling establishment in naturally and artificially aged soybean seeds by increasing triacylglycerol hydrolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and glycometabolism. Several types of physiological and biochemical analyses and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays demonstrated that DA-6 increased the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and the conversion of fatty acids to sugars during imbibition of aged soybean seeds, and, consequently, increased seed germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds. We believe that this effective treatment will significantly expand the potential applications of DA-6 in agricultural systems, especially in countries where farm-saved seed is at risk of deterioration during storage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and growth condition</title><p>The prevailing soybean cultivar in Southwestern China, Nandou-12 (ND-12), was employed in this study.

This study also demonstrated that aged soybean seeds actually contain sufficient energy for germination, stored in the seeds as different food reserves, namely triacylglycerol, fatty acids, glycerol, and sugars. However, the aged seeds cannot use the storage energy, except for soluble sugars, because the conversion of triacylglycerol to soluble sugars appears to be blocked, resulting in the failure of seed germination and early seedling establishment.</p><sec id="s20"><title>DA-6 has a positive effect on germination and early seedling establishment in aged soybean seeds</title><p>Numerous elegant studies have demonstrated that DA-6, an artificial plant growth regulator, has a range of biological functions which can impact on field crop production (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Salama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The present investigation extended the practical uses of DA-6, demonstrating that DA-6 can reverse the loss of germination and seedling establishment activities associated with aging in soybean seeds.</p><p>Seed germination and subsequent seedling establishment are vital steps during the plant life cycle, contributing to the determination of plant distribution in wild species, and of yield in crops. Research from the laboratory, including the current study, has demonstrated that the decrease in seed germination ability as the seed ages is positively associated with the duration of the storage period (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Yin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fleming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In tillage agriculture, farm-saved seeds are stored by the farmer for varying periods of time, often under less than ideal conditions, resulting in seed aging and a decline in germination characteristics. Consequently, enhancement of the germination and seedling establishment from aged seeds is a worthwhile target in both basic and applied aspects of plant biology and crop production research.</p><p>Interestingly, a previous study had reported that hydrated graphene ribbon treatment could promote the germination of aged wheat seeds by increasing the concentrations of carbohydrate, amino acids, and fatty acids, and ensuring cell membrane integrity (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Zhou, 2014</xref>). Ultrasonic treatment also improved seedling growth from aged grass seeds, including <italic>Festuca arundinacea</italic> Schreb. (tall fescue) and <italic>Psathyrostachys juncea</italic> L. (Russian wildrye), but the underlying mechanisms need further investigation (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). A more recent study revealed that phytosynthesized silver nanoparticles increased the germination of aged rice seeds, with the mechanisms underlying this positive effect being suggested to include enhanced water uptake, rebooting of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) antioxidant systems in seeds, generation of hydroxyl radicals to achieve cell wall loosening, and nanocatalysis to accelerate starch hydrolysis (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Mahakham <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, most of these studies focused only on germination but not seedling establishment from aged seeds, and identified that there were diverse mechanisms underlying the effects promoting germination of aged seeds.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>DA-6 enhances the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to sugars in aged soybean seeds</title><p>It is noted that the process of seed germination is distinct from that of seedling establishment, especially in aged soybean seeds. Germination analysis showed that percentage seedling establishment was generally lower than that of seed germination, especially in the soybean seeds stored for 10, 22, or 34 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). For the soybean seeds stored for 34 months, the germination rate reached ~10%, but there was zero emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These data suggested that the level of releasable energy stored in the seed itself is important for both processes (seed germination and seedling establishment); if the energy reserves were exhausted in the first stage (seed germination), then the germinated seed could not complete the second process (seedling establishment).</p><p>It is well known that the primary energy sources used by seeds during germination and seedling establishment are the soluble sugars, principally sucrose and fructose (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eastmond, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Quettier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Theodoulou and Eastmond, 2012</xref>). In oilseed species, including soybean and Arabidopsis, the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol produces fatty acids and glycerol, with the fatty acids and glycerol both being further converted into sucrose (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Theodoulou and Eastmond, 2012</xref>). Consequently, these biochemical reactions, converting triacylglycerol to fatty acids and glycerol, and fatty acids and glycerol to sucrose, are vital for generating the energy to complete the seed germination and seedling establishment processes.</p><p>In the present investigation, we found that the germination ability of aged soybean seeds (following long-term storage) was lower than that of seeds stored for a shorter period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), and that DA-6 treatment significantly increased the germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figs S2, S4</xref>). Subsequent research indicated that the conversion of seed storage oil (triacylglycerol) into sucrose during imbibition was insufficient to power germination of the aged soybean seeds in the absence of exogenous DA-6 application. Several lines of evidence supported this conclusion. DA-6 treatment markedly increased the levels of different types of fatty acids and soluble sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). In line with this, qPCR analysis further showed that DA-6 treatment increased the transcription of several key genes involved in the triacylglycerol hydrolysis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the findings from the present investigation demonstrated that, during imbibition of aged soybean seeds, DA-6 increases the rate of hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to fatty acids and glycerol, and also the conversion of fatty acids and glycerol to sucrose and fructose by promoting the transcription of the key genes and the activity of the enzymes involved in those pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). On one hand, this study extended the range of agronomic and physiological crop processes identified as being affected by DA-6. On the other hand, the present investigation also demonstrated that the conversion of triacylglycerol to soluble sugars is important for the germination of aged seeds of oilseed crops.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>The proposed working model through which DA-6 promotes germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds. In the aged soybean seeds, the transition from triacylglycerol to fatty acid and glycerol and then to the soluble sugars was blocked in the absence of DA-6. The application of exogenous DA-6 treatment in aged soybean seeds promoted the transcription of several key genes and elevated the activity of invertase which is involved in this pathway. Taken together, this model revealed that DA-6 promotes the germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds by increasing the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and the conversion of fatty acids and glycerol to sugars.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ery24709"/></fig><p>Given the importance of the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) in the regulation of seed germination (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Shu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2016<italic>c</italic></xref>, <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the relationship between DA-6 and the biosynthesis and signaling pathways of ABA and GA during germination of aged soybean seeds needs further investigation. For instance, does DA-6 regulate the biosynthesis and/or signal transduction pathways of ABA and GA? DA-6 is an artificial plant hormone, so the dissection of its receptor(s) will help us better understand the action of DA-6. Furthermore, the relationship between the DA-6 receptor(s) and ABA and GA also needs further exploration. Future studies should address whether DA-6 is also involved in the regulation of germination and early seedling establishment in aged seeds of the cereal crops (such as wheat, rice, and maize).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s22"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
