    "Soybean seeds contain higher concentrations of oil (triacylglycerol) and fatty acids than do cereal crop seeds, and the oxidation of these biomolecules during seed storage significantly shortens seed longevity and decreases germination ability. Here, we report that diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6), a plant growth regulator, increases germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds by increasing fatty acid metabolism and glycometabolism. Phenotypic analysis showed that DA-6 treatment markedly promoted germination and seedling establishment from naturally and artificially aged soybean seeds. Further analysis revealed that DA-6 increased the concentrations of soluble sugars during imbibition of aged soybean seeds. Consistently, the concentrations of several different fatty acids in DA-6-treated aged seeds were higher than those in untreated aged seeds. Subsequently, quantitative PCR analysis indicated that DA-6 induced the transcription of several key genes involved in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to sugars in aged soybean seeds. Furthermore, the activity of invertase in aged seeds, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to form fructose and glucose, increased following DA-6 treatment. Taken together, DA-6 promotes germination and seedling establishment from aged soybean seeds by enhancing the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol and the conversion of fatty acids to sugars."
