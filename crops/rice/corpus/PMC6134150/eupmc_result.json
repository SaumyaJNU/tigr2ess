    "Efficient germplasm exploitation in crop breeding requires comprehensive knowledge of the available genetic diversity. Linking molecular data to phenotypic expression is fundamental for the profitable utilisation of genetic resources. Italian rice germplasm is an invaluable source of genes, being characterised by marked heterogeneity. A phenotypic characterisation is presented in this paper, with a focus on the evolutionary trends, and on the comparison with available molecular studies. A panel of 351 Italian rice varieties was analysed using seven key morphological traits, employing univariate and multivariate analyses. Considerable variability was found, with clear morphological trends towards reduced plant height, earliness, and spindle-shaped caryopses. Previous findings indicating that genetic diversity was maintained throughout time could not be confirmed, as small phenotypic variability was found in the most recent rice varieties. Consistency with phylogenetic data from previous studies was partial: one phylogenetic subgroup was phenotypically well distinct, while the others had overlapping characteristics and encompassed a wide range of phenotypic variation. Our study provides a quantitative ready-to-use set of information to support new breeding programs, as well as the basis to develop variety-specific calibrations of eco-physiological models, to identify promising traits in light of climate change conditions and alternative management scenarios."
