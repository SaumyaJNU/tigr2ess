    "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE:As aging progresses, the number of patients with cognitive impairment also increases. Cognitive function is not generally correlated with diet, and there is debate over that association. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the association between dietary intake and cognitive function among adults aged 50 years or older. SUBJECTS/METHODS:Between July 2017 and March 2018, 324 adults aged over 50 years from Gwangju Sun-Han hospital participated in a dietary survey. The frequency of food intake and related information were collected using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQ-FFQ) and determining the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) level for 276 participants. The association between dietary intake and cognitive function was assessed by performing logistic regression analysis. RESULTS:Depending on the MMSE score, the participants' age, education level, inhabitation status, medications, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, physical activity, and short geriatric depression scale score were significantly different (P < 0.05). Moreover, those participant characteristics were associated with either decreased or increased odds ratios (OR) for the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Based on analysis of the participants' intake of 112 detailed food items, which were categorized into 20 food types, intakes of cooked white rice (< 2 times/day compared with â‰¥ 3 times/day) (P < 0.05), properly cooked rice with other grains and legumes (P < 0.001), fruits (P < 0.05), milk (low fat and normal) (P = 0.044), liquid-type yogurt (P = 0.019), and curd-type yogurt (P = 0.015) were found to significantly decrease the OR for the risk of MCI. CONCLUSIONS:Associations were significant between the risk of MCI and the intake of certain food types. Specifically, a moderate intake of cooked white rice and an adequate intake of whole grains, fruits, milk, and dairy products were associated with reduced risks of MCI among adults aged over 50 years."
