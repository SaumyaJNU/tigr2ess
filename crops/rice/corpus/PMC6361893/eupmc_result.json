    "This study aimed to evaluate the Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine generation ability under food heat processing conditions including pH (5.0-9.0), temperature (25 °C, 31 °C, 37 °C, 42 °C and 65 °C), NaCl concentration (10%, 15% and 20%, w/v) and glucose concentration (0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, w/v). S. aureus biofilm genetic character was obtained by PCR detecting atl, ica operon, sasG and agr. Biofilm biomass and metabolic activity were quantified with crystal violet and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium staining methods. S. aureus biofilm was sensitive to food heat processing conditions with 37 °C, pH 7.0, 2% glucose concentration (w/v) and 10% NaCl concentration (w/v) were favorable conditions. Besides, free and bound Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine level in weak, moderate and strong biofilm were detected by optimized high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine level in S. aureus biofilm possessed a significant gap between strong, moderate and weak biofilm strains. This investigation revealed the biological and chemical hazard of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm to food processing environment."
