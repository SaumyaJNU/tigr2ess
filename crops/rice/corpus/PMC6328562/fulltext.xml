Every industry be it food, pharmaceutical, cosmetology or any other, wishes to design an economical and robust process that can be reproducible effortlessly. The increasing need to bring down the elevated product cost ultimately deduces on process development. A sequential array of multiple unit operations under upstream and downstream process forms a bioprocess. The forthcoming tendency in drafting an economical bioprocess is integration of several unit operations in a single step. To decrease or integrate a number of unit operations involved, it is highly required to design a distinct processing stage that accomplishes the objectives of the unit operations being replaced. ATPS has got wide practice in extraction, separation, purification, and upgradation of biomolecules, as well as in separating precious metals, sewage water treatment and detection of drug residues in food samples. ATPS is a liquid-liquid fractionation technique, based on the simple phenomenon of immiscibility of two aqueous solutions such as polymer-polymer (e.g. polyethylene glycol-PEG and dextran) and polymer-salt (e.g. phosphate, citrate, sulphate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Other than conventional polymer and salts, various other components of aqueous systems include smart polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, poly-propylene glycol-PPG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, polyethylene oxide sulphide-PEOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, alcohols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, organic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, surfactants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, as well as ionic liquids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Aqueous two phase separation techniques and its plausible variants possess the required characteristic for process integration. Extractive fermentation supports rapids exclusion of product into separate phase, thus circumventing product inhibition and degradation in a bioprocess. The method have been validated with synthesis and retrieval of cyclodextrins (CDs) from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, metallic single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) from semiconducting SWCNTs has also been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Fermentative production and separation of ethanol as well as acetone-butanol using simple sugar (glucose) as substrate by <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic> respectively was done with PEG-dextran as the phase forming components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The three major areas of research where ATPS proves a better alternative are extractive bioconversion, extractive fermentation, and integration of primary downstream process such as cell disruption and purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Albertson (1970), laid the foundation behind the concept of partitioning of cells and macromolecules in ATPS. The research was further extended to separate cells according to their surface properties with high selectivity and resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The prime objective of studying ATPS here is to replace and integrate various unit operations involved in fermentative production of pullulan, with the single stage aqueous partitioning. Extractive fermentation or <italic>in situ</italic> product removal, is a novel process deriving from ATPS where the microbial system grows in one phase and the product of interest being extracellular in nature is excreted out and partitioned towards the other phase. Consequently the product of interest is extracted without disturbing biomass.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic> is a black yeast like fungus, acknowledged mostly for its capability of producing pullulan as extracellular polysaccharide. Pullulan is an extraordinary biopolymer with many structural and functional characteristic features, multidisciplinary applications and innumerable patents. The unique &#x003b1; (1&#x02192;4) glycosidic linkage between maltotriose unit and &#x003b1; (1&#x02192;6) glycosidic bond connecting consecutive maltotriose units, laud the polymer with exclusive physical properties such as adhesiveness, film and fiber forming capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Pullulan has got extensive application in the field of food, pharma, cosmetics, clinical and healthcare industries along with other miscellaneous uses. Pullulan as intensifier and starch substituent has been used in sauce, syrups, pickle and preservative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Pullulan films are clear, edible, moldable, homogeneous, heat sealable, printable, and impermeable to oxygen. Composite membrane of pullulan with gelatin, lipid, protein, rice wax and antibiotics have further increased the quality of the pullulan films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Despite all the advantage and applications of pullulan, its high cost has restricted its use and commercialization on grand scale. The fermentative synthesis of pullulan has been extensively studied and well described. But the downstream processing of the exopolysaccharide follows the same conventional process of biomass removal, organic acid precipitation followed by drying to obtain pulverized pullulan. The whole process endure more economic and environmental stress due to the excessive use of organic solvents. It is also considered that downstream process contributes major factor for high cost of biomolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The number of unit operations involved directly tolls upon the quality and yield of pullulan. A symbolic representation of the extractive fermentation process attempts to justify the logic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A symbolic flow diagram for the process integration of pullulan production with extractive aqueous two phase fermentation process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_37314_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e344"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The use of ATPS in pullulan recovery and partial purification has been previously described, but extractive fermentation has not yet been employed for the exopolysaccharide production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Whereas PEG ($ 46.57 in extractive fermentation process), dextran ($ 7.33) and acetone ($ 215.15) came at very minimal price in comparison to ethanol, thus decreased the total process cost to several folds.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Comparative analysis of capital investment between the proposed method i.e. Extractive fermentation, ATPS and Conventional organic solvent precipitation for the production of 1 kg of pullulan.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>S.no</th><th>Process</th><th>Chemical requirements</th><th>OSPPT ($)</th><th>ATPS&#x000a0; ($)</th><th>Extractive fermentation ($)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="8">1.</td><td rowspan="8">Seed Culture</td><td>Sucrose</td><td>12.76</td><td>10.66</td><td>12.40</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium Sulphate</td><td>0.0039</td><td>0.0033</td><td>0.0038</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium Chloride</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.034</td><td>0.040</td></tr><tr><td>Ferrous Sulphate</td><td>0.0021</td><td>0.0018</td><td>0.0021</td></tr><tr><td>Manganese Sulphate</td><td>0.0027</td><td>0.0022</td><td>0.0026</td></tr><tr><td>Zinc Sulphate</td><td>0.0014</td><td>0.0012</td><td>0.0014</td></tr><tr><td>Dipotassium Hydrogen Phosphate</td><td>1.13</td><td>0.94</td><td>1.10</td></tr><tr><td>Ammonium Sulphate</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.15</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">2.</td><td rowspan="7">Fermentation</td><td>Sucrose</td><td>127.92</td><td>106.39</td><td>124.34</td></tr><tr><td>Yeast</td><td>17.68</td><td>14.73</td><td>17.19</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium Chloride</td><td>1.23</td><td>1.03</td><td>1.20</td></tr><tr><td>Dipotassium Hydrogen Phosphate</td><td>28.24</td><td>23.53</td><td>27.45</td></tr><tr><td>Ammonium Sulphate</td><td>1.56</td><td>1.30</td><td>1.51</td></tr><tr><td>PEG</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>46.57</td></tr><tr><td>Dextran</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>7.33</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">3.</td><td rowspan="4">Downstream processing</td><td>Ethanol</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>Poly Ethylene Glycol</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>39.85</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>Dextran</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>6.28</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>Acetone</td><td>&#x02014;</td><td>184.41</td><td>215.17</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td colspan="2">TOTAL PRICE</td><td>

Thus the fungus can survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. In the various ATPS systems <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic> also survived, the viability was observed in the form of dry cell mass collected after extractive fermentation process. The biomass was indeed lesser then regular fermentation conditions (58.72&#x02009;g/l), of biomass was observed in all the systems formed even a scant amount of microbial growth was observed with high molecular weight PEG (PEG-6000) and high bi-sodium phosphate salt concentration (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These results established that the high salt concentration in PEG-bi-sodium phosphate extractive fermentation systems does not support proper cell growth. As PEG has got no negative effect on the growth of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic> in the ATPS systems, it was recommended to observe polymer-polymer ATPS system for microbial growth and pullulan production. It has been also reported that dextran is not utilized by microorganism during growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Among all the four PEG-dextran systems, system 11 with PEG 4000 and dextran facilitated maximum cell growth and clear, distinct phases. It is very much clear that, between polymer-salt and Polymer-polymer systems, PEG-Dextran system readily supports the growth of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic>, and can easily be delivered in extractive fermentation of ATPS.</p><p id="Par15">Benavides <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> explained an increase in excluded volume at both the phases with rise in polymer molecular mass, this in turn results in particle and biomass movement towards the interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The phenomenon precisely justified the biomass shifting towards interface with higher molecular mass PEG and high pH (9.0).The phenomenon of particle shifting towards interface due to excluded volumes occurs at higher molecular weight of PEG, which was also observed with PEG 6000-dextran.</p><p id="Par16">The bottom phase preference of pullulan could be explained in terms of polarity. Dextran has numerous hydroxyl groups along the chain whereas PEG has got only two hydroxyl groups at the terminal of the molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The presence of oxygen in pullulan entitle its affinity towards dextran, since it has got numerous hydroxyl groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This was validated by the partition coefficient values. Since, pullulan has a low molecular weight (&#x0003c;1000&#x02009;g/mol), the effect of excluded volume on the PEG 6000-Dextran system is negligible.</p><p id="Par17">A huge difference in the amount of exopolysaccharide produced under the two systems is observed, with a significant <italic>in situ</italic> recovery of pullulan in PEG 6000-dextran system as compared to PEG 6000-salt system. Remarkably, the <italic>in situ</italic> pullulan recovery in PEG 6000-dextran system is also superior to conventional organic solvent precipitation protocol. This outcome highlights the shortcomings in the conventional process and possible product loss during tedious downstream processing scheme.</p><p id="Par18">The results obtained in this study, justified the proposed advantages of Aqueous Two Phase system (ATPS) for the extractive fermentation of pullulan from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic>. The PEG-dextran ATPS system was found to be suitable for the growth of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>pullulans</italic> in top phase and partitioning of pullulan to the other phase. The yield of the extractive fermentation process was found to be 36.47&#x02009;g/L, slightly higher than organic solvent precipitation process (35.84&#x02009;g/L) and lesser than ATPS process (42.17&#x02009;g/L). The proposed process aptly integrates upstream and downstream process for continuous production and recovery of pullulan from the biomass, thus reducing the time quotient of the whole process. ATPS proved to be the most economical process with an expenditure of $ 389.29, followed by extractive fermentation process ($ 4454.46) and organic solvent precipitation process with a huge investment of $ 1799,44. Extractive fermentation or <italic>in situ</italic> recovery of pullulan proved to be an environmental friendly, reliable and reproducible process.
