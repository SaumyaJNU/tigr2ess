    "The vigorous shoots and roots help to improve drought resistance and post-transplanting recovery in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). Hundreds of loci related to root system have been identified recently, but little research has been done on shoot traits, and the relationship between roots and shoots development is also still unclear. The objective of this study was to identify associated loci for roots and shoots in rice seedlings as well as to screen pleiotropic QTLs involved in coordinated development of roots and shoots. Using mini core collection of 273 cultivated rice accessions and 280 simple-sequence repeat markers, we investigated six traits [root length (RL), root thickness (RT), root weight (RW), shoot length (SL), shoot weight (SW) and ratio of root-to-shoot mass] in seedlings. Study was performed in hydroponic medium and genetic analysis was performed by association mapping using general linear model (GLM) with population structure (Q) and mixed linear model (MLM) involving Q and familial relatedness (K). Two subgroups indica and japonica showed significant differences in RT, RW and SW. Maximum correlation was observed between RW and SW. Using GLM 65 QTLs for root and 43 QTLs associated with shoot traits were detected. Among them, seven QTLs were present between RL and RW and five common QTLs were detected between SL and SW with high phenotypic variation effects (PVEs). Two key pleiotropic QTLs were also identified involved in collaborative development of roots and shoots in rice seedlings. Importantly, 17 and 10 QTLs were identified for root and shoot traits respectively in both studies of GLM and MLM. More common QTLs with high PVEs between root and shoot traits suggested that longitudinal growth (RL and SL) played an important role in accumulation of biomass (RW and SW). Considering the obvious phenotypic differences and fewer common QTLs between indica and japonica, we suggested that there could be different mechanisms of seedling development between both subpopulations. Key pleiotropic QTLs and QTLs identified for root and shoot traits in both studies of GLM and MLM could be preferentially used in marker-assisted breeding for strong rice seedling."
