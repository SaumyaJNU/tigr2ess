    "In the present study rice straw (R, control) was mixed with Cowdung (C), Azolla (A) and cellulolytic fungus Aspergillus terreus (F) in different combinations viz. RC, RA, RF, RCF, RCA, RFA and RCFA and subjected to aerobic composting (Acom) and vermicomposting (Vcom - with Eisenia fetida). It was found that addition of azolla and cattledung to two parts straw(RCA-666: 314:20 g) caused fastest degradation (105 days), gave maximum population buildup of E. fetida (cocoons, hatchlings and worm biomass), highest decline in pH, EC, TOC and C/N ratio and maximum increase over control in N(17.72%), P(44.64%), K(43.17%), H (7.93%), S (14.85%), Ca(10.16%), Na(145.97%), Fe(68.56%), Zn(12.10%) and Cu(32.24%). Rice straw (R) took longest time for degradation i.e. 120 and 140 days and had lowest content of nutrients in Vcom as well as Acom group. RCFA was also converted into Vcom at the same time but other parameters were less than RCA except for highest content of B (19.87%), Mg(21.27%) and Mn (5.58%). Bioconversion of three parts straw (RCA-735:245:20 g) was also faster (110 days) with vermicomposting than all the mixtures of Acom group (130-140 days) but nutrient content was slightly less than RCA with 2 parts straw. The results show that azolla reduces dependence on cattledung for recycling the carbon rich rice straw and enhances its agronomic value."
