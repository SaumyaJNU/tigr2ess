    "Single-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were constructed using rice bran (carbon source) and pond bottom mud (microbial source). The total electric charge obtained in the MFC combining rice bran with pond bottom mud was four times higher than that in MFC using only rice bran. Phylogenetic analyses revealed dominant growth of fermentative bacteria such as Bacteroides and Clostridium species, and exoelectrogenic Geobacter species in the anode biofilms, suggesting that mutualism of these bacteria is a key factor for effective electricity generation in the MFC. Furthermore, rice bran, consisting of persistent polysaccharide, was pretreated by the hydrodynamic cavitation system to improve the digestibility and enhance the efficiency in MFC, resulting in 26% increase in the total production of electricity."
