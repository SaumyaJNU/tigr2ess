We used an early senescence leaf (<italic>esl</italic>) mutant rice and compared it with its isogenic wild type variety to evaluate the effect of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (VHA-A1) gene mutation on the rhizosphere fungal community structure and composition using a metagenomic pyrosequencing approach. The most predominate fungal phyla identified for both isogenic lines belonged to <italic>Ascomycota</italic>, <italic>Basidiomycota</italic> and <italic>Glomeromycota</italic>, where <italic>Ascomycota</italic> were more prevalent in the <italic>esl</italic> mutant than the wild type variety. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed a significant rise in the richness of <italic>Cladosporium cladosporioides</italic> in <italic>esl</italic> mutant rice than the wild type variety. Correlation analysis revealed four most abundant genera identified for the <italic>esl</italic> mutant and their close association with yield and biomass decline, lipid peroxidation, lower root vitality, chlorophyll degradation and limited VHA activity. Higher K<sup>+</sup> efflux, H<sup>+</sup> and a lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was also observed in the <italic>esl</italic> mutant which could be the reason for abnormal functioning of mutant plants. These results illustrate that besides the well-known effect of senescence on plant physiology and yield decline, it can further shape the rhizosphere fungal community.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31701329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015M580560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003392</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016J01100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is the main staple food consumed by more than half of the world population, with more than 480 million metric tons produced annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hybrid rice varieties have been developed to overcome biotic and abiotic stresses and increase the yield. However, a major constraint in hybrid rice production that can result in yield reduction thereby threatening food security is the timing of leaf senescence during the grain filling stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. There are three possible reasons for the substantial decline in yield and grain quality owing to the timing of senescence: (i) reduction in biomass accumulation via photosynthetic activity termination, (ii) nutrient remobilization from senescing tissues to actively growing parts furthermore, (iii) senescence associated with environmental stress that causes yield reduction as well as lower nutrition status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In cereals, leaf senescence is characterized by nutrient remobilization, chlorophyll degradation, and sometimes death of tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Chlorophyll degradation, which is a familiar phenomenon in the leaf senescence program, is accompanied by a decrease in photosynthetic activity, chloroplast structural loss, protein degradation, lipid membrane peroxidation, and malondialdehyde (MDA) buildup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This physiological set of events linked with senescence is prompted by the reprograming of many genes, down- or up-regulated, in response to definite senescence-promoting elements. Previous studies have reported the ability of biotic and abiotic stress that speed up leaf senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Several studies indicate how abiotic stresses trigger leaf senescence by reprogramming certain subsets of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) that are differentially expressed in distinct tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, information about the relationship between leaf senescence and biotic factors is limited, especially with respect to leaf senescence related to rhizosphere microbes. Previous research has shown that plant roots are in complex interaction with soil microbial communities in which both biotic and abiotic factors play major roles in shaping the microbial communities in soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been indicated that the rhizosphere where plant roots interact is a plant nutrient enhanced niche is extremely competitive environment that also influences plant root health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, attention has been given to the soil biodiversity, particularly plant-microbe communications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Therefore our study seems to be relevant as some fungi can destroy the whole agricultural field by causing plant diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, while others have antagonistic capabilities towards plant pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Recent investigations have indicated that plant genotype also has a great influence on the structure of root microbiomes, implying the role of the host in the construction of microbial communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

However, other studies reported that plant developmental stages also alter the rhizosphere microbial population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> more than the host genotype itself.</p><p id="Par7">It is well documented that transport through the tonoplast (across membranes) is energized by two proton pumps, the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) and the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The collective activity of the two pumps generates the proton gradient and the membrane potential for transport by hydrogen ion gradient driven symport of compounds against their concentration gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

A deeper understanding of soil microbial community composition and diversity coupled with the use of senescence-associated mutants can help improve our understanding of senescence mechanism at a late developmental phase in economically important crops. However, to our knowledge there is no information presented on how premature senescence influences the rhizosphere microbial communities at grain-filling stage. We hypothesized that plant modifications influencing the quality and quantity of resources available for microorganisms could reveal some of the observed variations in rhizospheric fungal communities. Hence the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (VHA-A1) gene mutation in rice expressing early senescence leaf (<italic>esl</italic>) on the rhizosphere fungal community composition and diversity. Our study was aimed to clarify the underlying mechanism of early senescence that occurs in <italic>esl</italic> mutant rice using pyrosequencing approach.

This data clearly indicates that microbial communities found in the wild type variety is significantly different from those in the mutant samples. In addition, the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated distinct differences in fungal community structure among the two treatments and similar arrangements for the same samples when evaluated in three replications (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
