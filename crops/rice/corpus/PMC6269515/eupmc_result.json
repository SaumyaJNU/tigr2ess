    "Generally, plant roots shape the rhizosphere fungal community but how individual plant genes involved in senescence affect this shaping is less studied. We used an early senescence leaf (esl) mutant rice and compared it with its isogenic wild type variety to evaluate the effect of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (VHA-A1) gene mutation on the rhizosphere fungal community structure and composition using a metagenomic pyrosequencing approach. The most predominate fungal phyla identified for both isogenic lines belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota, where Ascomycota were more prevalent in the esl mutant than the wild type variety. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed a significant rise in the richness of Cladosporium cladosporioides in esl mutant rice than the wild type variety. Correlation analysis revealed four most abundant genera identified for the esl mutant and their close association with yield and biomass decline, lipid peroxidation, lower root vitality, chlorophyll degradation and limited VHA activity. Higher K+ efflux, H+ and a lower Ca2+ influx was also observed in the esl mutant which could be the reason for abnormal functioning of mutant plants. These results illustrate that besides the well-known effect of senescence on plant physiology and yield decline, it can further shape the rhizosphere fungal community."
