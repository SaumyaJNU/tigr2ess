    "BACKGROUND:The majority of eukaryote genomes can be actively transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are functionally important in development and evolution. In the study of maize, an important crop for both humans and animals, aside from microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, few studies have been conducted on intermediate-size ncRNAs. RESULTS:We constructed a homogenized cDNA library of 50-500 nt RNAs in the maize inbred line Chang 7-2. Sequencing revealed 169 ncRNAs, which contained 58 known and 111 novel ncRNAs (including 70 snoRNAs, 27 snRNAs, 13 unclassified ncRNAs and one tRNA). Forty of the novel ncRNAs were specific to the Panicoideae, and 24% of them are located on sense-strand of the 5' or 3' terminus of protein coding genes on chromosome. Target site analysis found that 22 snoRNAs can guide to 38 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation modification sites of ribosomal RNAs and small nuclear RNAs. Expression analysis showed that 43 ncRNAs exhibited significantly altered expression in different tissues or developmental stages of maize seedlings, eight ncRNAs had tissue-specific expression and five ncRNAs were strictly accumulated in the early stage of leaf development. Further analysis showed that 3 of the 5 stage-specific ncRNAs (Zm-3, Zm-18, and Zm-73) can be highly induced under drought and salt stress, while one snoRNA Zm-8 can be repressed under PEG-simulated drought condition. CONCLUSIONS:We provided a genome-wide identification and functional analysis of ncRNAs with a size range of 50-500 nt in maize. 111 novel ncRNAs were cloned and 40 ncRNAs were determined to be specific to Panicoideae. 43 ncRNAs changed significantly during maize development, three ncRNAs can be strongly induced under drought and salt stress, suggesting their roles in maize stress response. This work set a foundation for further study of intermediate-size ncRNAs in maize."
