    "Grain number per panicle is a major component of rice yield that is typically controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The identification of genes controlling grain number per panicle in rice would be valuable for the breeding of high-yielding rice. The Oryza glaberrima chromosome segment substitution line 9IL188 had significantly smaller panicles compared with the recurrent parent 9311. QTL analysis in an F2 population derived from a cross between 9IL188 and 9311 revealed that qgnp7(t), a major QTL located on the short arm of chromosome 7, was responsible for this phenotypic variation. Fine mapping was conducted using a large F3 population containing 2250 individuals that were derived from the F2 heterozygous plants. Additionally, plant height, panicle length, and grain number per panicle of the key F4 recombinant families were examined. Through two-step substitution mapping, qgnp7(t) was finally localized to a 41 kb interval in which eight annotated genes were identified according to available sequence annotation databases. Phenotypic evaluation of near isogenic lines (NIL-qgnp7 and NIL-qGNP7) indicated that qgnp7(t) has pleiotropic effects on rice plant architecture and panicle structure. In addition, yield estimation of NILs indicated that qGNP7(t) derived from 9311 is the favorable allele. Our results provide a foundation for isolating qgnp7(t). Markers flanking this QTL will be a useful tool for the marker-assisted selection of favorable alleles in O. glaberrima improvement programs."
