    "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors occupy a growing place in the drugs used for the management of type 2 diabetes. Recently, food components, including food-derived bioactive peptides, have been suggested as sources of DPP-IV inhibitors without side effects. Chinese black tea is a traditional health beverage, and it was used for finding DPP-IV inhibitory peptides in this study. The ultra-filtrated fractions isolated from the aqueous extracts of black tea revealed DPP-IV inhibitory activity in vitro. Four peptides under 1 kDa were identified by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry) from the ultra-filtrate. The peptide II (sequence: AGFAGDDAPR), with a molecular mass of 976 Da, showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity (in vitro) among the four peptides. After administration of peptide II (400 mg/day) for 57 days to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic mice, the concentration of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the blood increased from 9.85 ± 1.96 pmol/L to 19.22 ± 6.79 pmol/L, and the insulin level was increased 4.3-fold compared to that in STZ control mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed the improved function of pancreatic beta-cells and suppressed proliferation of pancreatic alpha-cells. This study provides new insight into the use of black tea as a potential resource of food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides for the management of type 2 diabetes."
