    "Light is an important factor that affects the synthesis of functional metabolites in longan embryogenic calli (ECs). However, analysis of the effect of light on functional metabolites in longan ECs via RNA sequencing has rarely been reported and their light regulation network is unclear. The contents of various functional metabolites as well as the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase and the level of H₂O₂ in longan ECs were significantly higher under blue light treatment than under the other treatments (dark, white). In this study, we sequenced three mRNA libraries constructed from longan ECs subjected to different treatments. A total of 4463, 1639 and 1806 genes were differentially expressed in the dark versus blue (DB), dark versus white (DW) and white versus blue (WB) combinations, respectively. According to GO and KEGG analyses, most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified were involved in transmembrane transport, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, calcium transport and so forth. Mapman analysis revealed that more DEGs were identified in each DB combination pathway than in DW combination pathways, indicating that blue light exerts a significantly stronger regulatory effect on longan EC metabolism than the other treatments. Based on previous research and transcriptome data mining, a blue light signaling network of genes that affect longan functional metabolites was constructed and HY5, PIF4 and MYC2 were shown to be the key regulatory genes in the network. The results of this study demonstrate that the expression levels of phase-specific genes vary with changes in longan EC functional metabolites."
