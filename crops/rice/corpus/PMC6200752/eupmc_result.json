    "This study was aimed at unravelling the molecular basis of root growth behavior in a drought-tolerant upland rice genotype, Nootripathu. Root tips of Nootripathu were found to possess shorter root caps and a greater number of dividing cells, favoring faster elongation compared to shallow-rooted IR20. Width and length of cortical cells in the roots of rapidly growing Nootripathu were found to be two to three times higher than IR20. Evaluation of shallow-rooted IR20, deep-rooted Nootripathu and their Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) for root characteristics revealed the presence of genetic variation for root traits among RILs. 2D-PAGE analysis of proteins in roots of IR20, Nootripathu and bulks of extreme RILs differing in root traits resulted in the identification of proteins co-segregating with root growth behavior and co-localized with QTLs for root traits. A putative candidate gene, OsARD4, encoding an \"acireductone dioxygenase\" was validated for its role in modulating the root growth pattern through genetic transformation. Transgenic ASD16 rice plants engineered for the overexpression of OsARD4 exhibited root growth characteristics similar to those of Nootripathu, including faster radical emergence, more rapid elongation of primary roots, early initiation of crown/lateral roots, and higher root biomass than the non-transgenic plants."
