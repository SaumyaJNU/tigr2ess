Attempts to improve the salt tolerance of Asian rice, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>&#x02014;the most salt sensitive of the major cereal crops&#x02014;have met with limited success, due to the complexity of the trait and finite variation in salt responses among <italic>O. sativa</italic> lines. Naturally occurring variation among the more than 20 wild species of the <italic>Oryza</italic> genus has great potential to provide breeders with novel genes to improve resistance to salt. Here, through two distinct screening experiments, we investigated variation in salinity tolerance among accessions of two wild rice species endemic to Australia, <italic>O. meridionalis</italic> and <italic>O. australiensis</italic>, with <italic>O. sativa</italic> cultivars Pokkali and IR29 providing salt-tolerant and sensitive controls, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Rice plants were grown on soil supplemented with field-relevant concentrations of NaCl (0, 40, 80, and 100&#x02009;mM) for 30 d, a period sufficient to reveal differences in growth and physiological traits. Two complementary screening approaches were used: destructive phenotyping and high-throughput image-based phenotyping. All genotypes displayed clear responses to salt treatment. In the first experiment, both salt-tolerant Pokkali and an <italic>O. australiensis</italic> accession (<italic>Oa</italic>-VR) showed the least reduction in biomass accumulation, SES score and chlorophyll content in response to salinity. Average shoot Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> values of these plants were the lowest among the genotypes tested. In the second experiment, plant responses to different levels of salt stress were quantified over time based on projected shoot area calculated from visible red-green-blue (RGB) and fluorescence images. Pokkali grew significantly faster than the other genotypes. Pokkali and <italic>Oa</italic>-VR plants displayed the same absolute growth rate under 80 and 100&#x02009;mM, while <italic>Oa</italic>-D grew significantly slower with the same treatments. <italic>Oa</italic>-VR showed substantially less inhibition of growth in response to salinity when compared with <italic>Oa</italic>-D. Senescence was seen in <italic>Oa</italic>-D after 30 d treatment with 40&#x02009;mM NaCl, while the putatively salt-tolerant <italic>Oa</italic>-VR had only minor leaf damage, even at higher salt treatments, with less than a 40% increase in relative senescence at 100&#x02009;mM NaCl compared to 120% for <italic>Oa</italic>-VR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The combination of our two screening experiments uncovered striking levels of salt tolerance diversity among the Australian wild rice accessions tested and enabled analysis of their growth responses to a range of salt levels.

Accumulation of toxic levels of salt as well as osmotic stress constitute a major threat to rice production worldwide, particularly in coastal rice-growing regions. Modern rice hybrids are some of the most salt-sensitive genotypes (Grattan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>; Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>; Qadir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>), with yield reductions evident above 30&#x02009;mM NaCl (Ismail and Horie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>) and survival of salt-sensitive genotypes compromised at 70&#x02009;mM NaCl (Yeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1990</xref>). Rice is particularly vulnerable to salinity during the early seedling and reproductive stages (Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2002</xref>). The impact of salinity will be further exacerbated by factors such as marine inundation (Takagi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>). This has vast implications for food security because rice is the staple for much of Asia (Khush <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>) and throughout pantropical countries.</p><p id="Par25">The basis of salt tolerance is polygenic, determined by a complex network of interactions involving signalling, stress-induced gene expression and membrane transporters (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2003</xref>). This complexity has complicated the search for physiological salt tolerance in rice because genotypes with tolerance in one trait are often intolerant in another (Yeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1990</xref>). Moreover, different developmental phases are characterised by distinct salt-tolerance mechanisms (Munns and Tester <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>), requiring breeding for genotypes with a suite of morphological, physiological and metabolic responses. Attempts to improve the salt tolerance of <italic>O. sativa</italic> have met with limited success due to these complexities as well as the interaction with nutritional factors, heterogeneity of field sites and other environmental factors such as heat and periodic drought (Flowers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>; Yeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1990</xref>). Notwithstanding, the improvement of salt tolerance of rice at the seedling stage is a major breeding goal in many Asian countries, where seedlings must often establish in soils already contaminated by salt. While other crops might be better suited to salt-affected soils, few are suitable alternatives to rice because of its unique ability to grow when flooded.</p><p id="Par26">Even though <italic>O. sativa</italic> represents less than 20% of the genetic diversity that exists in the 27 <italic>Oryza</italic> species (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2007</xref>; Stein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2018</xref>), there is still substantial variability in the tolerance to NaCl within this species (Gregorio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1993</xref>; Lutts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1995</xref>; Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>). In <italic>O. sativa</italic>, transport of Na<sup>+</sup> to the shoot is a major determinant of salt tolerance (Yeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1987</xref>; Yadav et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1996</xref>; Ochiai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2002</xref>). The activity of a vacuolar antiporter was found to increase salt tolerance (Fukuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). More recently, a novel quantitative trait locus (QTL) named <italic>Saltol</italic> was found to encode a trans-membrane protein, OsHKT1;5, which regulates K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis under salt stress, increasing tolerance to salt (Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2005</xref>; Thomson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>). Additional studies have identified other QTL and mutations for salt tolerance within <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Lang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>; Yao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2005</xref>; Sabouri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2008</xref>; Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>; Takagi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>) but the mechanisms of the proteins encoded in these loci are yet to be revealed.</p><p id="Par27">The diversity of wild rice relatives would suggest that a novel salt-tolerance mechanism for rice breeding programs should come from the examination of <italic>Oryza</italic> species from natural populations, of which four are indigenous to Australia: <italic>O. meridionalis, O. officinalis, O. rufipogon</italic> and <italic>O. australiensis</italic> (Henry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>; Atwell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). While the best evidence thus far for the ability of <italic>Oryza</italic> species to contribute stress-tolerance genes is the case of resistance to brown leaf hopper (Khush <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1997</xref>; Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>), abiotic factors have been powerful selective forces on these species in northern Australia, encouraging our search for tolerance to physical constraints on growth. For example, <italic>O. meridionalis</italic> and <italic>O. australiensis</italic> have superior heat tolerance compared with <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Scafaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>) with the wild allelic form of the Rubisco activase gene responsible for this trait in <italic>O. australiensis</italic> (Scafaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Although the Australian endemic rices are poorly characterised, trials demonstrate the potential of using wild rice species introgressions to enhance the growth of <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Ballini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). A recent study showed that Australia may be a centre of origin and segregation of the AA genome of <italic>Oryza</italic> and underlined the wide genetic diversity within the <italic>Oryza</italic> species that share this genome (Brozynska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). Further diversity could be expected in the phylogenetic outlier <italic>O. australiensis</italic>, which is the sole species with an EE genome (Jacquemin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>). The discovery of many domesticated alleles within the wild species reinforces the hypothesis that wild relatives are a key asset for crop improvement (Brozynska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">Over recent years, several studies in cereals and legumes have utilised high-throughput phenotyping technology under controlled environments to gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture and the physiological processes associated with salinity stress (Hairmansis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>; Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>; Atieno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). However, this approach had not been applied to crop wild relatives. In a large-scale, non-destructive phenotyping facility (&#x02018;The Plant Accelerator&#x02019;) we assembled shoot images of <italic>O. sativa</italic>, <italic>O. meridionalis</italic> and <italic>O. australiensis</italic> exposed to a range of salt treatments for five weeks during the early vegetative stage. We sought to examine developmentally specific salinity responses, growth dynamics and the complex relationship between different traits under salt stress in Australian wild rices pre-selected for inherent tolerance to salinity. Comparisons were made between these genotypes and <italic>O. sativa</italic> genotypes Pokkali (salt-tolerant) and IR29 (salt-sensitive). The broader context of this work was to gain insights into abiotic stress tolerance of exotic Australian genotypes with the aim of identifying key genes in subsequent research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material, growth conditions and salt treatments</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experiment 1</title><p id="Par30">Five wild accessions chosen from two Australian endemic wild rice species, <italic>O. meridionalis</italic> and <italic>O. australiensis</italic>, were tested along with two cultivated varieties of <italic>O. sativa</italic>, Pokkali and IR29. The wild accessions were selected from a wide range of sites, including transiently saline waterways in the north and northwest of Australia. Approximately 30 genotypes were screened for symptoms and survival in preliminary experiments (unpublished data), exhibiting a wide spectrum of tolerance to 25&#x02013;100&#x02009;mM NaCl over a four-week treatment.</p><p id="Par31">The initial testing led to a narrower selection of genotypes screened at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia (lat. 33.7&#x000b0; S, long. 151.1&#x000b0; E) in spring 2016. Seeds were de-hulled and surface-sterilised by successive immersion in water (30&#x02009;min), 4% commercial bleach (30&#x02009;min) and at least five rinses with diH<sub>2</sub>O. Seedlings were then germinated in petri dishes in the dark at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (<italic>O. sativa</italic>) and 36&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (wild rice) and grown for a further 5 d at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. After 8 d, two to four seedlings per genotype were sown in a 1.5-L polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pot (with drainage holes) containing 1.3&#x02009;L of locally sourced clay-loam, slow-release fertiliser (Nutricote Standard Blue, Yates, 0.04%) and placed in the greenhouse. Seedlings were thinned, leaving one uniformly sized and healthy seedling in each pot 15 d after transplanting (DAT).</p><p id="Par32">Salt treatments were applied to the top of the pots gradually in three stages from 25 DAT (25, up to 40 and up to 80&#x02009;mM daily increments).

Plants were watered once a day with ~&#x02009;50&#x02009;mL per pot of their respective salt concentration (including&#x000a0;0.4&#x02009;g&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> of Aquasol Soluble Fertiliser, Yates). A square aluminum tray was placed under each set of treatment pots and the drainage was collected every 3 d.

The holes in the pots allowed for the infiltration of salt solution into the soil through capillary action. The water level was maintained constant by weighing each plant and watering to a target volume of 600&#x02009;mL.

However, in our experiment, some plants attained a physical height exceeding that of the field of view of the RGB camera (the RGB camera was closer to the plants than the fluorescence camera). Thus, we chose to use the projected shoot area (PSA) based on RGB images at the beginning of the experiment (DAS 4&#x02013;19) and PSA based on fluorescence at the end (DAS 20 onwards). For the RGB images, PSA is the sum of the areas as measured (in kilopixels) from two side views at an angular separation of 90 degrees and a view from above; for the fluorescent images, PSA is the sum of the areas as measured (in kilopixels) from two side views at an angular separation of 90 degrees.</p><p id="Par44">Consequently, a hybrid PSA trait was calculated using the RGB images for DAS 4&#x02013;19 and the FLUO images for DAS 20 onwards. The PSA data from the FLUO images were transformed using the linear relationship between PSA from the RGB images and PSA from the FLUO images (for DAS 20). The conversion was made on the raw observations and then the new data were prepared for each plant as described below. Water levels were monitored and adjusted daily by the Scanalyzer 3D weighing and watering system (LemnaTec GmbH, Aachen, Germany), with pot weight before and after watering being recorded.</p><p id="Par45">To screen for osmotic tolerance, plant growth rate after the addition of NaCl was determined using the hybrid PSA trait from DAS 2 to 30, where DAS 0 corresponded to the commencement of the salt treatments to generate the PSA of the plant. The results of the high-throughput screening focused on PSA and the absolute growth rate (AGR) and relative growth rate (RGR) derived for these plants. The traits were obtained as described (Al-Tamimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). The PSA AGR and PSA RGR were calculated from the PSA values by determining the difference between consecutive PSA and ln(PSA) values, respectively, and dividing by the time difference. Similarly, the daily water loss from each pot was obtained by subtracting the weight before watering in the current imaging day from the weight after watering on the previous imaging day. The PSA water use index (WUI) was calculated daily by dividing the PSA AGR by the water use. On the one occasion that water use values were negative due to leakage from a storm, values were replaced with blank values to avoid affecting the smoothed spline curve fitting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data preparation and statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>First experiment</title><p id="Par46">Statistical significance of phenotypic traits was determined by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD multiple comparison with significant values of <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01.

PSA AGR and the PSA RGR were derived by fitting natural cubic smoothing splines to the data for each plant with different settings of the smoothing parameter degrees of freedom (df) (Al-Tamimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>). A df value of five was chosen, as it gave the most satisfactory results over all three traits. The water use rate was also smoothed by fitting a spline using df&#x02009;=&#x02009;5. After examination of the plots for the smoothed traits sPSA, sPSA AGR and sPSA RGR, we decided to investigate growth for six DAS endpoints (DAS 4, 9, 14, 19, 23 and 28) and thus the response of the rice plants to salt treatment was separated into five corresponding intervals.</p><p id="Par48">Correlation analysis was performed on the biomass-related metrics (smoothed PSA 28 and 30 DAS) and manual measurements of SFW and SDW.

In the first experiment, salt tolerance in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR was evident after 25 d of 80&#x02009;mM NaCl, where shoot biomass was reduced by 58% in Pokkali compared with controls, while the reduction in biomass in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR was marginally less (50%). Moreover, symptoms of leaf damage in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR due to NaCl were significantly less pronounced than those seen in Pokkali.</p><p id="Par64">The additional level of salt tolerance found in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR offers a potential tool for crop improvement, especially in that <italic>Oa</italic>-VR is from a wild <italic>Oryza</italic> population with the unique EE genome (Jacquemin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>), and is thus phylogenetically remote from <italic>O. sativa</italic>; this enhances the possibility of identifying novel mechanisms of salt tolerance unique to <italic>O. australiensis</italic>. By contrast, IR29 is reputedly highly salt-sensitive (Martinez-Atienza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>; Islam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). Surprisingly, for the most salt-sensitive of the wild rice genotypes (<italic>Oa</italic>-D and <italic>Oa</italic>-KR) in very moderate salinity (40&#x02009;mM NaCl), biomass and ion concentrations were more strongly affected by salt than leaf symptoms, possibly indicating genotypic variation in tissue tolerance to NaCl, as reported earlier (Yeo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1990</xref>). In reverse, the very slow absolute growth rates of IR29 appeared, paradoxically, to result in a small effect of salt on relative growth rates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) but much larger effects on senescence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This suggests that a range of performance criteria is essential to distinguish the intrinsic differences in salt tolerances in screening experiments. This underlines the polygenic nature of salt tolerance, where genes determining ion import, compartmentation and metabolic responses to salt are likely to play a collective role in physiological tolerance (Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>). Therefore, based on the overall indicators of salt tolerance and rates of shoot development, <italic>Oa</italic>-VR and <italic>Oa</italic>-D were chosen as complementary <italic>O. australiensis</italic> genotypes for image analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), representing contrasting tolerance to salt in otherwise indistinguishable <italic>O. australiensis</italic> accessions. While the salt-tolerant genotype (<italic>Oa</italic>-VR) is from the Northern Territory and the salt-sensitive accession is from the Kimberley region of Western Australia, there is no obvious basis for predicting their respective tolerances to salinity without a fine-scale investigation of the collection sites and the seasonal fluctuations in soil water content and soil chemistry.</p><p id="Par65">The rate at which shoot growth responded to salt (Experiment 2), as well as the internal Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations of young leaves (Experiment 1), provide insights into possible mechanisms of tolerance. In rice, only part of the Na<sup>+</sup> load reaching the leaves is taken up symplastically by the roots (Krishnamurthy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>), entering the transpiration stream and further regulated under the control of a suite of transporters. The low Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios found in both <italic>Oa</italic>-VR and Pokkali (&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.5) suggest that active mechanisms are in play to exclude Na<sup>+</sup>, even when the external solution was fixed at 80&#x02009;mM NaCl for 30 d. Early clues as to how this is achieved came from a QTL (Ren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2005</xref>), now known to contain the OsHKT1;5 gene, which enhances Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion in rice (Hauser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Davenport et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>) and others have established that the HKT1 transporters in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> retrieve Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem. In general, high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake systems have now been shown to be pivotal for the management of salinity and deficiency symptoms in rice (Suzuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>), as well as other species such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and wheat (Byrt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>; Hauser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). Further candidates such as the SOS1 transporter might also play a key part in the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem stream (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2002</xref>). The complexity of the rice HKT transporters identified in <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Garciadebl&#x000e1;s et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>) has not yet been explored in a wider range of <italic>Oryza</italic> genetic backgrounds. The levels of tolerance reported for <italic>O. australiensis</italic> should stimulate an analysis of the expression of genes regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> transport and the functional properties of these transporters, which may have evolved in lineages of geographically isolated communities from the Australian savannah.</p><p id="Par66">Sodium exclusion appeared to operate effectively in Pokkali and <italic>Oa</italic>-VR but failed in other wild rice accessions where Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exceeded 2.0 in the most severe cases at 80&#x02009;mM NaCl. An earlier study reported leaf Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios of 4.4 in 21 <italic>indica</italic> rice lines after 48 d of about 35&#x02009;mM NaCl (Asch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>), reinforcing the view that <italic>Oa</italic>-VR is tolerant to salt. Supporting this claim, Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in Pokkali and <italic>Oa</italic>-VR calculated on a tissue-water basis were half those in the external solution when the roots were in an 80&#x02009;mM solution. These contrasting degrees of Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion and the consequences for plant performance are illustrated by the strong relationship between ST and the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Based on the observation that diminished apoplastic uptake of Na<sup>+</sup> in the roots of Pokkali (Krishnamurthy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>) enhances Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion, the degree of bypass flow in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR and the other genotypes in the current study is a priority for identifying the mechanism of salt tolerance. The consequences of Na<sup>+</sup> loads in leaves for shoot physiology (SES, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis and tiller development) was apparent for the wild <italic>Oryza</italic> species as well as the two <italic>O. sativa</italic> standard genotypes, with strong correlations between ion levels and leaf damage.</p><p id="Par67">In the second experiment, relative growth rates could be observed continuously and non-destructively, revealing an impact of salt even in the first 4 DAS (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> Figure S3). A binary impact of salt on plants is exerted through osmotic stress and ion toxicity (Greenway and Munns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1980</xref>). The long-term impact of salt in this 30-d salt treatment was primarily due to toxic effects of Na<sup>+</sup> rather than osmotic stress, which would have been most apparent in the earliest stages of the treatment period when tissue ion levels were lowest and osmotic adjustment was not yet established (Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>). The more salt-sensitive genotypes appeared to have less capacity to exclude salt, causing leaf Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations to rise above parity and cause toxicity and metabolic impairment.</p><p id="Par68">Water use efficiency was substantially greater in <italic>Oa</italic>-VR than <italic>Oa</italic>-D, particularly in the first two weeks after salt was applied, suggesting that the resilience of photosynthesis observed in salt-treated <italic>Oa</italic>-VR plants sustained growth (PSA) even as stomatal conductance fell by 60%. WUI values for <italic>Oa</italic>-D plants at 100&#x02009;mM NaCl were notably lower than those at 40 and 80&#x02009;mM NaCl, reflecting the progressively higher impact of NaCl on hydraulics in this sensitive genotype as concentrations increased from 40 to 100&#x02009;mM NaCl. This trend of low WUI in salt-treated plants is consistent with previous studies of <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>aus</italic> rice (Al-Tamimi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>), as well as barley and wheat (Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par69">The effects of salt are dynamic, depending both upon relative growth rates and ion delivery and root:shoot ratios (Munns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>). Non-destructive measurements of growth showed that the relationship between control and salt-treated plants varied substantially over the time-course of treatment in all genotypes. This was partly due to the different developmental programs of each genotype, with Pokkali characterised by vigorous early growth and an early transition to flowering in non-saline conditions, when vegetative growth arrested; the transition to flowering was delayed in salt-treated plants. Such developmental effects are likely to be a factor in the impact of salinity on yield (Khatun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>). Among the wild rices, we have observed strong contrasts in photoperiod sensitivity between accessions, resulting in large differences in duration of vegetative growth. We speculate that this would affect the time-course of NaCl accumulation and its impact on biomass and grain yield.</p><p id="Par70">Under paddy and rainfed conditions, salt levels in the root medium are unlikely to remain constant as they did in the treatment regime applied in the first experiment. This variation in salt load was better represented in the Plant Accelerator (Experiment 2), where soil was salinised and then transpired water replaced with fresh water to the soil surface daily. We contend that these contrasting regimes of salt application mimicked both steady-state and transient salinisation, including the salt loads imposed on rice paddies following spasmodic tidal surges. The ranking of salt-tolerance for both the <italic>O. sativa</italic> &#x02018;standard&#x02019; genotypes and the four wild rice relatives was broadly maintained under the two experimental regimes we employed.</p><p id="Par71">In this study, we explored the naturally occurring variation in salt tolerance among some of rice&#x02019;s wild relatives in comparisons to selected <italic>O. sativa</italic> cultivars. Despite the substantial genetic distance between <italic>O. australiensis</italic> (taxon E) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (taxon A), several studies have managed to leap this species barrier, allowing these two species to be crossed (Morinaga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1960</xref>; Nezu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1960</xref>). Another study reported a rapid phenotype recovery of the recurrent parent after only two backcrosses (Multani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1994</xref>). Using this backcrossing approach, <italic>O. australiensis</italic> accessions have been used in breeding programs as a source of tolerance to biotic stresses including bacterial blight resistance (Brar and Khush <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1997</xref>), brown planthopper resistance (Jena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>) and blast resistance (Jeung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>; Suh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>). Our study highlights the potential use of the Australian wild-species alleles in breeding programs to exploit variations in abiotic stress generally and salinity tolerance in particular. However, harnessing alleles from wild relatives of rice that confer salt tolerance and applying them to modern cultivars remains a long-term objective until mechanisms of tolerance become clearer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
