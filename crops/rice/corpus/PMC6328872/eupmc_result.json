    "Complex plant tissues vary in hardness, i.e. some are succulent, while others are complex to break. Besides, plant metabolites, such as polysaccharides, proteins, polyphenols and lipids, can greatly interfere with the RNA extraction. So, in order to obtain a high-quality RNA from the complex tissues (like coconut endosperm, coconut apple and coconut leaf bud) rich in secondary metabolites, a robust method is demanded. Several methods (MRIP, CTAB and TRIZOL) have been used previously for the isolation of quality RNA from the coconut tissues, but without any success. The present study will provide with the details of a new method (Quick and Reliable RNA Extraction Method or QRREM), which have efficiently isolated the intact RNA form the complex tissues of coconut compared with CTAB, Trizol and RNA plant. The method has been validated for the isolation of high-quality intact RNA from the other available plant species (Areca/betel nut, mint and spring onion). The method has various advantages over the other methods in terms of time and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, the resulted RNA from various tissues of coconut performed well in the downstream experiments, i.e. reverse transcription and PCR for the production and amplification of cDNA."
