In addition to a small number proteins encoded by their own genomes, the majority of mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins are encoded in the cell nucleus and imported into the organelle. As a consequence, coordination between mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the nucleus is of crucial importance to plant cells. Variegated mutants are chloroplast-defective mutants and are considered to be ideal models for studying the intercommunication between these organelles. Here, we report the isolation of <italic>WHITE PANICLE3</italic> (<italic>WP3</italic>), a nuclear gene involved in variegation, from a naturally occurring white panicle rice mutant. Disrupted expression of <italic>WP3</italic> in the mutant leads to severe developmental defects in both chloroplasts and mitochondria, and consequently causes the appearance of white-striped leaves and white panicles in the mutant plants. Further investigation showed that <italic>WP3</italic> encodes a protein most likely targeted to mitochondria and is specifically expressed in rice panicles. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the recessive white-panicle phenotype in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant is inherited in a typical Mendelian manner, while the white-striped leaf phenotype in <italic>wp3</italic> is maternally inherited. Our data collectively suggest that the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein, WP3, plays an essential role in the regulation of chloroplast development in rice panicles by maintaining functional mitochondria. Therefore, the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant is an excellent model in which to explore the communication between the nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts in plant cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>WHITE PANICLE3</italic> (<italic>WP3</italic>)</kwd><kwd>white stripe</kwd><kwd>white panicle</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In plant cells, chloroplasts and mitochondria are regarded as interdependent organelles due to their complex metabolic connections, such as metabolism, energy status, and reduction/ oxidation (redox) status (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Raghavendra and Padmasree, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">van Lis and Atteia, 2004</xref>). Fine-level coordination between chloroplasts and mitochondria, namely chloroplast-mitochondria cross-talk, is therefore essential for the proper functioning and survival of plant cells. At present, genetic studies in various plant species have demonstrated the existence and importance of chloroplast-mitochondria cross-talk in the development of these organelles. First, functional disruption of mitochondria causes developmental defects in chloroplast. In potato, a reduction in the amount of P-protein, one of the subunits of mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase, leads to decreases in both photosynthetic and growth rates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Heineke et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, defects in the barley mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex also result in chloroplast over-reduction and over-energization (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Sabar et al., 2000</xref>). In turn, the damaged chloroplasts also affect mitochondrial development. In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, delivery of chloroplast tRNAs to mitochondria has been demonstrated to be critical for protein synthesis in mitochondria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bennoun and Delosme, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In addition to cross-talk between chloroplasts and mitochondria, nuclear genes are also largely involved in the development of these organelles (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Pennazio, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Pogson and Albrecht, 2011</xref>). To date, a number of nuclear genes that are involved in either chloroplast or mitochondrial developmental processes have been isolated. Most of these genes encode proteins that are targeted to these two organelles and function in multiple processes, including gene transcription, protein synthesis, enzyme activation, metabolite production, and electron transport chain maintenance (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barkan and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Woodson and Chory, 2008</xref>). Due to the critical importance of chloroplasts and mitochondria in bio-energetics and their roles in the synthesis of many cellular metabolites, tight coordination between the nucleus and these cytoplasmic organelles is essential for the survival and proper functioning of plant cells.</p><p>Variegated plants are defined as a category of mutants which display white or yellow sectors in plant green tissues such as leaves and stems. In particular, the variegation observed in monocotyledonous plants is sometimes referred to as striping (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto, 2003</xref>). A number of studies have demonstrated that most variegation is caused by chloroplast or mitochondrial defects, and the majority of these types of mutants arise from mutations in the nuclear genome (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aluru et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). Variegated mutants therefore provide ideal models for studying the intercommunication between the nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria in plant cells. In the past two decades, a number of genes related to variegated leaf mutants have been identified, and most of these genes are located in the nucleus and encode proteins targeted to the chloroplasts or mitochondria. Thus, mutations within these genes generally lead to obvious developmental defects in chloroplasts or mitochondria. <italic>Immutans</italic> (<italic>im</italic>) is a variegated mutant isolated in Arabidopsis. Molecular studies show that the <italic>IM</italic> gene encodes a plastid terminal oxidase and functions as a terminal oxidase by transferring electrons from the plastoquinol pool to molecular oxygen. Mutation in <italic>IM</italic> gene results in the production of reactive oxygen and therefore causes the formation of photooxidized plastids in the white sectors of <italic>im</italic> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Carol and Kuntz, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rosso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Foudree et al., 2012</xref>). Two other variegated mutants that have been extensively investigated in Arabidopsis are <italic>var1</italic> (<italic>variegation mutant 1</italic>) and <italic>var2</italic> (<italic>variegation mutant 2</italic>). Studies on these two mutants indicate that both the VAR1 and VAR2 proteins play critical roles in chloroplast thylakoid membrane protein degradation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Miura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rosso et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to those genes that play essential roles in the chloroplast, several genes related to mitochondrial development have also been isolated from variegated mutants. Arabidopsis <italic>CHM</italic> (<italic>chloroplast mutator</italic>) is an example of one of these genes. Extensive studies show that <italic>CHM</italic> encodes a mitochondrion-targeted protein that is required for maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial DNA molecules (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdelnoor et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Quesada et al. (2011)</xref> described an Arabidopsis mutant <italic>rugosa2</italic> (<italic>rug2</italic>) that displays pale green leaf sectors. The cloned <italic>RUG2</italic> gene was shown to encode a mitochondria and chloroplast dual-targeted protein that shows homology with metazoan mitochondrial transcription termination factors. Further study indicated that <italic>RUG2</italic> plays a role in modulating transcription of <italic>RpoTp</italic>, which encodes a chloroplast RNA polymerase, and thereby controls chloroplast development. Unlike the mutants mentioned above, in which the variegated phenotypes arise from mutations in the nuclear genome, mutations in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also frequently cause variegation. Maize non-chromosomal stripe (NCS) mutants are a series of typical mutants that result from specific DNA deletions in the mitochondrial genome. Deep explorations of these mutants showed that mitochondria DNA deletions in the NCS mutants leads to assembly defects in the mitochondrial respiratory complex (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Karpova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Jiao et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism through which dysfunctional mitochondria affect chloroplast development in the NCS mutants is unclear at present.</p><p>To study the mechanism of chloroplast development in grasses, we focused our attention on rice stripe mutants. In our previous study, we identified a naturally occurring rice mutant, which exhibits white panicles and white-striped leaves, in the progeny of an <italic>indica</italic>-<italic>japonica</italic> cross (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>). Because this mutant showed very similar characteristics to two previously characterized rice mutants, <italic>wp1</italic> (<italic>white panicle1</italic>) and <italic>wp2</italic> (<italic>white panicle2</italic>) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez and Khush, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), we named it <italic>white panicle3</italic> (<italic>wp3</italic>). Preliminary genetic analysis indicated that a mutation located on rice chromosome 1 may account for the white panicles in this mutant (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>). In our current study, we performed more detailed analyses of the mutant by using various approaches, including histology, electron microscopy, a map-based cloning strategy, and bioinformatics. Eventually, we showed that the <italic>WP3</italic> gene encodes a novel mitochondrial protein that is functionally disrupted in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant by a retrotransposon insertion within the gene promoter. Histological and microscopic analyses demonstrated that the disrupted expression of <italic>WP3</italic> leads to severe mitochondrial and chloroplast developmental defects in the mutant panicles. Our study provides novel insights into the way that nuclear genes are involved in the regulation of chloroplast and mitochondrial development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phenotypes of the Rice <italic>white panicle3</italic> (<italic>wp3</italic>) Mutant</title><p>We first performed detailed phenotypic analyses of rice <italic>white panicle3</italic> (<italic>wp3</italic>) mutant plants. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>, the mutant exhibits prominent milk-white colored panicles and rachises at the flowering stage, in contrast to the wild type plant in which the panicles and rachises are light green. Moreover, we noticed that the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants also have white-striped leaves, and it is interesting that the white stripes mostly appear on basal tiller leaves (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref></bold>). To fully explore the development of the striped-leaf character in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, we next examined <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants at various growth stages. In the germination phase of the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, most seedlings show white stripes on the leaves, while a portion of them (404 out of a total of 1448 seedlings) are albinos. All of the albino plants grew until the L3 stage before they died, whereas the other mutant plants survive but produce severe white-striped leaves prior to the L4 or L5 stage (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref></bold>). At the tillering stage, striped leaves are only occasionally observed at this late stage of development, mostly involving the first four or five tiller leaves of mutant plants. Furthermore, we observed that white sectors are not confined to restricted areas, but are widely distributed over the entire leaf surface, including the petiole. In addition, we found that the extent of variegation differs greatly among the individual mutant plants. Even in a single <italic>wp3</italic> plant, leaves with different degrees and patterns of variegation, including green, slightly striped, heavily striped, and totally white are observed.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Phenotypic and genetic analysis of <italic>wp3</italic> mutant. <bold>(A)</bold> Representative images of wild-type (left) and <italic>wp3</italic> (right) panicles.

To test whether the white-striped leaves in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant are sensitive to these environmental changes, wild type and <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants were grown under various temperatures (22, 28, and 32&#x000b0;C) or were exposed to different light intensities (500, 1000, and 1500 &#x003bc;mol quanta m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). Based on our examination, no dramatic phenotypic differences were observed in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants compared to wild type as a result of these treatments, indicating that the generation of white stripes in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant is independent of these environmental changes.</p></sec><sec><title>In <italic>wp3</italic> Mutant Plants, White Panicles Are Determined by a Nuclear Gene, While White Stripes Are Maternally Inherited</title><p>Variegated mutants are mostly induced by chloroplast or mitochondrial defects, and variegated sectors in these mutants are therefore maternally inherited in their offspring (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdelnoor et al., 2003</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that the white-panicle phenotype in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant is inherited in a typical Mendelian manner and is determined by a single recessive nuclear gene (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>), but the inheritance pattern of the striped-leaf phenotype was not determined. To address this, reciprocal crosses between <italic>wp3</italic> and the wild type, TP309, were conducted and then subjected to genetic analysis. In F<sub>1</sub> progeny from the cross in which TP309 was the maternal parent, all individual plants showed green leaves and panicles (<italic>n</italic> = 60). In contrast, F<sub>1</sub> plants from the cross in which the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant was the maternal parent all had green panicles, but albinos (37.64%) and white-striped plants (62.36%) were detected (<italic>n</italic> = 85) during the seedling stage (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,E</xref></bold>). These data strongly suggest that white panicles and white-striped leaves in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant are inherited by the progeny in two distinct ways. In contrast to the white-panicle phenotype that is inherited in a typical Mendelian fashion as a single recessive gene, the striped-leaf phenotype is maternally inherited (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Chloroplast Development Is Blocked in the <italic>wp3</italic> Mutant</title><p>Considering that most variegated plants result from defective chloroplast development, we conducted a histological analysis to examine the chloroplasts in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants. Chloroplasts in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant showed significant defects in both morphology and biogenesis as compared to those in wild type plants (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B,G,H</xref></bold>). In the white stripes on <italic>wp3</italic> mutant leaves, chloroplast biogenesis seems to be completely blocked, because no chloroplasts with normal structures were observed in mesophyll cells (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref></bold>). A similar defect was also observed in panicle cells of <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I,J</xref></bold>). Even in green leaves of <italic>wp3</italic> plants, most chloroplasts were smaller in size and had partially developed inner membranes (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref></bold>). Moreover, in <italic>wp3</italic> green leaf cells, the numbers of chloroplasts were markedly reduced compared with those in wild type plants. On average, the wild-type leaf had &#x0223c;4.82 chloroplasts per cell section, whereas &#x0003c;2 chloroplasts were observed in each <italic>wp3</italic> leaf cell section from within green sectors. More severely, almost no chloroplasts were found in cells from either white stripes or white panicles in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2U</xref></bold>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Chloroplast developmental defects in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant. <bold>(A&#x02013;J)</bold> Histological images of cells from wild type and <italic>wp3</italic> mutant. <bold>(A&#x02013;F)</bold> Showed the chloroplast in leaf cell; <bold>(G&#x02013;J)</bold> showed the chloroplast in panicle cell. <bold>(B,D,F,H,J)</bold> Showed the enlarged images in red frames in <bold>(A,C,E,G,I)</bold>, respectively.

In wild type cells, chloroplasts were well developed with normally stacked grana and thylakoid membranes (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K,L,Q,R</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1A</xref></bold>). In the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, however, only a few smaller chloroplasts with less well developed grana were observed in green leaf cells (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M,N</xref></bold>). Within cells in the white stripe sectors, some chloroplast-like organelles were observed, but all of them had completely lost the thylakoid membrane structures (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O,P</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1B</xref></bold>), indicating that chloroplast development was significantly blocked in the mutant. We also observed that most chloroplasts in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant cells contained clear starch granules, suggesting that there are some chloroplast-related defects in starch metabolism in this mutant. All chloroplast abnormalities detected in white leaf stripe cells were also observed in white panicle cells (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S,T</xref></bold>), suggesting that the <italic>WP3</italic> gene may play similar roles in chloroplast biogenesis in both the leaf and panicle.</p><p>We then investigated the chloroplast pigment constituents in the wild type and the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant.

Rice genomic sequences show that this region contains five annotated genes, which encode five putative proteins, including a transposon, a retrotransposon, an endoribonuclease E-like protein, and two additional hypothetical proteins (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref></bold>). Considering the potential relationship between the predicted functions of these genes and the mutant phenotypes observed in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, we ruled out the two transposon proteins and retained the remaining three genes as candidates for further testing.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Map-based cloning of <italic>WP3.</italic>

We then amplified the respective promoter regions of the three pairs of candidate genes from wild type and the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant. We found that no product was obtained using genomic DNA from the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant as a template to amplify the promoter region of one of the unknown genes (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref></bold>). We subsequently performed PCR amplification using various primer pairs that target the adjacent sequences of this region, but still no expected PCR products were obtained (data not shown). Based on these results, we speculated that a long sequence insertion could be present within this region in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant genome.</p><p>Using a <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP labeled PCR product of this gene from wild type rice as a probe, we next performed Southern blot analysis and detected a band that was 4 kb larger in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant genome compared to the band found in the wild type rice genome (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref></bold>). Using TAIL-PCR and DNA sequencing, we obtained the terminal sequences of the insertion. Sequence analysis detected two typical LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) sequences in both ends of the insertion, indicating that the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant probably has a retrotransposon insertion in this region. Finally, we obtained the full sequence of the insertion using PCR and sequencing technologies (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref></bold>). Sequence analysis showed that this DNA insertion is a 4.3 kb <italic>copia</italic>-like retrotransposon located 178 bp upstream of the start codon of Os01g0306650 in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant (Rice Annotation Project Database build4<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis suggested that this retrotransposon insertion in the promoter region of <italic>Os01g0306650</italic> led to reduced gene transcription in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref></bold>). To investigate the specificity of this retrotransposon insertion in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, we examined 22 rice varieties and found that only the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, but not even one of the wild type rice varieties, contains this specific insertion (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref></bold>). Accordingly, we considered <italic>Os01g0306650</italic> the most likely candidate to be the <italic>WP3</italic> gene.</p><p>In order to confirm that <italic>Os01g0306650</italic> encodes <italic>WP3</italic>, we performed a complementation experiment. In brief, a 5.5 kb <italic>Eco</italic>RI-<italic>Sal</italic>I genomic DNA fragment containing the entire coding region, 3 kb upstream, and 2.3 kb downstream of the putative <italic>WP3</italic> gene was isolated from a BAC clone, inserted into the pCAMBIA1300 expression vector, and introduced into the genome of <italic>wp3</italic> plants via agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We obtained almost 50 independent transformants. Transformants carrying insertions of the DNA fragment that encodes <italic>WP3</italic> were identified using PCR. The expected amplification products for both <italic>HygR</italic> (<italic>hygromycin B phosphotransferase</italic>) and <italic>WP3</italic> were obtained from all 50 transformants, indicating that all transformants were positive for the transgene (<bold>Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref></bold>). Subsequent phenotypic analysis showed that all transformants had green panicles, suggesting that <italic>Os01g0306650</italic> is <italic>WP3</italic> (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref></bold>). Unexpectedly, all transformants still exhibited white-striped leaves. Because chloroplasts are inherited from the mother plant, we thus speculate that the white stripes present on leaves of T<sub>0</sub>-generation transformant plants could be attributed to maternally inherited chloroplast defects from the mutant plants that were used as the receptor in the complementation test. If this is the case, the white stripes should be rescued in following generations from these transformants, since all transformants had green-colored panicles. Indeed, we observed that the number of plants with white-striped leaves was dramatically reduced in the subsequent T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> generations derived from these transformants (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref></bold>). While all T<sub>0</sub> transformants exhibited a severe white-stripe phenotype, only about half of the T<sub>2</sub>- (77 out of 130) and T<sub>3</sub>-generation (66 out of 135) plants showed very slight striping on 1&#x02013;2 leaves (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref></bold>). We followed the recovery of leaf color through the T<sub>6</sub> generation of all transformants and found that the white-striped leaves were almost completely eliminated after the T<sub>5</sub> generation. These data collectively support the notion that <italic>WP3</italic> is directly responsible for chloroplast development in rice panicles, while white-striped leaves on the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant are a byproduct of damaged chloroplasts in the panicles.</p><p>To further understand the roles of <italic>WP3</italic> in rice chloroplast development, <italic>WP3</italic> was over-expressed in a <italic>japonica</italic> rice variety, &#x02018;Taipei 309,&#x02019; under control of the maize <italic>UBI1</italic> promoter. The T<sub>0</sub> generation of <italic>WP3</italic> over-expressing plants did not show any differences with respect to leaf and panicle color.

This finding, combined with the fact that <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants show severe chloroplast developmental defects, led us to speculate that <italic>WP3</italic> may have the capacity to improve chloroplast biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Analysis of the <italic>WP3</italic> Gene</title><p>The <italic>WP3</italic> gene consists of a single open reading frame (GenBank Accession Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="JN794567">JN794567</ext-link>) and encodes a putative protein containing 118 amino acid residues. Its N-terminal region, especially the first 22 amino acids, is enriched in hydrophobic amino acid residues and is therefore thought to be a possible signal peptide that mediates delivery to the cell membrane (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>). Southern blot analysis revealed that <italic>WP3</italic> is a single copy gene in the rice genome (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref></bold>). Unexpectedly, BLAST searches of the non-redundant protein database did not identify any orthologs of WP3. We speculate that this may be due to low levels of sequence homology of WP3 in different plant species. To further address whether the <italic>WP3</italic> gene is also present in other plant genomes, we carried out a gene collinearity analysis in all dicots and monocots with available genome sequences. We found that six monocot genomes showed similar gene collinearity surrounding the <italic>WP3</italic> locus; these included rice, the wild rice species <italic>Oryza brachyantha</italic>, sorghum, foxtail millet, <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, and maize (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref></bold>). Among these species, rice, wild rice, sorghum, and foxtail millet contain <italic>WP3</italic> homologs at the corresponding locus. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that these four <italic>WP3</italic> homologs share obvious homology within their N-terminal domains (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref></bold>), indicating the functional significance of the N-terminus. Additionally, the conserved amino acid motif was used to construct a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile. The HMM profile was then used to search against the protein databases of <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, maize, Arabidopsis, and poplar. No <italic>WP3</italic> orthologs were identified in any of these species. Together, these data suggest that <italic>WP3</italic> is a gene that is unique to monocots, and that it is also restricted to some species of monocots.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Genomic analysis of <italic>WP3</italic>. <bold>(A)</bold> Gene collinearity surrounding <italic>WP3</italic> in six monocot genomes was compared. <bold>(B)</bold> Alignment of amino acid sequences of <italic>WP3</italic> in rice and its orthologs in wild rice, sorghum, and millet. <bold>(C)</bold> Southern blot analysis of <italic>WP3</italic> in rice genome.

For this purpose, transgenic rice plants expressing the WP3-GFP fusion protein driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, were generated and used to examine the cellular localization of WP3. Unexpectedly, the WP3-GFP protein did not show any co-localization with chloroplasts in rice leaves. Rather, the green fluorescence signals showed mitochondria-like localization patterns in root cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>). To test whether <italic>WP3</italic> encodes a mitochondrial protein, we performed staining using mitotracker red, which specifically stains mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. As indicated, WP3-GFP clearly co-localized with the red mitotracker red signals in root cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). To further confirm these observations, mitochondrial fractions were isolated from cells of rice plants expressing WP3-GFP and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using antibodies as indicated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref></bold>. As expected, we detected strong GFP signals in whole cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions from transgenic plants but not in control plants. Additionally, no signals were detected in the remaining fractions that did not contain mitochondria, further confirming the unique localization of WP3 in mitochondria. In this analysis, AOX and SBPase (sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase) were used as specific mitochondrial and chloroplastic fraction indicators, respectively.

In total, seven mitochondria-related genes were selected for this experiment. Of these, four genes (<italic>AOX1a</italic>, <italic>CytC1-1</italic>, <italic>SDH</italic>, and <italic>COX1</italic>) encode proteins related to mitochondrial respiratory function, and three genes (<italic>TOM40</italic>, <italic>VDAC</italic>, and <italic>UCP1</italic>) encode channel proteins located on the mitochondrial membrane. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref></bold>, expression of two of these eight genes, <italic>AOX1a</italic> and <italic>CytC1-1</italic>, was obviously changed in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant panicles compared to wild type panicles. <italic>CytC1-1</italic> gene expression was clearly repressed, while <italic>AOX1a</italic> expression was markedly up-regulated in <italic>wp3</italic> young panicles (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref></bold>). In addition to <italic>AOX1a</italic> and <italic>CytC1-1</italic>, the other mitochondrial genes monitored in our study, including <italic>COX1</italic>, <italic>SDH</italic>, <italic>TOM40</italic>, <italic>UCP1</italic>, and <italic>VDAC</italic> showed the same expression levels in the wild type and <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants. Since both AOX1a and CytC1-1 are key components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the expression changes in these two critical genes in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant suggest that loss of WP3 function may disrupt proper assembly of the mitochondrial ETC and thereby give rise to aberrant mitochondria. We further investigated the mRNA levels of chloroplast-associated genes in seedlings of the wild type and <italic>WP3</italic> mutant plants. Among the six photosynthesis associated genes examined, the expression of <italic>RbcL, RbcS</italic>, and <italic>CAB</italic>, in which <italic>RbcL</italic> and <italic>RbcS</italic> encode the large and small subunits of chloroplast ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, respectively, and <italic>CAB</italic> encode Chlorophyll a&#x02013;b binding protein, was significantly reduced in albino sectors of <italic>wp3</italic> mutant leaves compared with wild type plants, while the expression of other three genes (<italic>RPL23</italic>, <italic>OsSigA</italic>, and <italic>OsFtsZ</italic>) was not affected (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref></bold>).

Proteomic studies have shown that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain up to several thousand gene products, including as many as 2,000&#x02013;3,000 proteins in the chloroplast and &#x0223c;1,000 proteins in the mitochondrion (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">van Wijk and Baginsky, 2011</xref>). Among these proteins, fewer than 100, however, are encoded by the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, and all the rest are supplied by genes in the plant nuclear genome (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Unseld et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 1999</xref>). Identification of nuclear genes that are involved in the development of these organelles will therefore contribute greatly to our understanding of the coordination between the nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondrion. Variegated plant mutants are defective in chloroplast developmental processes and mostly arise from mutations in nuclear or organellar genes. Thus, variegated mutants provide opportunities to explore the mechanisms by which the mitochondrion, the chloroplast, and the nucleus are tightly coordinated. In this report, we describe a rice variegated mutant, <italic>wp3</italic>, that exhibits white panicles and white-striped leaves. Using a map-based cloning approach, we isolated the mutant gene responsible for causing variegation in the leaves and panicles. Moreover, we showed that failed expression of <italic>WP3</italic> leads to severe developmental defects in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Using microscopy and biochemical analyses, we were able to demonstrate that <italic>WP3</italic> encodes a protein that localizes to the mitochondria. Based on these observations, we conclude that <italic>WP3</italic> is a nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial protein that plays critical roles during mitochondrial development. Because WP3 was not detected in chloroplasts in our study, we further propose that the chloroplast defects observed in the rice <italic>wp3</italic> mutant are most likely due to a lack of properly developed mitochondria. This is consistent with the previous finding in maize NCS mutants that damaged mitochondria also caused chloroplast developmental defects by distinct mechanisms.</p><p>In our previous study, the white-stripe phenotype in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant leaves was thoroughly described but was not analyzed genetically (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>). It seems that white-striped leaves are closely associated with white panicles in this mutant. In the current study, however, we show that white-striped leaves in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant are maternally inherited, which is distinct from white panicles that are inherited in a typical Mendelian manner. The maternal inheritance of white-striped leaves was first demonstrated by genetic analysis in reciprocal crosses between the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant and the wild type TP309. White striped leaves were only observed in F<sub>1</sub> plants when <italic>wp3</italic> was the maternal parent, but not in crosses in which <italic>wp3</italic> was the paternal parent. Moreover, in our complementation test, we observed that the T<sub>0</sub> plants all exhibited white stripes, although their white-panicle phenotypes were all rescued. We thus surmise that the leaf stripes in T<sub>0</sub> plants could result from chloroplast defects in the original plant materials that were used as the receptor in the complementation test. Indeed, we observed the rescue of the white-stripe phenotype in the subsequent T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> generations. To explain these two distinct modes of inheritance of white panicles and white-striped leaves in the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, we propose the following model based on the results of our study. Failed expression of <italic>WP3</italic> in the rice <italic>wp3</italic> mutant first leads to mitochondrial developmental defects in the panicles, and these mitochondrial defects then cause a dramatic reduction in the numbers of functional chloroplast in panicles, and very likely in ovary cells as well. In next-generation seedlings, only very few chloroplasts are inherited maternally from the mutant plants, which then results in missing chloroplasts in some cells because they physically segregate during cell division. Next, these cells without chloroplasts continuously grow, divide, and eventually form the white stripes in the leaves.</p><p>Mitochondria are mobile, dynamic organelles that constantly fuse and divide. Fine regulation of these processes is critical for mitochondrial inheritance and functional maintenance (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Here, we found out that mitochondria in the <italic>wp3</italic> rice mutant show severe defects in the dynamic morphological change process as they progress to maturation. In the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant, a large number of small round mitochondria were observed, and these mitochondria could not further develop into mature mitochondria that are elongated in shape. To explain these unusual changes, we speculate that the small mitochondria in <italic>wp3</italic> mutant plants possibly result from reduced mitochondrial fusion or accelerated mitochondrial division. Considering that the WP3-GFP fusion protein localizes to mitochondria, it is very likely that rice WP3 is targeted to the mitochondria and has essential roles in mitochondrial dynamics, including both fusion and fission, and that loss of WP3 will cause defects in these critical processes. Since <italic>WP3</italic> expression is mainly detected in young rice panicles during heading and not in other green tissues, we propose that the WP3-mediated regulation of mitochondrial function is mainly restricted to heading panicles in rice. Most likely, there is a particularly pronounced need for the WP3 protein for mitochondrial function during early, rapid cell proliferation stages of panicle development. Thus, <italic>WP3</italic> provides us with the novel insight that plant cells from distinct organs or tissues can have unique regulators to modulate the development of their mitochondria.</p><p>Because <italic>WP3</italic> was shown to play critical roles in chloroplast and mitochondria development in the rice panicle, we then hypothesized that its orthologs in other plant species may have a similar function. However, sequence analysis only identified <italic>WP3</italic> orthologs in the genomes of wild rice, sorghum, and foxtail, suggesting similar functions for <italic>WP3</italic> in these species; no <italic>WP3</italic> orthologs were identified in <italic>B. distachyon</italic>, maize, Arabidopsis, and poplar. It is possible that the function of WP3 could be replaced by other genes or pathways in those species that lack an identifiable ortholog of <italic>WP3</italic>. Alternatively, the failure to identify <italic>WP3</italic> orthologs in some species might be a result of the relative incompleteness of the current genome assembly, such as in maize.</p><p>Leaves and panicles are two physiologically different organs in the grasses. The leaf is enriched in chloroplasts, and is where photosynthesis specifically occurs, whereas the panicle is an organ involved in reproduction. Because fewer chloroplasts develop in panicle cells, chloroplasts seem to be less functional in this specific organ compared to leaves. In line with this, the role of plastids changes quickly at the heading stage when panicles are generated (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Inaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010</xref>). Thus, there must be a huge difference in plastid development between the leaf and panicle, and monocot plants may have developed some precisely controlled mechanisms to regulate chloroplast functions in their panicles. At present, little information is available about chloroplast modulation during panicle development in monocots, although many chloroplast defective mutants have been extensively studied. In this report, we identified a novel chloroplast defective mutant in rice. Unlike those mutants that mainly exhibit aberrant leaf color, such as <italic>virescent</italic> (<italic>v</italic>), <italic>stripe</italic> (<italic>st</italic>), <italic>albino, chlorina, zebra</italic>, and <italic>yellow variegated, wp3</italic> exhibits both white panicles and white-striped leaves on individual plants. Notably, the <italic>WP3</italic> gene was not transcribed in leaves, but intriguingly, was expressed exclusively in young panicles. Loss of <italic>WP3</italic> expression caused defective chloroplast development in panicles, indicating that <italic>WP3</italic> is a specific regulator of plastid development in this organ. Based on these findings, we conclude that the <italic>wp3</italic> mutant is an ideal model to explore the mechanisms by which chloroplast development is specifically regulated in rice panicles. It is interesting, as mentioned above, that the two previously known white panicle mutants, <italic>wp1</italic> and <italic>wp2</italic>, have similar phenotypes to <italic>wp3</italic>, but that their respective genetic loci are different from <italic>wp3</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez and Khush, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Therefore, further identification and eventual cloning of <italic>WP1</italic> and <italic>WP2</italic> and elucidation of the functional connections between <italic>WP1</italic>, <italic>WP2</italic>, and <italic>WP3</italic> will undoubtedly improve our understanding of how plastid development is specifically regulated in the panicle of monocotyledonous plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials</title><p><italic>White panicle3</italic> (<italic>wp3</italic>) is a naturally occurring mutant of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) derived from the F<sub>6</sub> progeny of a cross between the inbred lines &#x02018;Zhefu802&#x02019; &#x000d7; &#x02018;Xiushui11&#x02019; (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2003</xref>).
