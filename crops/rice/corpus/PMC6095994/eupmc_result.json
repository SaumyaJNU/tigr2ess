    "Rice is a pivotal cereal crop that provides the staple food for more than half of the world's population. Along with improvements in the standard of living, people not only pay attention to the grain yield but also to the grain quality. Chalkiness is one of the most important index of grain quality. In this study, qPCG1, a QTL for percentage of chalky grain, was mapped in an interval with a physical distance about 139 kb on chromosome 1 by residual heterozygous line (RHL) method. qPCG1 was incomplete dominant and the additive effect plays a major role and explained 6.8-21.9% of phenotypic variance within the heterogeneous region on chromosome 1. The effect of allele from Zhonghui9308 was decreasing the percentage of chalky grains (PCG). Microscope observation results indicated that there are great differences in the shape, structure and arrangement of starch granule between the chalky part and transparent part. Analysis of starch physicochemical properties showed that the total starch content, amylose content and chain length distribution of amylopectin changed while the protein contents were not apparently affected with the changed chalkiness. qPCG1 had little influence on main agronomic traits and it might be useful in rice breeding for it did not bring negative effect on grain yield while reducing the chalkiness."
