Imputed panels can be used to improve resolution for genome-wide association (GWA) and to integrate data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Leveraging haplotype diversity information from publicly available cosmopolitan reference panels for imputation has been widely used in human genetics research, beginning with reference panels derived from the first HapMap Projects and then from the 1000 Genomes Project as sequencing technologies improved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast to the consortium approach taken by the human genetics community, crop researchers have conventionally addressed resource development in a more distributed fashion. This may be related to the intrinsically flexible nature of plant populations; a single species can exhibit a range of mating habits and environmental adaptations, and individuals can be readily propagated. These features give rise to the many types of plant collections that are genotyped, e.g., biparental and multiparental mapping populations, locally adapted landrace collections, diversity panels, and various generations of elite breeding material. As a result, myriad genomic data sets of varying quality and density on independent collections of samples have accrued. Imputation has the potential to provide a generalized solution to enrich genomic data sets and facilitate data integration across germplasm resources, especially important for sparse data sets generated from platforms such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) or skim sequencing used commonly in plant research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Cultivated Asian rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.), the first crop genome to be fully sequenced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, has been a pioneer species in genomic research. It is rich in open-access resources, including diverse germplasm samples available as publicly available purified (homozygous) seed stocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, data sets from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array genotyping and resequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and a recent pan-genome initiative that aims to provide a union set of all genes within the species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Despite these features, there currently exists no rice data set that has been vetted to serve as a cosmopolitan reference panel for imputation and no systematic approach to facilitate integration across different resources. One of the specific challenges for the rice community is the fact that <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> is comprised of deeply differentiated subpopulations across two varietal groups (VG) due to the combined effects of natural and human selection: Indica VG: <italic>indica&#x000a0;</italic>(<italic>ind</italic>)<italic>, aus&#x000a0;</italic>(<italic>aus</italic>); Japonica VG: <italic>temperate&#x000a0;japonica</italic>(<italic>tej</italic>), <italic>tropical japonica</italic>&#x000a0;(<italic>trj</italic>)&#x000a0;and <italic>aromatic</italic>(<italic>aro</italic>). The five subpopulations are distinguishable based on ecological adaptation, grain quality characteristics, and complex physiological parameters, as well as population genetics metrics such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The most comprehensive <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> genomic data sets released to date, accompanied by publicly available germplasm, are the 3000 Rice Genomes (3KRG), genotyped using Illumina short-read next-generation resequencing technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and the Rice Diversity Panels 1 and 2, ~1500 diverse rice varieties genotyped using a genome-wide high-density rice array (HDRA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (hereafter referred to as the HDRA panel). These panels sample across the geographic and genetic space occupied by <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>&#x02019;s five distinct subpopulations. The 3KRG Project yielded a set of 29&#x02009;M biallelic SNP markers, an 18&#x02009;M base SNP set, and a 4.8&#x02009;M filtered, high-quality SNP set as part of its Release 1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp-seek.irri.org/download.zul">http://snp-seek.irri.org/download.zul</ext-link>).

We examine parameter effects on imputation in rice using IMPUTE2 and impute the HDRA Panel to 4.8&#x02009;M SNPs using 3KRG as the reference panel. We demonstrate the benefits that imputed data can provide to enhance the resolution of rice GWA studies using grain amylose content as a case study. We assemble a Rice Reference Panel (RICE-RP) by merging the HDRA and 3KRG data sets via reciprocal imputation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and develop a web-based service called the Rice Imputation Server to increase imputation accessibility to rice researchers throughout the world.

We carried out a series of experiments to investigate the parameter settings that provide the best performance in rice samples, using a gold standard set of accessions that overlapped between the HDRA and 3KRG Panels as our study panel (individuals, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50; markers, <italic>m</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;160,267) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For the reference panel, we used the 3KRG accessions but removed the 50 study panel individuals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2973; <italic>m</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,817,964) to ensure that there would be no identical samples across reference and study panels. We first assessed whether there was any difference between the use of phased and unphased reference panels. T&#x000a0;he expectation was&#x000a0;that there should be no difference in accuracy due to <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> being an inbreeding species such that genotypes are generally equivalent to haplotypes. To test this, we targeted three 2-Mb segments across the genome (regions on chr 1: 0.5&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;Mb; chr 3: 7&#x02013;9&#x02009;Mb; chr 12: 20.5&#x02013;22.5&#x02009;Mb) and observed no significant difference between using unphased and phased reference panels when comparing accuracies between imputed HDRA individuals and their corresponding known genotypes from the 3KRG resequencing panel (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Though there was no loss in accuracy, imputation using unphased reference panels was orders of magnitude slower. We therefore opted to use phased reference panels for the remainder of our imputation testing.</p><p id="Par8">Imputation depends on there being&#x000a0;haplotype segments in the reference panel that are&#x000a0;similar to those found in the study panel. To explore parameter settings on imputation accuracy, we imputed chromosome 3 in 15 equally sized chunks. We used the full reference panel (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2973) and varied the parameter <italic>k</italic>, the number of conditioning states chosen for each study haplotype per Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) iteration, at values of 5, 50, 100, 200, and 400 and an effective population size (<italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>) of 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 (maximum allowed by IMPUTE2). Previous estimates of effective population size for domesticated rice and its wild relatives ranged from 12,000 to 46,000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous reporting that the IMPUTE2 algorithm was robust to changes in <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we observed no major effect of <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> on chromosome 3 imputation accuracy (site-based <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). There was a slight positive effect of increasing k (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b&#x02013;c</xref>). Median accuracies for all <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> by <italic>k</italic> combinations were 1.0, computed for polymorphic markers in the Gold Standard Panel. To assess the effect of reference panel size (<italic>R</italic>), we randomly subsampled the full reference panel (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2973) at four sizes (<italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50, 100, and 500) 50 times each and imputed a 2&#x02009;Mb test region on chromosome 3 (position 7&#x02013;9&#x02009;Mb), with fixed <italic>k</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 and <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,000. There was a positive effect of increased <italic>R</italic> on imputation accuracy, especially for markers with low minor allele frequency (MAF) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). We next imputed the full length of chromosomes 1 and 12 using the same gold standard study panel (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) to ensure that high accuracies at these selected parameter settings (<italic>k</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;100; <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,000; <italic>R</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;full) were not unique to chromosome 3. The resulting site <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> across chromosomes 1 and 12 was nearly 1.0 for polymorphic markers (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). High accuracies were maintained after removing potential close relatives of the Gold Standard Panel from the reference panel prior to imputation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Because the Gold Standard Panel was largely represented by <italic>tropical japonica</italic> and <italic>indica</italic>, we next checked whether subpopulation-specific limitations to imputation might exist. To do so, we generated subpopulation-specific study panels by randomly sampling (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50 per study panel) from the 3KRG and imputing them independently using separate reference panels composed of the 3KRG minus the individuals from the study panel of interest, leaving 2973 individuals in each reference panel. The study panels were TEJ, TRJ, ARO, AUS, IND1, IND2, and IND3, representing <italic>temperate japonica, tropical japonica, aromatic, aus</italic>, and three <italic>indica</italic> subgroups, respectively. Three study panels were used for the <italic>indica</italic> subpopulation because the large proportion of <italic>indicas</italic> found in 3KRG (59.7%) resulted in further stratification of the <italic>indica</italic> subpopulation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). Imputation accuracy across the MAF spectrum was generally high across all seven study panels (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>); however, IND1 was observed to have a lower accuracy than IND2 and IND3 at markers with MAF&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.20 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b&#x02013;d</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">To see whether markers of low imputation accuracy were dispersed or grouped, we examined the distribution of accuracy values across the physical distance of chromosome three for IND1, IND2, and IND3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). A half dozen clusters of markers with low accuracy were observed in IND1, with half as many observed in IND2 or IND3. Interestingly, two clusters toward the end of the chromosome appear to be shared, one cluster between IND1 and IND2, and a different cluster between IND1 and IND3. Geographical association of the three <italic>indica</italic> subgroups (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>) and the fact that IND2 and IND3 are more widely dispersed while IND1 is primarily found in North Asia could suggest that genetic architecture related to local adaptation may underlie different imputation performance. IND2 and IND3 accessions were additionally found outside of Asia, as far as South America and Africa. Further analyses would need to be done to document whether a higher frequency of de novo mutations or introgressions (e.g., perhaps from <italic>Japonica</italic> subpopulations) may have given rise to unexpected haplotypes in IND1 and whether these relate to different selection regimes, proximity to wild ancestors, or specific adaptation to northern versus southern climes in Asia.</p><p id="Par11">Using parameter values of <italic>k</italic> at 100 and <italic>N</italic><sub>e</sub> of 10,000, we next imputed the full HDRA Panel (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1568) filtered to 160&#x02009;K SNPs out to 4.8&#x02009;M SNPs using the full 3KRG as the reference panel (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Using the unimputed and imputed data sets, we compared association analysis results for amylose content, a critical eating and cooking quality trait in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Although addition of markers cannot overcome the resolution deficiencies caused by naturally high LD in rice populations, increasing marker density creates a greater opportunity to detect causal SNPs or functional polymorphisms responsible for phenotypic variation. This in turn boosts signal strength of the msSNPs at association peaks.</p><p id="Par22">Having genome-wide imputed SNP information across the HDRA Panel can facilitate population genetic analyses on genes or regions of interest identified by GWA studies, without the need for additional sample sequencing. Using the set of significant genic SNPs in <italic>Wx</italic> from the imputed data set, we generated gene haplotypes that resolved all four classic phenotypic groupings for amylose content in <italic>indica</italic> rice and performed an allele-specific Extended Haplotype Homozygosity analysis across a 200-kb region containing the <italic>Wx</italic> gene using the msSNP as the focal SNP (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c</xref>). Haplotypes that strongly associate with traits such as grain quality are critically valuable to rice breeders, who can use this information to make selections even if the FNP itself is unknown in their material. These types of population genetic analyses are not possible using the original, unimputed HDRA data set due to the ascertainment bias inherent in the array design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, e.g., selection for non-synonymous SNPs.</p><p id="Par23">One limitation to the data sets (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) developed in this study is that variants present depend on SNPs found in the 3KRG 4.8&#x02009;M data set, which had been originally filtered for 0.01 global minor allele frequency. This dependency can lead to the potential of missing rare variants in the final imputed data set. Rare SNPs, e.g., those private to a specific subpopulation at low frequency that were filtered out of&#x000a0;the 3KRG 4.8&#x02009;M SNP set would be absent. It would be of interest in the future to generate an updated RICE-RP derived from an unfiltered initial reference panel, or one that accounted for subpopulation-specific SNP frequency information. Such strategies would help retain rare variants in final imputed data sets.</p><p id="Par24">One interesting insight that emerged from investigating subpopulation-specific imputation accuracy is that imputation may offer a means to identify gaps in gene bank&#x000a0;collections with respect to geographic (and eco-climactic) variation and to rationally sample additional accessions&#x000a0;for further resequencing. In our study, we observed lower imputation accuracies in IND1, a subgroup of the <italic>indica</italic> subpopulation that is localized in China, suggesting that data gaps&#x000a0;exist for this subgroup. Passport information, which includes collection location (longitude and latitude), is available for&#x000a0;about 50% of gene bank samples and could be used to resolve&#x000a0;location data for those that only have country-level information&#x000a0;in a manner similar to that of Elhaik et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. With the imputed location data, the Focused Identification of Germplasm Samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> could be invoked with new samples chosen to fill gaps in sampling across eco-regional and climactic clines. If a locale already has several accessions that have been resequenced at high coverage, then new accessions from the same area or from a similar eco-climactic zone could be resequenced at lower depth. For accessions that fill prospective gaps in the collection, deeper resequencing would likely be beneficial, so that novel, rare alleles may be identified. These approaches can therefore assist gene banks in extending genotypic data to optimally cover the species diversity, allowing for heightened value and better use of resources.</p><p id="Par25">Having the ability to efficiently impute rice genetic data opens the door to a wide range of applications that extend beyond the few demonstrated in this study. Perhaps of the greatest immediate impact, it facilitates integration of data sets. Crop researchers commonly handle a range of germplasm types, resulting in genomic data sets of varying marker densities on independent collections of samples, each developed to address specific problems of interest. Imputation facilitates the integration of these resources by mapping them onto a common genomic framework without the added time and expense of re-genotyping. It also offers the option of waiting to make a final selection&#x000a0;of germplasm or SNPs until after integration, tailoring the best selection possible for the researcher&#x02019;s need. Imputation provides&#x000a0;the means to update previously genotyped panels quickly and at little cost, often dramatically increasing the resolution of existing resources. As GWA experiments in rice continue to accumulate in the literature, imputation can enable future GWA meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> on agronomically critical traits by allowing the combination of germplasm and phenotypes across published studies.</p><p id="Par26">Increasing access to imputation tools is one measure to encourage interoperability of crop genomic resources, promote re-use of publicly available and internally collected data, augment the impact of individual data sets, and inform future gene bank resequencing efforts. To facilitate imputation analysis for rice researchers, we developed a publicly available imputation web tool called Rice Imputation Server. This service harnesses the results of this study and leverages haplotype diversity found within the Rice Reference Panel. One critical feature that will likely contribute to long-term utility of this tool is its modularity; it is set up to readily accept upgrades to either the imputation software (e.g., a new version of IMPUTE2) or data (e.g., a higher density version of RICE-RP) as they develop. Future directions for improvements to the service may include offering region-specific imputation for researchers interested in data at certain loci of interest rather than genome-wide and incorporating indel or other non-SNP variant imputation capacities. To help users manage their resulting large data bundle, we offer &#x0201c;SNP filter&#x0201d; text files that can feed directly into Plink1.9 along with the user&#x02019;s imputed plink binary data set as a functional approach to filtering genome-wide SNPs. Making imputation capability more accessible to plant research communities may improve the power of phenotype&#x02013;genotype association studies, enhancing the productivity of basic investigations into molecular mechanisms and simultaneously accelerating translation into productive, stress-tolerant, and nutritional plant varieties that are urgently needed to enhance global food security.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Genotype information</title><p id="Par27">SNP information on 1568 individuals genotyped on the High-Density Rice Array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and 3024 individuals genotyped as part of the 3000 Rice Genomes Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> were previously published&#x000a0;and now have been assigned germplasm doi's for the first time (Supplementary Data 1).
