    "The origin of morphological novelties is an important but neglected issue of evolutionary biology. The fruit of the genus Physalis, a berry, is encapsulated by a novel morphological feature of the post-floral, accrescent calyx that is referred to as a Chinese lantern. The evolutionary developmental genetics of the Chinese lantern have been investigated in the last decade; however, the selective values of the morphological novelty remain elusive. Here, we measured the photosynthetic parameters of the fruiting calyces, monitored microclimatic variation within the Chinese lanterns during fruit development, performed floral-calyx-removal experiments, and recorded the fitness-related traits in Physalis floridana. Ultimately, we show that the green-fruiting calyx of Physalis has photosynthetic capabilities, thus serving as an energy source for fruit development. Moreover, the developing Chinese lantern provides a microclimate that benefits the development and maturation of berry and seed, and it improves plant fitness in terms of fruit/seed weight and number, and fruit maturation under low-temperature environments. Furthermore, the lantern structure facilitates the dispersal of fruits and seeds by water and wind. Our results suggest that the Chinese lantern morphology of Physalis is an evolutionary adaptive trait and improves plant fitness, thus providing new insight into the origin of morphological novelties."
