It can be applied either fresh or after burning to black carbon or ash. A central concern during rice cultivation is accumulation of carcinogenic arsenic and the question arises how much rice straw application contributes to nutrient versus arsenic supply in paddy fields. Laboratory incubation experiments were performed to assess the effect of rice straw, black carbon and ash on element mobilization. Our experiments showed initially higher silicon and phosphorus release from black carbon compared to fresh straw amendments. However, more re-sorption to soil lead to finally slightly lower pore water concentrations for black carbon versus fresh straw amendments. Highest arsenic, iron, manganese and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were observed after fresh rice straw application. Black carbon and ash application lead to only minor increases of arsenic compared to controls without amendments. Overall, for silicon and phosphorus the soil acts as sink while for iron and arsenic it was the main source. In summary, burning of rice straw to black carbon prior to application seems to yield a high increase in desired nutrient and a decrease in undesired arsenic mobilization in paddy soils.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is the major staple food worldwide. High yield production requires sufficient nutrient supply. Beside N for proteins, nucleic acids and chlorophyll, and P for forming important biomolecules (ATP, DNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, also silicon (Si) or trace elements such as iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) are important for good rice plant performance. As alternative to application of fertilizers during rice cultivation, rice straw may be used, because nutrients stored in the rice straw are then returned to the rice field soil after harvest. The most common way is to just leave the fresh rice straw in the field after harvesting and threshing for natural decomposition of the organic carbon and release of nutrients until the next crop cycle starts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Typically, non-decomposed rice straw is still in the field when the next generation of plants is seeded or planted either because there is a short succession of crop cycles or the climate is too cold for high microbial activity and complete decomposition. Non-decomposed rice straw is then in most cases ploughed in before starting the next crop cycle and decomposition continues.</p><p id="Par3">Some farmers also burn the rice straw to accelerate nutrient release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Depending on burning temperature and completeness of mineralization, black carbon (~350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C burning temperature), biochar (400 to 700&#x02009;&#x000b0;C fixed-bed slow pyrolysis) or ash (full oxidation) forms. Numerous studies have shown the release of individual nutrients from either fresh straw (P, Si, sulfide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>), black carbon (Si, P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), biochar (Si<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>), ash (Si, P), or a mixture of ash and charred material (Si, P, Fe, and As<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). Rice straw is more prone to microbial decomposition compared to black carbon or ash, and hence induces a lower redox potential in the paddy soil pore water which promotes mobilization of Fe and P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Where rice straw is burned by farmers after harvest directly on the soils by open field burning, fire conditions of common soil fires can be assumed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The temperature of such fires is in the range of ~350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, but the maximum observed temperatures are up to 630&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Such burning is fast and the availability of oxygen is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, in most cases excluding the formation of biochar. During burning of straw to black carbon or ash, iron-oxides can be formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> with subsequent sorption of elements like P. Rice does not only accumulate nutrients, but also toxicants. The most well-known toxicant in rice is arsenic (As), which is carcinogenic to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Arsenic occurs ubiquitously in nature and is highly mobile under anoxic conditions, such as they exist in paddy soils. Three main species dominate in paddy soils: Arsenate under (micro)oxic conditions e.g. at the plant roots due to root radial oxygen loss, arsenite under anoxic conditions in the soil, and dimethylarsenate produced by methylating soil microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. All these As species can enter the rice plant due to their similarity to nutrients: Arsenite and dimethylarsenate enter the cell roots via aquaporin channels, which are also responsible for uptake of silicic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and arsenate is taken up via phosphate transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Arsenic levels in rice are therefore intrinsically linked to availability of nutrients. Under Si- and P-deficient conditions, As uptake increases. Oxidation of Fe(II) in soil solution to Fe(III) and its precipitation in the microoxic root rhizosphere with formation of Fe plaque decreases As uptake due to sorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Sulfur has also been reported to decrease As uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, though the exact mechanisms are not clearly understood. Hence, the concentration of those elements in soil pore waters affects As accumulation in rice plant tissues.</p><p id="Par4">Accumulation of As in rice plants is not only a problem with respect to immediate grain consumption, but also for the practice to keep rice straw on the fields to retain the nutrients (and with them the toxicants). Concentrations of As in rice straw reach up to 100&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> DW<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Concentrations in roots are comparably high, but quantitatively straw is more important for element cycling because of the significantly higher biomass. Currently available data show a significant As release from paddy soils after biochar application and as a result higher As accumulation in rice plants growing in those soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. It was shown that microbes are able to use biochar for respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, which leads to enhanced mobilization of As due to dissolution of Fe minerals. However, typically, biochar is not produced by open field burnings practiced by farmers (see above), instead black carbon and ash are produced in different amounts depending on burning conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, despite knowledge about the effect of straw application and application of straw burned to a mixture of ash and charred material on element availabilities in paddy soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, little is known about the different effects of black carbon and ash.</p><p id="Par5">In our study, we investigated the release of the nutrients Si, P, Fe, S versus the toxicant As and other trace elements (Mn, Cu, Zn) under oxic versus anoxic conditions to simulate decomposition of straw. Furthermore, we tested the effect of straw decomposition on top of the soil versus straw ploughed into the soil. Our hypothesis was that application of fresh straw leads to a high mobilization of redox sensitive elements (P, Fe, As) and other elements accumulated in straw (e.g. Si). We expected less mobilization from black carbon or ash due to lower microbial activity (less labile carbon) leading to higher redox potential and formation of iron oxides as binding sites for e.g. P and As during burning. We compared nutrient versus arsenic release from different forms of rice straw (fresh straw, black carbon, ash) over time in incubations with and without paddy soil. Original release from straw was distinguished from secondary immobilization to soil and the major source (soil or straw) for each element was identified. In the end, we discuss in which form (fresh, black carbon, ash) rice straw is used best to maximize nutrient and minimize arsenic release.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects on pH, redox potential, conductivity, DOC and element concentrations from incubation experiments with fresh straw under oxic and anoxic conditions in the absence of soil</title><p id="Par6">Decomposition of fresh rice straw proceeded significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <italic>t</italic>-test) faster under oxic compared to anoxic conditions.

Rice straw not ploughed into the soil will be decomposed under aquatic conditions (within the overlying water body) once the field is flooded for the next generation of rice plant cultivation. Our experiments showed that when rice straw is decomposed within the overlying water body under oxic conditions, decomposition proceeded much faster compared to anoxic conditions probably due to differences in microbial community and activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and much higher amounts of Si and P were mobilized under oxic conditions. The mobilization of Si from organic material during decomposition is generally slow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and some Si fractions are still not dissolved after months, as shown before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. For P, maximum concentrations observed under oxic conditions in solution (3.2&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were already close to complete mobilization from the straw we used (considering a total P concentration in the straw of ~116&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;P g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Supplementary Material Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref>) and the usage of 30&#x02009;g straw per 800&#x02009;mL experiment volume, maximum expectable P concentrations would be 4.3&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Mobilization of the toxicant As was low under oxic conditions and most of the released As was re-bound to the remaining straw material, reducing the aqueous concentrations over time again (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Mobilization of As was comparably low under anoxic like under oxic conditions despite a known higher As mobility at low redox potentials. Considering a total As concentration in the straw of 1.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.34&#x02009;&#x000b5;g As g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (Supplementary Material Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A</xref>), maximum expectable total As concentrations would be 41&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> As. Hence, the maximum concentrations observed (~38&#x02009;&#x000b5;g&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> As) were already close to complete mobilization from the straw even under oxic conditions. Overall low mobilisation of Fe (0.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared to a maximum expectable concentration of ~14&#x02009;mg&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as well as decreasing As and P concentrations towards the end of our experiments may be potentially explained by binding to growing heterotrophic biofilm on the straw material, as previously shown for other organic material under decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">If rice straw material was burned to either black carbon or ash prior to application, mobilization of Si into paddy field surface water was much higher. These results confirm previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The lower availability of P from ash can potentially be explained by the high Ca content of rice straw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> leading to calcium phosphate formation during burning to ash strongly increasing the pH of the material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The lower mobilization of As and Fe from the burning products (black carbon and ash) may be explained by formation of iron-oxides during burning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> with subsequent sorption of As.</p><p id="Par14">Typically, however, in paddy soils fresh rice straw will not just remain on top of the field but be ploughed in and decompose in interaction with surrounding soil. Straw is clearly the source for Si and P (see results above and literature, e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>). However, the significantly lower pore water Si and P concentrations in experiments with soil compared to those without soils suggest that part of the released Si and P was adsorbed to the soil. Hence, paddy soils act as sink for pore water Si and P at each time point, representing snapshots of the adsorption-desorption equilibrium between soil solid and aqueous phase. The same effect was found for black carbon and ash application. For black carbon and ash, the immobilization of Si and P, by potential binding to soil minerals, was slightly higher compared to the straw treatment. In case of P, this higher immobilization in the black carbon and ash treatment may be attributed to the higher redox potential during incubation experiments probably due to changes in microbial community or lower microbial activity as a result of lower availability of labile carbon after burning and the potential higher amount of iron minerals formed during burning (see above). Compared to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, showing a negative effect of rice straw burning (leading to a mixture of ash and charred material) on P mobilization (after application in paddy soils), the data of the present study clearly shows that burning to black carbon leads to a much higher P mobilization compared to ash, which our data suggest for the first time when using rice straw as source material. Hence, burning conditions have a very strong influence on later nutrient availability, when using straw-based amendments, which our data suggest for the first time when using rice straw as source material. The strongly increased Fe mobilization in treatments with straw application can be explained by the lower redox potential mobilizing Fe from soil minerals. Under these conditions, also a strong increase of the toxicant As occurred, with As-speciation changing from dominantly arsenate to the even more toxic arsenite (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Microbial biofilm colonizing decomposing rice straw material generally has a high affinity for element binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Seemingly, however, As released from the soil due to lower redox potential as a result of straw decomposition is not re-adsorbed. Hence, application of rice straw leads to slightly enhanced nutrient (Si and P) availability but also to a strongly enhanced toxicant (As) availability.</p><p id="Par15">High Si and P concentrations might have a further enhancing effect on As mobilization, because both compete with As for soil sorption sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The same elements will compete again for uptake by rice roots. The Si mobilization from especially straw and black carbon may help to reduce a possible Si deficiency at the end of the rice growing season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In the presence of high Si availability derived from rice straw, black carbon or ash application, a decrease of As uptake may occur to a certain extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The same holds true for high P mobilization from the amendments potentially reducing the uptake of arsenate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. But there might be also an interdependency between Si and P, with Si strongly competing with P for soil binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> controlling P availability for plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">In summary, our findings further emphasize difficulties with regard to use of rice residuals as fertilizers. Rice straw residuals are inevitably produced during rice cultivation. If they are not used on-site they have to be removed and additional synthesized fertilizer has to be applied. On the other hand, they are a naturally available and cheap source of fertilizer for rice farmers and in many countries they are still routinely burned to accelerate decomposition and nutrient availability for the next generation of plants. From a fertilization point of view, burning rice residuals to black carbon is the best option because it maximizes nutrient availability, while at the same timekeeping As mobilization low. Our results also suggest that, when burning, controlling fire conditions is crucial, because burning rice straw to ash, instead of black carbon, will result in much lower nutrient availability. Natural degradation of fresh straw on the other hand can only be recommended if As concentrations in the rice straw are really low. However, burning rice straw inevitably results in other environmental problems e.g. peaks in greenhouse gas emissions and increased atmospheric particle load. Sustainable future solutions will therefore need to balance both from an economical and from an environmental point of view costs and benefits of fresh rice straw use on-site (no transport costs and no peak atmospheric contamination, but highest arsenic mobility), burning on-site (no transport costs, highest nutrient availability, but peak atmospheric contamination), and removal with or without re-use after off-site treatment (e.g. controlled burning with no or little atmospheric contamination, but significant transport costs or costs for rice straw disposal).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experimental setup</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experiments without soil</title><p id="Par17">To separate mobilization from straw and immobilization to soil, we conducted incubation experiments without soil.
