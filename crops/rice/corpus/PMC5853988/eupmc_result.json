    "Continuation of healthy nutritional behaviors is one of the important factors in effectiveness of educational intervention programs. The aim of this research is to compare the Health Belief Model and the Ecological-social model in reducing consumption of rice contaminated with toxic metals after completion of environmental intervention and continuation of consumption of healthy rice.This research was the implementation of a six-month randomized controlled trial interventional program in two groups' interventions along with a control group, with 80 people for each group totally, amounting to 240 women, between 18 and 50 years of age in Ilam, Iran in 2014. The questionnaires of the three groups consisted of demographic information, knowledge, the constructs of the models, performance of rice consumption. Friedman test and repeated measures used for data analysis with SPSS (version 20), and confidence interval of 95% were considered.The results of the Friedman test indicated a significant increase in the number of women consuming healthy rice over six months after intervention in both intervention groups (p<0.001). Women in the ECO group consumed healthy rice 27.5% more than the HBM group (p<0.001). The results of repeated measures analysis of variance suggested greater improvement in the consumption of healthy rice in the ECO group in comparison with the HBM group over six months after intervention (p<0.05).Both educational environmental intervention methods caused the altered diet of people regarding consumption of healthy rice over six months after the intervention. Increased social support also probably had a more effective role in continuation of healthy diet among the people."
