    "BACKGROUND:Plant glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzes the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to produce glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P), and plays a key role in glycerolipid metabolism as well as stress responses. RESULTS:In this study, we report the cloning, enzymatic and physiological characterization of a cytosolic NAD+-dependent GPDH from maize. The prokaryotic expression of ZmGPDH1 in E.coli showed that the enzyme encoded by ZmGPDH1 was capable of catalyzing the reduction of DHAP in the presence of NADH. The functional complementation analysis revealed that ZmGPDH1 was able to restore the production of glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerol in AtGPDHc-deficient mutants. Furthermore, overexpression of ZmGPDH1 remarkably enhanced the tolerance of Arabidopsis to salinity/osmotic stress by enhancing the glycerol production, the antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, CAT, APX) and by maintaining the cellular redox homeostasis (NADH/NAD+, ASA/DHA, GSH/GSSG). ZmGPDH1 OE Arabidopsis plants also exhibited reduced leaf water loss and stomatal aperture under salt and osmotic stresses. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that overexpression of ZmGPDH1 promoted the transcripts accumulation of genes involved in cellular redox homeostasis and ROS-scavenging system. CONCLUSIONS:Together, these data suggested that ZmGPDH1 is involved in conferring salinity and osmotic tolerance in Arabidopsis through modulation of glycerol synthesis, stomatal closure, cellular redox and ROS homeostasis."
