    "Dormancy is the mechanism that allows seeds to become temporally quiescent in order to select the right time and place to germinate. Like in other species, in barley, grain dormancy is gradually reduced during after-ripening. Phosphosignaling networks in barley grains were investigated by a large-scale analysis of phosphoproteins to examine potential changes in response pathways to after-ripening. We used freshly harvested (FH) and after-ripened (AR) barley grains which showed different dormancy levels. The LC-MS/MS analysis identified 2346 phosphopeptides in barley embryos, with 269 and 97 of them being up- or downregulated during imbibition, respectively. A number of phosphopeptides were differentially regulated between FH and AR samples, suggesting that phosphoproteomic profiles were quite different between FH and AR grains. Motif analysis suggested multiple protein kinases including SnRK2 and MAPK could be involved in such a difference between FH and AR samples. Taken together, our results revealed phosphosignaling pathways in barley grains during the water imbibition process."
