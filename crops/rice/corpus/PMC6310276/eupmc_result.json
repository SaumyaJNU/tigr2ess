    "The plant NAC transcription factors depict one of the largest plant transcription factor families. They regulate a wide range of different developmental processes and most probably played an important role in the evolutionary diversification of plants. This makes comparative studies of the NAC transcription factor family between individual species and genera highly relevant and such studies have in recent years been greatly facilitated by the increasing number of fully sequenced complex plant genomes. This study combines the characterization of the NAC transcription factors in the recently sequenced genome of the cereal crop barley with expression analysis and a comprehensive phylogenetic characterization of the NAC transcription factors in other monocotyledonous plant species. Our results provide evidence for the emergence of a NAC transcription factor subclade that is exclusively expressed in the grains of the Poaceae family of grasses. These notably comprise a number of cereal crops other than barley, such as wheat, rice, maize or millet, which are all cultivated for their starchy edible grains. Apparently, the grain specific subclade emerged from a well described subgroup of NAC transcription factors associated with the senescence process. A promoter exchange subsequently resulted in grain specific expression. We propose to designate this transcription factor subclade Grain-NACs and we discuss their involvement in programmed cell death as well as their potential role in the evolution of the Poaceae grain, which doubtlessly is of central importance for human nutrition."
