Here we show via time-course analyses of SL binding and hydrolysis by <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> D14, that the level of uncleaved SL strongly correlates with the induction of the active signaling state. In addition, we show that an AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> catalytic mutant that lacks enzymatic activity is still able to complement the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant phenotype in an SL-dependent manner. We conclude that the intact SL molecules trigger the D14 active signaling state, and we also describe that D14 deactivates bioactive SLs by the hydrolytic degradation after signal transmission. Together, these results reveal that D14 is a dual-functional receptor, responsible for both the perception and deactivation of bioactive SLs.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Cleavage of strigolactone by the D14 receptor was assumed to produce an active intermediate that promotes signaling.

In this paper, the rice D14 is referred to as <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> D14 (OsD14) to distinguish from AtD14. The D14 enzymes belong to the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-fold hydrolase family and possess the canonical catalytic triad: Ser, His, and Asp. In fact, D14 acts as a hydrolase for some SLs, cleaving them into ABC-ring (ABC-formyltricyclic lactone; ABC-FTL), and D-ring (Hydroxymethylbutenolide; HMB) parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In rice, signal transduction occurs through an SL-dependent interaction between OsD14 and a negative regulator of SL signaling, D53 (SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE (SMXL) 6/7/8 in Arabidopsis), leading to the rapid degradation of D53 through the 26&#x02009;S proteasome pathway in a manner that requires the F-box protein, D3 (MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) in Arabidopsis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The receptor function of D14 in the SL pathway has been established; however, the role of SL hydrolysis in the signaling mechanism has been a subject of debate. A significant question is when and how the signal is transduced while D14 interacts with SLs: is the signal transduced before, during, or after the hydrolysis of SLs by D14?</p><p id="Par5">Recently, two groups proposed a model in which the hormone signaling is mediated by a covalently linked reaction intermediate of SL with D14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A covalent modification involving His of D14 catalytic triad with the D-ring part of SL derived molecule was detected by mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, Yao et al. solved a crystal structure of an AtD14-D3-ASK1 multiprotein signaling complex induced by an SL analog, GR24 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The authors proposed that in this signaling complex AtD14 possesses a D-ring derived molecule, which was covalently linked with AtD14 bridging the Ser with the His of the catalytic triad. The authors named this sealed molecule to be covalently linked intermediate molecule (CLIM). Moreover, significant conformational changes were observed for AtD14 in the multiprotein complex when compared with its apo structure. Based on these results, a model has been proposed in which the CLIM is necessary for the induction of conformational changes in the AtD14 protein and the SL signal is transduced during its hydrolysis. However, very recently Carlsson et al. reanalyzed this complex structure data and found that the electron density in the active site is too small to accommodate the proposed CLIM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. More likely, the substance bound to the active site is not the CLIM, rather an iodine ion from the crystallization reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition to the uncertain structure data, the hydrolysis reaction by D14 was reported to be extremely slow, on the order of hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, whereas degradation of the target protein, D53/SMXLs, was detected within 5&#x02013;20&#x02009;min after the SL treatment in planta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, the CLIM model, which requires the hydrolysis reaction of D14 to transmit the signal, is inconsistent with this rapid response. Taken together, although the structural characterization of the D3-bound form of AtD14 was a significant breakthrough in this research field, the signaling mechanism, in particular the chemical signal that induces the active signaling state of D14, remains a matter of debate.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we report that the active signaling state of D14 can be triggered upon intact SL binding, but not by the hydrolysis intermediate. We also demonstrate that D14 can deactivate SLs by hydrolytic degradation after signal transmission.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><bold>S</bold>tructural requirements for the D14-SL interaction</title><p id="Par7">In order to understand the relationship between the hydrolysis reaction and the signal transducing role of D14, we first comprehensively examined the structural requirements for the D14-SL interaction using various naturally occurring SLs and synthetic analogs by hydrolysis assays and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) experiments, which can evaluate protein-chemicals interactions by monitoring protein melting temperature (Tm) shifts induced upon exposure to chemicals. The hydrolysis kinetics of the AtD14-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction were measured using the naturally occurring single isomer of 5-deoxystrigol (5DS) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). We detected two previously reported hydrolysis products, ABC-FTL and HMB, generated in a catalytic triad Ser-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>, and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> were calculated to be 4.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, 4.0&#x02009;nmol/min/mg protein, and 0.12&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). Among the stereoisomers of SLs, (2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic>)-isomers have a demonstrably greater effect on the inhibition of shoot branching than the (2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>)-isomers in both Arabidopsis and rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). We observed that AtD14 hydrolyzes the (2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic>)-isomers more efficiently than the (2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>)-isomers across all tested SLs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). OsD14 also preferred (2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic>)-isomers of 5DS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). A biologically inactive analog, in which the double bond of the enol ether bridge is replaced by a single bond, 3,6&#x02032;-dihydroGR24<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, was not hydrolyzed by AtD14/OsD14 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Debranones, such as Br-PMF and CN-PMF, are a class of non-enol ether-type SL analogs (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>). They were reported to inhibit shoot branching in an AtD14/OsD14- and MAX2/D3- dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We quantitatively examined the hydrolyzability of Br-PMF and CN-PMF by AtD14, which demonstrated that both of them are significantly poorer substrates when compared with GR24 (racemic mixture, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>).

An AB-ring truncated analog, GR5 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>), was reported to inhibit shoot branching, and the (2&#x02032;<italic>R</italic>)-isomer, (+)-GR5, showed much stronger activity than the (2&#x02032;<italic>S</italic>)-isomer in shoot branching inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Here we found that only (+)-GR5, but not (&#x02212;)-GR5, induces a clear melting temperature shift similar to 5DS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). By comparison, the biologically inactive analogs, such as ABC-FTL, HMB, and 3,6&#x02032;-dihydroGR24, were insufficient to induce the same Tm shifts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Debranones were also reported to induce a Tm shift for OsD14/DAD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and here we show that CN-PMF clearly induces a Tm shift for AtD14/OsD14 similar to 5DS, despite the fact that CN-PMF is less hydrolyzable (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). Taken together with the hydrolysis assays, these data conclusively demonstrate that the Tm shift of D14 directly correlates with biological activity of the SL-related compounds, suggesting that the temperature shifts reflects the induction of an active signaling state of D14, possibly related to the conformational changes seen in the AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex structure. In addition, a previous report demonstrated that the biologically active SL-related compounds could specifically promote OsD14-D3 interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Given that the bioactive SL-dependent Tm shift observed in our DSF experiments, thermal destabilization of OsD14 is likely correlated with D3 binding.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Evaluation of the AtD14-SL interaction using hydrolysis and DSF assays. <bold>a</bold> Melting temperature curves of AtD14 in the presence of various SLs and analogs.

RMS3 was proposed to be a single turnover enzyme with a pro-fluorescent analog, GC242<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The authors suggested the hydrolyzed D-ring was trapped through a covalent bond with the catalytic triad His, and this might be the reason for the single turnover reaction. However, we observed that all of the GR24 was consumed when the reaction was performed at a 1:6 molar ratio of AtD14:GR24 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This clearly demonstrates that AtD14 is not a single turnover enzyme with GR24. Interestingly, we further observed that ABC-FTL and HMB were released at almost same rate that GR24 was consumed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Generally, the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by this protein family is a two-step process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. First, the activated hydroxyl group of the catalytic triad Ser acts as a nucleophile attacking to possibly the D-ring part of SLs to release the first product, ABC-FTL. At the same time, the protein forms a covalently-linked reaction intermediate with the D-ring part through the Ser residue of D14. Then, if we apply a conventional reaction model of this protein family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, the activated water molecule triggers the second attack to the D14/D-ring complex to cleave the covalent bond, and HMB is released as the second product. On the other hand, according to two recent reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the D-ring part is likely transferred to the catalytic triad His residue before its release as HMB, which was speculated to be significantly slower. However, our observation makes it unlikely that the D-ring derived product gets covalently trapped within the protein for a significant amount of time because the HMB release was detected at almost same turnover as the ABC-FTL release, and suggests that the second attack from a water molecule must occur immediately after the first attack from the catalytic Ser. Even if the covalently linked modification of His takes place, it must be released quickly as a product. Thus, it is likely that the first attack is rate limiting, which may cause slow catalysis.</p><p id="Par10">We then performed the DSF experiments simultaneously with hydrolysis monitoring in order to observe the correlation between the degree of hydrolysis and the Tm shift. Strikingly, the maximum Tm shift was detected upon initial incubation with SL (0&#x02009;min), before gradually returning to the control Tm over the course of the hydrolysis reaction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), such that the GR24 consumption curve was highly correlated with the degree of the Tm shift (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a, b</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the signal that induces the Tm shift of AtD14 is GR24, is not the hydrolysis intermediate or products, suggesting that the active state of AtD14 is triggered upon GR24 binding, prior to its hydrolysis.</p><p id="Par11">When GR24 was used as a substrate, we found that the background hydrolysis reaction was ongoing during DSF detection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). To observe the correlation between the hydrolysis reaction and the temperature shift more precisely, we used a less-hydrolyzable analog, CN-PMF. As expected, CN-PMF was much more stable than GR24 during DSF detection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref>). Although, the effect of CN-PMF on the Tm shift of AtD14 was smaller when compared with GR24, the slight shift persisted for a longer time because the rate of CN-PMF hydrolysis was much slower than GR24 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3e, f</xref>). To monitor the Tm shift more closely, the concentration of CN-PMF was increased and we were able to observe a clear correlation between substrate consumption and the Tm shift that is similar to GR24 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3g-i</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that the uncleaved substrate itself, not the hydrolysis intermediate or the products, induces the Tm shift of AtD14. In contrast to reports regarding the role of CLIM in inducing conformational changes of AtD14, our results strongly suggest that the active state of AtD14 is triggered by the intact SL molecule prior to its hydrolytic degradation. Given that the two products were released at almost the same turnover rate, the lifetime of the covalently attached intermediate must be exceedingly short. It is unlikely that such a short-lived intermediate induces the drastic conformational changes necessary to recruit other partner proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">To address this question more directly, we analyzed the D-ring modification of AtD14 using LC-MS/MS during hydrolysis. Consistent with the reported data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we also detected a peak whose molecular mass increased by 98&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5, suggesting that AtD14 forms a covalently attached intermediate with the D-ring part of SL during the hydrolysis reaction (Supplementary Fig.<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). This conjugate peak was detected in both the native and denatured samples (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). We performed a time-course analysis of this modified AtD14, and found that the intensity of the conjugate peak initially increased from 0 to 15&#x02009;min, then gradually decreased over-time until 4&#x02009;h when most of the AtD14 protein existed as unbound form. These results suggest that the D-ring part, which is once bound to AtD14, is released rapidly without being trapped tightly (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the level of the covalently-linked AtD14 does not correlate with the degree of the Tm shift of AtD14, suggesting that the reaction intermediate is not a chemical that induces the transition of the AtD14 state. Because a small peak for modified AtD14 was still detectable after 4&#x02009;h when all the substrate, GR24, was consumed, we individually incubated AtD14 with a reaction product, HMB. We found that even HMB alone could induce the formation of modified AtD14 at 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>). Although at a lower concentration (40&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), the modified AtD14 peak was almost undetectable, HMB produced in the ligand binding pocket by the hydrolysis reaction possibly forms the conjugate more effectively than the exogenously applied HMB, because HMB was reported to be trapped in the pocket after its release as a product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus it would be difficult to distinguish whether this modified protein is a hydrolysis intermediate or a conjugate formed with HMB after the completion of hydrolysis. We analyzed the covalently modified AtD14 formation using CN-PMF as a substrate, and found a tendency similar to the case with GR24 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4d</xref> and e). Notably, a gradual increment of the modified AtD14 peak was more clearly observed in the case of CN-PMF than GR24, which does not correlate with the melting temperature shift. These results again support the idea that the substrate, but not the reaction intermediate, induced the melting temperature shift.</p><p id="Par13">Our time-course DSF experiments demonstrate that the Tm of AtD14 is initially lowered by SL binding before it returns to the unbound state temperature. This result indicates that the SL-inducible dynamics of AtD14 is reversible. To further examine this, we spiked in fresh GR24 to the 4&#x02009;h pre-incubated sample in which all the initially added substrate was consumed. As a result, the enzyme was still capable of hydrolyzing freshly added GR24, and fresh GR24 could induce the melting temperature shift of pre-incubated AtD14. These results again demonstrate that AtD14 is not a single turn over enzyme with GR24, and that the SL-inducible transition of AtD14 state is reversible depending on the presence of intact SL (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Moreover, our results clearly reveal that debranones, which are much less hydrolyzable than GR24, cause the Tm shift to last for a longer time, thus providing an explanation for the potent biological activities of these analogs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Functional analysis of D14 catalytic triad mutants</title><p id="Par14">To evaluate the necessity of the hydrolytic function of D14, we next prepared four catalytic triad mutants (AtD14<sup>S97A</sup>, AtD14<sup>S97C</sup>, AtD14<sup>D218A</sup>, and AtD14<sup>H247A</sup>) and found that the hydrolase activities of all of these mutants are drastically reduced when compared with a negative control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Although the RMS3<sup>S96C</sup> mutant was reported to have slight hydrolysis activity for GC242<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the hydrolysis activity for 5DS in the corresponding mutant in Arabidopsis, AtD14<sup>S97C</sup>, was reduced to the same level as other catalytic triad mutants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For each mutant we also observed that all of the substrate stayed intact after the incubation with enzyme, suggesting that the hydrolase reaction gets stuck before the initial nucleophilic attack step (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). To investigate the signal transducing function of these mutants, complementation tests were performed by expressing each mutant in the Arabidopsis <italic>atd14-2</italic> mutant background under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35&#x02009;S promoter. The expression of AtD14<sup>S97A</sup> and AtD14<sup>H247A</sup> did not complement the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant, which corroborates previous reports (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Very interestingly, we found that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup>, which has not previously been tested, completely complemented the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). In a previous report, AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> was unable to complement the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant when it was expressed as 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;HA tag fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; however, we observed that the expression of untagged AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> partially complemented the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant phenotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). In addition, we found that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> interacted with SMXL7 in an SL-dependent manner in yeast two hybrid (Y2H) experiments, suggesting that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> is still capable of signal transduction despite lacking hydrolase activity, while AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> weakly interacts with SMXL7 in the presence of MeCLA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). We also found that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> interacted with another signaling partner, MAX2, as examined by Y3H experiments, in which an SCF complex component, ASK1, was co-expressed without any tag as a third protein (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6d</xref>). Interestingly, the SL-dependent interaction between AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> and MAX2 was observed only in the presence of ASK1, possibly because ASK1 stabilizes MAX2. The DSF experiments using the catalytic triad mutant proteins revealed that 5DS lowered Tms for AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> and AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> slightly, but did not change the Tms for AtD14<sup>S97A</sup> or AtD14<sup>H247A</sup>, consistent with the observation that AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> and AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> retain the capacity for SL signaling <italic>in planta</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). According to the D14 apo structures, the catalytic triad Ser and His are present at the surface of the active site pocket, whereas the Asp residue does not form part of the pocket surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>), suggesting that these two residues might be important not only for the catalytic triad formation but also for the direct interaction with the ligand/substrate molecules. Therefore, the mutation to Ser and His possibly affected the initial interaction with SLs. Consistent with this idea, we found that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> and AtD14<sup>S97C</sup> mutant proteins, which were capable of signal transduction, exhibit higher binding activity with 5DS than other two mutants, AtD14<sup>S97A</sup> and AtD14<sup>H247A</sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). Because the Tm curve of AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> suggested that this protein was unstable, even in the absence of 5DS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>), we generated transgenic plants expressing AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> in the <italic>max4 atd14</italic> double knockout mutant background (<italic>max4</italic>; <italic>CCD8</italic> knockout defective for SL biosynthesis) to examine the SL dependency of this mutant protein function. These transgenic lines exhibited the severe branching phenotype, which was rescued by GR24 treatment, demonstrating that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> complements the <italic>atd14</italic> mutant in an SL-dependent manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). Furthermore, in this background we observed that AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> expressing plants were more sensitive to GR24 than the AtD14<sup>WT</sup> expressing plants, possibly because of the defect in the hydrolytic degradation of GR24 by AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), implying that the hydrolytic degradation of SL by D14 would be a deactivating step of bioactive SL. We also examined the function of the corresponding mutant in rice, OsD14<sup>D268A</sup>, and found that it also complemented the <italic>d14</italic> mutant phenotype despite lacking hydrolase activity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b-e</xref>). These results, together with the time-course DSF experiments, strongly suggest that the hydrolase reaction catalyzed by D14 is not necessary for the signal transducing role.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>In vitro and in vivo functional analysis of catalytic triad mutants of AtD14. <bold>a</bold> Hydrolysis activities of catalytic triad mutants of AtD14 using 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of 5DS as a substrate.

In addition, the geometry of the catalytic triad is disrupted in this structure due to the reordering of the loop containing the catalytic Asp (D218) residue (Asp loop)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The observed changes were reported to cause a significant reduction in the size of the active site pocket due to closure of the V-shaped lid (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>), and thus the authors suggested that the structural changes were triggered by a small molecule such as CLIM. On the other hand, our aforementioned data strongly suggest that the D14 active state is triggered by intact SL molecules. We downloaded the structural data of AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex (PDB code; 5HZG), and reanalyzed the structural changes in AtD14. Intriguingly, we found that the conformational change of the D218-containing loop enlarges the cavity adjacent to the catalytic Ser.

Thus this mutation significantly influenced the signal transducing role of D14 without affecting its hydrolase ability, suggesting that these mutant proteins would be a good tool to further investigate the physiological role of SL hydrolysis by D14. As mentioned above, the results with AtD14<sup>D218A</sup> mutant implied that the hydrolysis function of D14 is a deactivating step of bioactive hormone compounds because the transgenic plants expressing this enzymatically inactive mutant in the <italic>atd14 max4</italic> double mutant was highly sensitive to exogenously applied SL. If we hypothesize correctly, overexpression of the osd14-2 type mutant protein, which has only the hydrolase function, should cause the SL-deficient phenotype due to the reduction in bioactive hormone levels as were the cases with other plant hormones deactivating enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

When a bioactive SL binds the active site pocket of D14, it induces conformational changes to D14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Considering the presence of the enlarged pocket observed in the AtD14-D3 protein complex, it seems likely that SL initially induces a conformational change of the loop containing the catalytic triad Asp. After the formation of the enlarged pocket, SL may translocate within this pocket, triggering the open-to-close transition of the helical lid domain. Although there has been no evidence of such detailed events, our time-course DSF experiments together with the catalytic triad mutant analysis demonstrate that the induction of the D14 active state is triggered by an intact SL molecule, not by the hydrolysis intermediate or products. This means that the signaling process does not require the hydrolytic function of D14. In the AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex structure, an intact SL molecule was not observed in this newly formed pocket. It is likely that SL in the AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex crystal was partly hydrolyzed during crystallographic experiments due to a relatively high pH condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, resulting in poor electron density for the ligand molecules. Or it is also possible that the disordering of the Asp loop induced the detachment of the SL molecule during crystallization or other experimental procedure.</p><p id="Par19">Upon binding of the intact SL, D14 initially adopts a destabilized conformation characteristic of a catalytically inactive state that is due to the disruption of the catalytic triad formation. In this state, the conformationally altered D14 protein interacts with its signaling partners, D53/SMXLs and D3/MAX2, to transmit the SL signal. As seen in the AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex structure, D3/MAX2 F-box interacts with the activated D14 protein at the surface of the rearranged helical lid domain. In this complex, D53/SMXLs may bind around the Asp loop region. In our model, after degradation of the negative regulator of SL signaling, the loop returns to reconstruct the catalytic triad, which then induces the hydrolytic degradation and deactivation of bioactive SLs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The slow rate of the first attack from the Ser residue, as suggested by our hydrolysis monitoring, can be explained by this temporary physical disruption of the catalytic triad. The activation of hormone degradation pathways in signaling is exemplified in other plant hormone pathways, such as GA, and is considered to be an important mechanism to maintain homeostatic levels of active hormones in planta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

For the detection of AtD14 protein, the blots were treated with 5% skim milk in TBST (0.1% Tween20 in 2&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, and 13.7&#x02009;mM NaCl) for 2&#x02009;h and subsequently incubated with anti AtD14 antibody at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight. AtD14 antibody was produced in rabbit by BioGate Co using recombinant AtD14 protein (GST fusion) as the antigen. The quality of the antibody was evaluated using recombinant AtD14 and KAI2 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). After washing three times with TBST (10&#x02009;min each), the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, A4914, 100 times dilution) at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h.

Interactions between the two proteins were examined on selective media (SD-Trp/-Leu/-His or SD-Trp/-Leu/-Ura/-His) containing a 1:1000 dilution of the tested SL from an acetone-dissolved stock solution (0.1% acetone was used as a control). The plates were kept for 5 days at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. For western blotting analysis, each transformant was pre-incubated in SD-Trp/-Leu overnight at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, transferred to fresh YPDA medium, and incubated until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.5&#x02013;0.6.
