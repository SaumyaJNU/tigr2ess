    "Porous TiO₂ nanofibers (PTFs) and dense TiO₂ nanofibers (DTFs) were prepared using simple electrospinning for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). TiO₂ nanoparticles (TNPs) were prepared using a hydrothermal reaction. The as-prepared PTFs and DTFs (with a fiber diameter of around 200 nm) were mixed with TNPs such as TNP-PTF and TNP-DTF nanocomposites used in photoelectrode materials or were coated as light scattering layers on the photoelectrodes to improve the charge transfer ability and light harvesting effect of the DSSCs. The as-prepared TNPs showed a pure anatase phase, while the PTFs and DTFs showed both the anatase and rutile phases. The TNP-PTF composite (TNP:PTF = 9:1 wt.%) exhibited an enhanced short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.95 ± 1.03 mA cm-2 and a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 5.4 ± 0.17% because of the improved charge transport and accessibility for the electrolyte ions. In addition, the TNP/PTF photoelectrode showed excellent light absorption in the visible region because of the mountainous nature of light induced by the PTF light scattering layer. The TNP/PTF photoelectrode showed the highest Jsc (16.96 ± 0.79 mA cm-2), η (5.9 ± 0.13%), and open circuit voltage (Voc, 0.66 ± 0.02 V)."
