Here we report on the high-quality genome sequence of <italic>T. horrida</italic>; it is composed of 23.2&#x02009;Mb that encode 7,729 predicted genes and 6,973 genes supported by RNA-seq. The genome contains few repetitive elements that account for 8.45% of the total. Evolutionarily, <italic>T. horrida</italic> lies close to the <italic>Ustilago</italic> fungi, suggesting grass species as potential hosts, but co-linearity was not observed between <italic>T. horrida</italic> and the barley smut <italic>Ustilago hordei</italic>. Genes and functions relevant to pathogenicity were presumed. <italic>T. horrida</italic> possesses a smaller set of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolites, which probably reflect the specific characteristics of its infection and biotrophic lifestyle. Genes that encode secreted proteins and enzymes of secondary metabolism, and genes that are represented in the pathogen-host interaction gene database genes, are highly expressed during early infection; this is consistent with their potential roles in pathogenicity. Furthermore, among the 131 candidate pathogen effectors identified according to their expression patterns and functionality, we validated two that trigger leaf cell death in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. In summary, we have revealed new molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution, biotrophy, and pathogenesis of <italic>T. horrida</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the scientific and technological research program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJ15012017)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is an economically important seed plant and the most important cereal food crop in the world; it provides approximately 20% of the world&#x02019;s dietary energy supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Rice kernel smut (RKS), caused by the soil-borne Basidiomycete fungus <italic>Tilletia horrida</italic> that infects rice floral organs, was first reported in Japan in 1896<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. RKS was once categorized as a minor disease with sporadic occurrence in rice-growing areas; however, the increasing demand for rice worldwide keeps driving the extensive planting of high-yielding cultivars and hybrid varieties. In China, the cultivated area of hybrid rice has reached about 1.6 million acres. In order to increase production, the breeding of three line hybrid rice that contains male sterile, maintainer, and restorer lines is undertaken. However, the rising incidence of exerted stigma in rice male sterile lines selected as part of the drive towards higher-yielding hybrid lines, increases the impact of RKS, which affects both the yield and quality of hybrid seed by producing masses of dark powdery teliospores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This has led to an annual 40% to 60% prevalence of RKS in hybrid rice fields and to a 5&#x02013;20% decrease in rice yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Disease incidence as high as 87% and 100% in hybrid rice fields has been reported in Pakistan and China, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. RKS is now an increasing threat to rice cultivation in Asia, Oceania, Europe, America and Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Smuts are multicellular fungi, which exist as dark, thick-walled teliospores that are widespread in soil and the seeds of host plants. The morphological characters of 80 smut genera (4, 200 species) have been described and all species are parasitic on higher plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. They infect many economically important hosts including maize, barley, wheat, rice, sugarcane, and forage grasses. The smut fungi have originated from two phylogenetically separate lines; <italic>Tilletia</italic> has different origins to <italic>Ustilago</italic> and <italic>Sporisorium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4"><italic>T. horrida</italic> belongs to the <italic>Tilletia</italic> genus of the basidiomycota <italic>Tilletiaceae</italic> family. It possesses one nucleus per cell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and initiates infection through rice floral organs and the immature kernels, producing powdery dark teliospore balls in the rice kernels during the late phase of infection. Teliospore balls are black and spherical, measuring 25<sub>&#x002dc;</sub>30&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;23<sub>&#x002dc;</sub>30&#x02009;<italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m, and possess colorless indentations on their surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The spores can survive for more than 1 year in the soil, and for more than 3 years in rice seed that has been infected at the flower stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. On germination, the teliospores produce a promycelium (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) that display distal verticillated digitations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Microspores grow in these verticillated digitations and the appearance of these secondary microspores is linear or curved (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>). The early infective stage of <italic>T. horrida</italic>, remains asymptomatic, and the organism grows systemically until masses of dark powdery spores appear on the grains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g,h</xref>). Besides infecting <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, <italic>T. horrida</italic> is known to infect wild rice and certain weeds, and this may aid the spread of inocula to healthy rice plants at the flowering stage. Because <italic>T. horrida</italic> fungi are biotrophic pathogens, their growth on artificial media is slow. Studies on this species have predominantly focused on morphological characteristics and its evolutionary biology. To date, genomic structure and pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>T. horrida</italic> have not been studied.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the <italic>Tilletia horrida</italic> strain.
