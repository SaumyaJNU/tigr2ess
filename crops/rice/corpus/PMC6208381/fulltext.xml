Large amounts of high-mannose glycans such as Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, and Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (Man7/8/9), which can be favorably modified by chemical conjugation of mannose-6-phosphate, are desirable for lysosomal enzyme targeting. This study proposed a rice cell-based glycoengineering strategy using two different mannosidase inhibitors, kifunensine (KIF) and swainsonine (SWA), to increase Man7/8/9 glycoforms of recombinant human acid &#x003b1;-glucosidase (rhGAA), which is a therapeutic enzyme for Pompe disease. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effects of the mannosidase inhibitors and to evaluate the synergistic effect of glycoengineering on rhGAA. Both inhibitors suppressed formation of plant-specific complex and paucimannose type <italic>N</italic>-glycans. SWA increased hybrid type glycans while KIF significantly increased Man7/8/9. Interestingly, the combination of KIF and SWA more effectively enhanced synthesis of Man7/8/9, especially Man9, than KIF alone. These changes show that SWA in combination with KIF more efficiently inhibited ER &#x003b1;-mannosidase II, resulting in a synergistic effect on synthesis of Man7/8/9. In conclusion, combined KIF and SWA treatment in rice cell culture media can be an effective method for the production of rhGAA displaying dominantly Man7/8/9 glycoforms without genetic manipulation of glycosylation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><award-id>NRF-2013M3A9B6075887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Hong-Yeol</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Heajin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sun-Dal</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Jun-Young</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program of the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea (Systems and Synthetic Agrobiotech Center; grant no.

Plant cell culture systems have gained increasing attention as a next generation recombinant protein expression platform since they have several benefits, including animal-free production, cost-effective bioprocessing, application of current good manufacturing process, and mammalian-like post-translational modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, differences between plant and human glycans represent a major challenge to the practical use of plant expression systems. Due to differences in the final steps of the biosynthetic pathway, plant <italic>N</italic>-glycans lack &#x003b2;1,4-galactose, core &#x003b1;1,6-fucose, and sialic acid but contain potentially immunogenic &#x003b2;1,2-xylose and core &#x003b1;1,3-fucose. In addition, plant complex <italic>N</italic>-glycans are often capped with Lewis a epitope [Fuc&#x003b1;1- 4(Gal&#x003b2;1-3)GlcNAc-R]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, in order to create safe and effective plant-derived biopharmaceuticals, the plant <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway should be modulated.</p><p id="Par3">A deficiency of acid &#x003b1;-glucosidase (GAA) which hydrolyses glycogen to glucose in the lysosome causes Pompe disease with the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes. GAA is a glycoprotein of 110&#x02009;kDa with seven glycosylation sites which is targeted to the by the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (M6PR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Therefore, to develop therapeutic proteins for lysosomal storage disorders, it is essential to generate terminal M6P glycans on therapeutic proteins for M6PR-mediated pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, except for Gaucher disease which requires terminal mannose for uptake by the mannose receptor. In the M6PR-mediated pathway, <italic>in vitro</italic> M6P chemical conjugation depends upon the number of terminal mannoses containing &#x003b1;1,2-glycosidic linkages, which are potential phosphorylation sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Glycoengineering could modify glycan structures to improve therapeutic function using various strategies such as genetic engineering or use of glycoprocessing inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

One complementary strategy to genetic engineering techniques is the design of culture media, which can be readily implemented into other glycoprotein expression systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

We employed a design of experiment (DoE) approach using response surface methodology to investigate the effects of two inhibitors on HM glycan profiles. To quantify the effects of the inhibitors and evaluate the synergistic effect on glycan profiling of rrhGAA, glycovariants derived from each condition were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) with fluorescence detection and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) labeling.

Response surface models for Man7/8/9 contents in rrhGAA was established using KIF and SWA as input variables, thus enabling prediction of optimal concentrations of KIF and SWA to achieve the target level of Man7/8/9 with statistical confidence and further understanding of the interactions among the inhibitors behind the relevant mechanism.</p><p id="Par16">Most <italic>N</italic>-glycan in rrhGAA produced in the wild-type control (#11) was fully processed in the Golgi apparatus and vacuole, resulting in abundant plant specific complex type and paucimannose type glycans.

KIF treatment yielded smaller amounts of Man8 isomer B, a product of ERMI, than Man8 isomers A and C, which can be rapidly degraded by GMI in wild-type rice cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The increased concentration of KIF from 2.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M to 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;M elevated Man9 levels and reduced Man8 isomer B level. There was a minor amount of hybrid type glycans (1.9~2.0%), confirming that KIF can act as a weak inhibitor of GMII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, SWA conditions (#4 and #8) resulted in mainly hybrid type glycans and HM glycans composed of Man6 and Man7, possibly due to potent GMII inhibition and minor ERMII inhibition. This study demonstrated for the first time that the combination of KIF and SWA (#2, #3, #5, #6, #9 and #10) strongly inhibited the mannose trimming pathway related to ERMI, GMI, and ERMII in the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway of rice cells and led to dramatic increases in Man7/8/9 of rrhGAA derived from rice cells (up to 80.3%). The amount of Man9 was most prominently affected among HM glycans in response to the combination of SWA and KIF compared to SWA or KIF treatment alone. As high contents of Man7/8/9 glycans are critical for efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> M6P chemical conjugation to enhance M6PR-mediated uptake pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, this result is valuable for improving the quality of the rrhGAA producing-rice cell culture process. Interestingly, addition of SWA to rice cell culture in the presence of KIF altered the relative distribution of Man8 isomers. The amount of Man8 isomer C, which is the major structure among Man8 isomers produced by KIF alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), decreased while the amount of Man8 isomer A increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Man8 isomer A, the product of endomannosidase, is able to circumvent the glycosylation process inhibited by SWA and KIF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This result provides evidence that SWA could act as a potent ERMII inhibitor only when treated along with KIF, as SWA treatment alone was insufficient to block ERMII. In addition, hybrid type glycans, which were the most abundant glycan species in SWA alone, accounted for only 1.8~3.8% of rrhGAA obtained from the combination of SWA and KIF. It is highly possible that the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation process was more efficiently arrested at Man8 and Man9 in the ER by the combination of SWA and KIF, suggesting that SWA is not effective in producing hybrid type glycans in the Golgi apparatus. Despite the stronger effect of KIF on HM glycan formation, KIF treatment in rice cell cultures had a negative effect on culture performance parameters such as cell mass, cell viability, and rrhGAA titer. In contrast, SWA did not significantly impair these cell culture profiles or HM glycan formation. Although these combination conditions had a negative effect on cell culture performance, these impacts were not worse compared to KIF alone.</p><p id="Par17">We found that the combination of KIF and SWA dramatically increased HM glycan contents on rrhGAA compared to each of the inhibitors alone, which has not been previously reported. Interestingly, this approach successfully eliminated plant-specific glycan variants in rrhGAA, thus overcoming the major drawback of plant cell culture systems for mammalian protein production. Moreover, detailed analysis of glycovariants enabled to understand the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pathway in callus-derived suspension rice cells (<italic>O. sativa</italic>), thereby providing more information on recombinant protein development in the rice cell culture platform (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

While knock-out approach such as <italic>gnt1</italic> mutant used in this study may be efficient to modulate phenotypes in on/off mode, media optimization approach with specific enzyme inhibitors can offer more rapid and flexible operating space identification depending on the target quality attributes, thus rendering economic benefits in the rice cell culture process development.

The following gradient conditions were applied: t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02009;min, 25% solvent A (0.5&#x02009;mL/min); t&#x02009;=&#x02009;46.5, 50% solvent A (0.5&#x02009;mL/min); t&#x02009;=&#x02009;48, 100% solvent A (0.25&#x02009;mL/min); t&#x02009;=&#x02009;49, 100% solvent A (0.25&#x02009;mL/min); t&#x02009;=&#x02009;50, 25% solvent A (0.5&#x02009;mL/min); t&#x02009;=&#x02009;63, 25% solvent A (0.5&#x02009;mL/min). The peaks were calibrated by running an external standard of 2AB-labeled dextran ladder (2AB&#x02013;glucose homopolymer, Ludger Ltd) and the preliminary identification were performed using GlycoStore database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glycostore.org">www.glycostore.org</ext-link>). The individual structures of <italic>N</italic>-glycans were confirmed by HILIC separation coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>MALDI-TOF MS analysis of <italic>N</italic>-glycans</title><p id="Par25">MALDI-TOF MS was performed with the Ultraflex III system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) controlled by Flex Control 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics). The mass spectra were measured with reflectron positive ionization mode within 500&#x02013;3,000&#x02009;Da. For all analyses, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the matrix at a concentration of 10&#x02009;mg/mL in acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v). Dried 2AB-labeled glycans were dissolved in water, and each sample solution (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;L) was mixed with appropriate matrix solution (1&#x02009;&#x003bc;L). These samples were then loaded onto the stainless steel target and dried at room temperature.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
