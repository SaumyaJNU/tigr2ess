synthetic fertilizers. In this study, we researched on the development and use of a vertical semi-closed airlift photobioreactor (PBR) for microalgal cultivation and subsequently determined the efficacy of microalgae-based fertilizers to rice plant growth. The PBR system was developed to produce two strains of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria (<italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. UTEX 2576, <italic>Nostoc muscorum</italic> UTEX 2209S), and a polyculture of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (UTEX 2714) and <italic>Scenedesmus dimorphus</italic> (UTEX 1237). When these biofertilizers were evaluated for rice under the greenhouse conditions, results showed that the rice plant heights treated with polyculture-based microalgal biomass were similar to or better than the urea treatment. The effects of the inoculation of the N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacterial inoculation on seedling growth was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the vertical semi-closed system PBR cultivation method developed in this study proved to be a simple and effective method for cultivating microalgae. Demonstration of the reliable production system for N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes at a medium scale could potentially open the future application of microalgal biofertilizers in rice production.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important limiting factors in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) production. Since rice is grown under anaerobic conditions, application efficiency of inorganic N is low due to losses by ammonia volatilization and denitrification[<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Conventional rice production heavily relies on large applications of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers that adversely impact on environment through contribution to eutrophication zones, and methane emissions from rice fields [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One example of sustainable alternatives is the biological application of organic N derived from N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria in tropical [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and temperate rice-growing regions [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

We demonstrated that microalgal biomass resulted in a significant improvement in plant height under greenhouse conditions and addressed the limitations of the PBR system. The main limiting factors associated with a large scale cultivation of microalgae include capital costs of PBR, contamination of the culture with competitors and predators, stochastic weather patterns that influence light availability and growth kinetics, demand for a large amount of water, and energetic and economic costs associated with harvesting and downstream processing [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There are innate difficulties in implementing live N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria for the conventional rice production where high yields are derived from high chemical input. Common management practices for convention rice production likely affect effectiveness of microalgae-based biofertilizers. Addition of mineral N by synthetic fertilizers can limit the biological nitrogen fixation potential by cyanobacteria [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Frequent use of herbicides also can be detrimental to cyanobacteria introduced [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>We developed a novel vertical semi-close PBR tailored for microalgae biofertilizer production and demonstrated its potential application for rice cropping system. When compared to the other PBR designs for growing microalgae, this apparatus features the following unique characteristics in applicability and prevention of contamination from competitor algae or predators such as rotifer or chytrid. First, this PBR can be reused between batch harvests, therein decreasing overall costs compared to disposable hanging bag PBR designs. Second, the thin wall transparent PVC pipe contains an ultraviolet protectorant during the extrusion process, therein increasing the lifetime of the clear pipe in an outdoor setting compared to non-protected transparent polyethylene, acrylics, or other plastics commonly used in PBR design. Third, the inner wall of the transparent PVC pipe is smoothed during the extrusion process, therein helping mitigate fouling due to biofilm formation and reducing the times needed during maintenance and cleaning, when compared to traditionally extruded plastics. Forth, when compared to glass PBR, this PBR is more resistance to shattering during installation, cultivation, and maintenance procedures. The thin wall transparent PVC used in this study is resistant to shattering from environmentally damaging effects like hail, which can destroy glass or bagged PBR. Fifth, this PBR is designed with a 7.62-cm radius, which provides an adequate balance between light availability, temperature control, capex, and surface area to volume ratio [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Larger diameter PBR designs can limit culture density due to an increased optical path. In the other extreme, smaller diameter PBR designs can lack enough volume to maintain a homeostatic temperature under full sunlight, therefore causing catastrophic detriment to the culture, as seen in small volume tubular and flat-plate reactor designs. Sixth, the top manifold aeration used in this PBR prevents leaking due to degradation of inlet and accidental siphoning into an air pump due to a power outage or loss of pressure from the aeration pump. The airline can be easily disconnected from the pump and dual-used as a sampling port. By connecting a luer lock syringe to the airline, culture samples can be collected without having to open or expose the culture to the ambient environment, therein helping mitigate contamination events. Seventh, harvesting from the bottom of the bell end reducer allows for a quick and easy process that does not expose the interior of the reactor to the outside environment, which helps mitigate contamination events. Eighth, this PBR uses the modular design to mitigate contamination associated with microalgal production. Because the PBR do not share a common manifold, algal culture is never shared between PBR units in an array. Therefore, if a contamination event occurs in a single reactor, it can be sanitized immediately upon recognition of the contamination, therein protecting the remainig cultivation facility. This modular design is not present in open ponds, serpentine reactors, or other designs that share some form of pumping or harvesting manifolds.</p><p>An individual PBR developed in this study could produce 15 L microalgae culture within one week. Production of a polyculture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vularis</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>dimorphus</italic> inside the PBR was effective due to the robust fast growing nature of these strains that do not cause coagulation during culture compared to the filamentous cyanobacteria. Microalgae production in this PBR was consistent and reliable. Peak productivities can be maintainable or achievable under controlled environments without the problems that arise from outdoor open pond algal production systems such as susceptibility to predation, competition from aggressive endemic species, overflowing from rainfall and water loss by evaporation [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Another advantage of this PBR was to maintain optimal conditions of microalgae growth by continuous harvest and monitoring. This PBR is designed to harvest in a batch-wise manner prior to stationary phase, defined as the state at which net growth ceases altogether. In this manner, the optimal batch harvest system is designed to maintain the balance of growth of culture during its exponential rate, identified as the inflection point during the exponential growth phase. The culture is harvested prior to reaching its maximum density, the point at which the culture asymptotically begins to reach stationary phase and zero net growth. By harvesting in this manner, a culture density reached that is sufficient for downstream processing and cross-inoculation into another PBR.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges associated with the cultivation of microalgae at this scale was obtaining accurate measurements under rapidly changing culturing conditions. Real-time monitoring and enhanced equilibration of the PBR conditions will increase growth rate and improve monetary and energy efficiency to the system. Further improvements in this PBR design include an inline pH meter and a near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer for measuring cultivation conditions inside the PBR. Based on real-time information, the important growth parameters, such as CO<sub>2</sub> input and degree of aeration throughout the tube, can be timely adjusted, therein guiding proper decision-making for addition of fresh nutrients and harvesting of cells. Also, rather than relying on stock media recipes such as BG-11 and BG-11-0 for N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria, optimization of the individual macro-, minor-, and micro-nutrients for a particular microalgal strain can facilitate the cultivation efficiency.</p><p>This cultivation technique based on this PBR made it feasible to introduce microalgae-driven fertilizers to promote rice production. We evaluated the two microalgal fertility approaches: microalgae biomass and inoculation of live N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria. The application of microalgae biomass demonstrated its benefit in rice seedling growth. Its effect increased as the amount of applied microalgal biomass increased. This indicates that the use of microalgal biomass can provide a biological option for rice fertility program, which is especially important for organic rice production where synthetic fertilizers cannot be used. However, the effect of the inoculation of live N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria into flooded conditions, where rice plants are adopted, could not be confirmed in this study, addressing the complex ecological and environmental challenges that we have to overcome for future use of cyanobacterial introduction to rice production. Most of all, a better understanding about environmental factors associated with microalgae in rice paddy is necessary to solve the problems in the application of the algal fertilizer.</p><p>There have been numerous field studies reporting beneficial effects of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing microalgae inoculation as biofertilizers in rice growing regions in Asia since 1960&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Among recent examples, cyanobacteria inoculation increased rice yields by 5 to 24.1% in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and by 12.3 to 19.5% in India [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cyanobacterial contribution to nitrogen fixation was estimated between 20 to 500 &#x003bc;mol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> acetylene reducing activity per crop cycle [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. When assuming a 4:1 ratio of acetylene reduction to atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> fixed, these results can be extrapolated to 0.2 to 50 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>. Field introduction with <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. could incorporate 20 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> into rice [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there is still limited information on the dynamics of the transfer of atmospherically fixed nitrogen from cyanobacteria to rice under complexed field conditions [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Ineffectiveness of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria inoculation indicates that the success of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria introduction is contingent on various biological and environmental factors that limit its benefits [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> fixation by cyanobacteria is a metabolic process that costs high energy consumption and tends to decrease in the presence of exogenous N sources [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Subsequent decomposition of bacterial cells into plant available forms of N has to be followed. This process can take time. Environmental conditions associated with biological processes in the decomposition of algae biomass and the release of nutrients may be suboptimal, and so necessary nutrients cannot be provided properly and timely in coordination with plant growth. Meanwhile, abiotic stress, predators, competitors and diseases can reduce cyanobacteria density, therein making initial establishment of inoculated strains and propagation difficult [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Rice canopy also affects the growth of cyanobacteria, restricting the penetration of light to the water surface which limit microalgal growth and N fixation of cyanobacteria [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In some cases, even an adverse effect of microalgae on plant growth may occur due to the excretion of toxic secondary byproducts or unknown inhibitory factors [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Conventional rice production may not solely rely on microalgal biofertilizers but its use can add an option of socioeconomical- and ecological-sound alternative in the current rice management system in the United States, providing additional benefits to promote a sustainable rice farming. By utilizing wastewater effluent as a base medium for cultivating microalgae, it is possible to capture nutrients from a point pollution source like municipal water treatment facilities and recycle them into agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Performance of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria inoculation is likely influenced by microalgal strains, the application rate, time and frequency. It will be important to discover indigenous cyanobacterial isolates that are more adapted to the regional environment where they were collected [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and so their augmentation can be more successful in achieving yield increased as documented in row crops [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Consecutive inoculation in multiple years may be needed to increase the establishment and propagation of cyanobacteria inoculum in rice fields [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The microalgae biofertilizer treatments can also be possibly used in combination with synthetic N fertilizers [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additional benefit of rice cultivation with cyanobacteria is to ameliorate metal toxicity in both soil and rice plants because cyanobacteria play a role in sequestering the toxic metal loads alongside the ecosystem service of N<sub>2</sub> fixation [<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203456.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, cyanobacteria may enhance the edibility and safety of rice cultivated under soil conditions with nitrogen deficiency and toxic metal abundance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The vertical semi-closed PBR developed in this study was proved to be an effective method of microalgae cultivation. Such a scale-up cultivation of microalgae makes future increased applications of microalgal fertilizers to the rice production. Growth improvement of rice seedlings by addition of microalgal biomass was observed under the controlled environment, but beneficial effects of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing cyanobacteria inoculation treatment were limited. A potential of microalgae biofertilizer has been suggested, but their implementation in the conventional rice production in the United States still faces a challenge. Further ecological research is needed for better adopting and integrating algae-based fertilizers with current rice fertility programs required for the conventional or organic rice production. The combined use of microalgal biofertilizers and synthetic fertilizers has a merit to achieve sustainable productivity and applicability for rice production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203456.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Linear regression models for microalgal growth by optical density (OD).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203456.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203456.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Linear regression models for microalgal growth by dry weight.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203456.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203456.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Analysis of variance of rice seedling growth after the microalgal treatments.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203456.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the UTEX Culture Collection of Algae for providing the algal cultures.
