    "Adzuki beans are used to prepare foods with glutinous and non-glutinous rice in Japan, and adzuki bean pigments are able to color rice starch a purplish red. This study deals with the adzuki bean extract-dependent suppression of starch digestion of non-glutinous rice flour (joshinko in Japanese), which was gelatinized in boiling water and then cooled to 37 °C. Accompanying the treatment of joshinko with pancreatin, amylose and amylopectin were released from the joshinko particles, and the released amylose and amylopectin were further digested. The adzuki extract suppressed the release and digestion by binding to amylose and amylopectin, which were present in the particles and at the surfaces of the particles. Fatty acids and flavonoids in the adzuki extract contributed to the suppression. In addition, the starch digestion in the joshinko particles appeared to be suppressed if the amylose/fatty acid complexes and amylose/flavonoid and amylopectin/flavonoid complexes, which are poor substrates of α-amylase, surrounded the particles. It is discussed that the suppression was due to the prevention of α-amylase access to the particles."
