This study deals with the adzuki bean extract-dependent suppression of starch digestion of non-glutinous rice flour (joshinko in Japanese), which was gelatinized in boiling water and then cooled to 37 &#x000b0;C. Accompanying the treatment of joshinko with pancreatin, amylose and amylopectin were released from the joshinko particles, and the released amylose and amylopectin were further digested. The adzuki extract suppressed the release and digestion by binding to amylose and amylopectin, which were present in the particles and at the surfaces of the particles. Fatty acids and flavonoids in the adzuki extract contributed to the suppression. In addition, the starch digestion in the joshinko particles appeared to be suppressed if the amylose/fatty acid complexes and amylose/flavonoid and amylopectin/flavonoid complexes, which are poor substrates of &#x003b1;-amylase, surrounded the particles.

Introduction</title><p>Adzuki bean is a normal food in Japan and is used in cooking with glutinous and non-glutinous rice to prepare sekihan and adzuki-meshi, respectively. The adzuki bean is also used to prepare the paste for sweets. In addition, flour of non-glutinous rice (joshinko in Japanese) is normally used to prepare various Japanese foods, including dumplings, uiroh (sweet jelly or pudding), kashiwa-mochi (rice cake wrapped with an oak leaf), kusa-mochi (rice cake mixed with boiled leaves of mugwort), etc. The latter two types of cakes are filled with adzuki bean paste. </p><p>It has been reported that adzuki contains health-promoting antioxidants, such as flavonoids and tocopherols [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and that the flavonoids are transferred to the rice when cooked with rice [<xref rid="B4-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recently, we have reported that a diethyl ether-extract of the adzuki bean can suppress starch digestion of the homogenates of cooked non-glutinous rice and that taxifolin, quercetin, and a purplish pigment vignacyanidin (a cyanidin-catechin conjugate) in the extract can contribute to the suppression [<xref rid="B5-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The efficiency of the suppression increases with the increase in hydrophobicity of the flavonoids, namely, taxifolin &#x0003c; quercetin &#x0003c; vignacyanidin, but it is difficult to distinguish the effects of the adzuki extract on the digestion between amylose and amylopectin [<xref rid="B5-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, when joshinko was used instead of homogenized rice, we noticed that it was possible to distinguish the digestion of amylose from amylopectin by measuring the absorption spectra of starch-iodine complexes. </p><p>This study deals with (i) the adzuki bean extract-dependent suppression of starch digestion in retrograding joshinko, which was catalyzed by &#x003b1;-amylase in pancreatin; (ii) the binding of adzuki components to amylose and amylopectin in retrograding joshinko; and (iii) the elucidation of the adzuki bean components that suppressed starch digestion. Taking the above results and the structures of retrograding joshinko particles into consideration, it is discussed that amylose/fatty acid complexes and amylose/flavonoid and amylopectin/flavonoid complexes can suppress starch digestion in the particles by surrounding them. The elucidation of the mechanism may provide some procedures to prepare foods using joshinko, the digestion of which is slow. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-foods-07-00128"><title>2.

Ohashi cv. erimo) were supplied by the Japan Pulse Foundation (Tokyo, Japan) and the Tokachi Agricultural Experiment Station (Tokachi, Japan). Flour of non-glutinous rice (joshinko) was obtained from Hinode-Seifun Co. (Kumamoto, Japan). (+)-Catechin, taxifolin, rutin, and quercetin were from Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and pancreatin from pig pancreas were from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. Co. (Osaka, Japan). Quercetin 7-<italic>O</italic>-glucoside and vignacyanidin were prepared from adzuki bean as reported previously [<xref rid="B8-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-foods-07-00128"><title>2.2. Preparation of Adzuki Extract</title><p>Two liters of water was added to 1 kg of dried adzuki bean and kept at 25 &#x000b0;C in the dark for about 15 h. Methanol (2 L) was added to the soaked adzuki bean after removing the water not absorbed by the bean. The adzuki bean in methanol was kept at 25 &#x000b0;C in the dark for 1 h with gentle shaking to extract components contained in the seed coat. This extraction was repeated twice. After combining the two methanol extracts, methanol was removed in vacuo and the pH of the remaining aqueous solution (about 700 mL) was adjusted to 3 by HCl to extract with 200 mL of ethyl acetate three times. Water not absorbed by the adzuki bean (about 500 mL) was extracted with 200 mL of ethyl acetate once after the pH was decreased to 3. The ethyl acetate extracts were combined and washed with 100 mL of 1% HCl five times. After removing the water of the combined ethyl acetate extracts with anhydrous sodium sulfate, ethyl acetate was evaporated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 2 mL of ethanol with 0.1% HCl and kept at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. Flavonoids in the extract were identified from their retention times, UV-visible absorption spectra, and mass spectra [<xref rid="B4-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; their amounts were calculated from the areas under the peaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-foods-07-00128"><title>2.3. Preparation of Retrograding Joshinko</title><p>Joshinko (0.5 g) was suspended in 50 mL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) with 0.15 M NaCl, and gently heated for 5&#x02013;6 min to start boiling. After gentle boiling for 2 min, the gelatinized joshinko was cooled to 37 &#x000b0;C in a water bath. The cooled joshinko was used for experiments as retrograding joshinko. Adzuki extract (0&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;L) was added to 1 mL of the retrograding joshinko (0.01 g mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and then incubated for 5 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. The reason that the volumes were selected was that 10 &#x003bc;L of adzuki extract, which was equivalent to 5 g of adzuki bean, significantly suppressed pancreatin-induced starch digestion under the conditions of this study. Retrograding joshinko with and without adzuki extract was centrifuged at about 1500&#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 2 min. The supernatants and sediments were reddish purple and purple, respectively. The purple sediments were washed once with 1 mL of the above buffer solution and then suspended in 0.9 mL of the buffer solution. In the following experiments, the samples used were (1) retrograding joshinko, (2) the sediment, and (3) the supernatant. Starch digestion was initiated by adding 5 or 10 &#x003bc;g of pancreatin mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 37 &#x000b0;C. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-foods-07-00128"><title>2.4.

As large joshinko particles were precipitated rapidly after the addition of the reaction mixtures prepared from samples (1) and (2), i.e., joshinko and the sediment, the absorption spectra of starch-iodine complex were recorded 1 min after the addition of the reaction mixtures using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer combined with an integrating sphere (MPS-2000) (Shimadzu). The path length of the measuring beam was 4 mm.

Starch Digestion Estimated by Reducing Sugar Formation</title><p>The pancreatin-induced reducing sugar formation in retrograding joshinko was suppressed by 5 and 10 &#x003bc;L of adzuki extract by about 50% and more than 95%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Rates of the reducing sugar formation in the sediment prepared with 5 and 10 &#x003bc;L of adzuki extract as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-foods-07-00128">Section 2.3</xref> were about 90% and 40%, respectively, of that in the sediment prepared without the adzuki extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). On the other hand, the rates of the supernatant prepared in the presence of 5 and 10 &#x003bc;L of adzuki extract were about 20% and 10%, respectively, of that prepared in the absence of the adzuki extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The quite slow reducing sugar formation was not due to the adzuki extract-dependent decrease in the starch concentrations. This was supported by the results, which showed the amounts of total sugar in the supernatant were equivalent to 2.58 &#x000b1; 0.02, 1.85 &#x000b1; 0.33*, and 1.46 &#x000b1; 0.03* mg of glucose (<italic>n</italic> = 3; * <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) when the supernatant was prepared in the presence of 0, 5, and 10 &#x003bc;L of adzuki extract, respectively. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f001">Figure 1</xref> suggest that the components in the adzuki extract could control starch digestion by interacting with amylose and/or amylopectin fragments, which could be separated from the joshinko particles by centrifugation. To further discuss the mechanisms of the suppression, starch digestion was studied using iodine.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-foods-07-00128"><title>3.2.

Two shoulders around 550 and 700 nm in the joshinko (A) and the supernatant (C) suggest the release of loosely bound amylose and amylopectin from the particles in the retrograding joshinko by the dilution to measure starch-iodine complex formation (I) and by centrifugation (II), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The joshinko used in this study was prepared by milling non-glutinous rice. Therefore, the presence of fragmented amylose and amylopectin in the flour is possible. In addition to these fragments, amylose in joshinko particles is supposed to move to the surface of starch granules present in the particles during gelatinization [<xref rid="B12-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

According to this result, the adzuki extract-dependent decrease in amylose concentration in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) was most likely due to the precipitation of amylose, which was combined with the adzuki components, by centrifugation.

Oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) acids were identified in the adzuki extract by the HPLC system described in Materials and Methods, and their concentrations in the extract were estimated to be 71.1 &#x000b1; 12.8, 4.8 &#x000b1; 1.4, and 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.6 mM (<italic>n</italic> = 3), respectively. Here, the concentration of oleic acid was much higher than that of linoleic acid, but it has been reported that the content of linoleic acid is greater than that of oleic acid in the adzuki bean [<xref rid="B23-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The digestion of amylopectin may be due to the greater decrease in amylose concentration relative to amylopectin concentration during the preparation of the supernatant in the presence of adzuki extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-07-00128-f002">Figure 2</xref>C).

The above results suggest that if the not easily digestible amylose and amylopectin surrounded the joshinko particles, starch digestion in the particles might be suppressed.

The latter result indicates that the adzuki extract could suppress starch digestion without inhibiting &#x003b1;-amylase activity as almost all of the adzuki components were bound to starch in the precipitate. The precipitate suppressed the initial release of starch, mainly amylopectin, from the sediment by 30&#x02013;40% and suppressed digestion of the released starch by about 70% (&#x025cf;).

These results support the postulation that amylose and amylopectin combined with adzuki components could suppress the release of amylopectin from the sediment and the digestion of the released amylopectin.

Conclusions</title><p>The present study indicated that fatty acids, quercetin, and vignacyanidin in the adzuki bean extract could suppress starch digestion in retrograding joshinko by binding to amylose and amylopectin in joshinko particles and that these compounds could also suppress the digestion of fragmented amylose and amylopectin present in the retrograding joshinko by forming complexes with them. It was found that starch fragments combined with fatty acids and flavonoids, which are poor substrates of &#x003b1;-amylase, could suppress the digestion of the starch in joshinko particles and starch fragments released from the particles by surrounding them. According to the findings, it is possible to prepare starch-containing foods using fatty acids and hydrophobic flavonoids, the digestion of which is slow. Although the structure of amylose/fatty acid complexes has been proposed [<xref rid="B22-foods-07-00128" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the structures of starch/flavonoid complexes are unclear, and the interactions between amylose/fatty acid complexes and starch/flavonoid complexes are also unclear. Further studies on the structures and the interactions are required to understand how starch/flavonoid complexes become poor substrates for &#x003b1;-amylase and how the digestion of easily digestible starch is suppressed effectively when amylose/fatty acid and starch/flavonoid complexes are added at the same time. </p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Investigation, S.H. and U.T.; Writing&#x02014;Original Draft Preparation, U.T.; Writing&#x02014;Review &#x00026; Editing, S.H.; Funding Acquisition, S.H.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K00836, and the Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology (2015, 2017).</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-foods-07-00128"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gohara</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira de Souza</surname><given-names>A.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomes</surname><given-names>S.T.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Evel&#x000e1;zio de Souza</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Visentainer</surname><given-names>J.V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsushita</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nutritional and bioactive compounds of adzuki bean cultivars using chemometric approach</article-title><source>Cienc.
