Intriguingly, although the number of expressed genes varied little, the domestic species generally exhibited lower gene expression diversity than did the wild species, and this lower diversity was observed for both domestic plants and different kinds of domestic animals including insect, bird and mammal in the whole-genome gene set (WGGS), candidate selected gene set (CSGS) and non-CSGS, with CSGS exhibiting a higher degree of decreased expression diversity. Moreover, different from previous reports which found 2 to 4% of genes were selected by human, we identified 6892 candidate selected genes accounting for 7.57% of the whole-genome genes in rice and revealed that fewer than 8% of the whole-genome genes had been affected by domestication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our results showed that domestication affected the pattern of variation in gene expression throughout the genome and generally decreased the expression diversity across species, and this decrease may have been associated with decreased genetic diversity.

Despite thousands of years of agricultural practices and 150&#x02009;years of scientific research since Darwin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], much effort is still necessary to reveal the general genetic basis underlying the domestication of animals and plants. In recent years several plant domestication genes have been identified, such as <italic>sh4</italic>, which reduced seed shattering in cultivated rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; <italic>PROG1</italic>, which affected tiller angle and the number of tillers in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; and <italic>fw2.2</italic>, which increased fruit size in domesticated tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, it has been postulated that mutations in a few loci might have contributed to major domestication traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Genome-wide scans for signatures of artificial selection further indicated that a small percentage of genes were affected during domestication, such as 2~4% of genes in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and 6.67% of genes in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and revealed that domestic species usually showed decreased genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and increased linkage disequilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] compared with its wild relatives.</p><p id="Par13">Although only a small percentage of genes might have been involved in domestication, well-domesticated species usually show extensive phenotypic and physiological changes that make them substantially different from their wild ancestors. Some studies have revealed that different genetic variations, including single nucleotide variants in both coding and regulatory regions, copy number variations, insertions and deletions, could explain the morphological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Conceivably, some of these genetic variations may result in morphological changes through changing the expression of genes. Therefore, the transcriptome, which is the connection between genotypes and phenotypes, might play a role during domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible to focus on genome-wide expression changes, and several studies have been conducted to find genome-wide expression differences during domestication by comparing the transcriptomes of domestic and wild species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, all these previous comparative transcriptomic studies focused on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between domestic and wild species, usually restricted in one species. Therefore, it is worth investigating whether or not domestic plants and animals show patterns at the transcriptome level similar to the decreased genetic diversity and increased linkage disequilibrium observed at the genomic level.</p><p id="Par14">In this study, we systematically generated and collected transcriptome data for three domestic animals, four cultivated plants and their corresponding wild progenitors, i.e., from a total of seven representative domestic-wild pairs. Interestingly, the gene expression diversity levels tend to be lower in domestic species than in corresponding wild species, and this decrease may be an important pattern related to expression level and may be the result of artificial selection for specific traits under domestication or for survival in the suitable environments associated with care provided by humans. In other words, domestication might have been a process in which some unnecessary variation in genetic expression was discarded to give rise to the traits that humans selected, fitting a &#x0201c;less is more&#x0201d; mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and in extreme cases, leading to domestication syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome data</title><p id="Par15">We sequenced the mRNA extracted from the panicles of 20 wild rice accessions (<italic>Oryza rufipogon</italic> and <italic>Oryza nivara</italic>) and 20 cultivated rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) accessions (including the <italic>indica</italic>, <italic>aus</italic>, <italic>aromatic</italic>, <italic>temperate japonica</italic> and <italic>tropical japonica</italic> cultivar groups) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1<bold>)</bold>, the stem apical meristems of 35 soybean samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2) including 10 wild soybean accessions (<italic>Glycine soja</italic>), 14 landraces and 11 improved cultivars and the silk glands of silkworms including 4 wild individuals (<italic>Bombyx mandarina</italic>) and 4 domestic accessions (trimolter silkworms of <italic>B. mori</italic>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3).

The average mapping depth for cotton pairs was approximately 42&#x000d7;, and that for the brain frontal cortex of dog and wolf both was approximately 16&#x000d7;. The ear, leaf and stem of maize and teosinte had an approximately 10&#x000d7; average mapping depth. Although the average mapping depths differed among the seven pairs, the average mapping depths were very similar between each domestic species and its corresponding wild species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S8).</p><p id="Par17">We also measured the expression level of all the genes of each pair with fragments per kilobases per million mapped reads (FPKMs) values. When the FPKM value is greater than 1, the gene is considered an expressed gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The number of expressed genes was not significantly different between the domestic species and their wild progenitors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7), suggesting that the number of expressed genes changed little during domestication. Other FPKM thresholds, such as 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 5, were also used to count the number of expressed genes and the conclusions remained the same as those for a threshold of 1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Variation of gene expression diversity</title><p id="Par18">Regular transcriptome analysis focuses more on DEGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but little is known about the global change of gene expression pattern during domestication. Here, we calculated the gene expression diversity, which represents the gene expression variation levels in a transcriptome and is measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], separately for the wild and domestic species.</p><p id="Par19">Interestingly, the expression diversity values for the whole-genome gene set (WGGS) of the domestic species were generally lower than those of the corresponding wild species.

The leaf gene expression diversity of maize was not significantly lower than that of teosinte (0.691 in maize vs 0.684 in teosinte, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92), and the stem gene expression diversity of maize was almost the same as that of teosinte (0.696 in maize vs 0.697 in teosinte). However, the ear of maize showed significantly lower expression diversity than that of its wild related species (5.1% decrease, 0.660 in maize vs 0.696 in teosinte, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8.776e-14) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For soybean, the gene expression diversity of landraces (0.487) and improved cultivars (0.482) were very similar to that of the wild species (0.485) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Given the fact that the soybean landraces and improved cultivars sampled in this study experienced similar depletion of genetic diversity to other domestic species (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S12), it is unknown why soybean didn&#x02019;t show decreased gene expression diversity during domestication. One explanation is that soybean may experience unique diverse selection, as indicated by different traits of stem, leaf and photoperiod sensitivity in different landrace and cultivar groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, our samples were from different distinct groups (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). To initially test this hypothesis, we randomly chose four samples from a single group landraces and four wild soybean accessions to calculate gene expression diversity, and found that the four landraces indeed showed significantly decreased expression diversity (2.5% decrease, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;3</sup>) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2a), indicating specific genetic background may also function in the decrease of gene expression diversity in soybean although the effect may not be as strong as in other domestic species. In addition to the domestic species in this study, previously reported data showed that the gene expression diversity of the common bean is 18% lower than that of its wild related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

To test this, we mapped the reads of rice by using the reference genome of the wild species, <italic>O. nivara</italic> (GCA_000576065.1), and analysed the gene expression diversity of the wild and cultivated rice. The degree of decreased gene expression diversity of the cultivated species (1.054) compared to the wild species (1.205) was even higher (12.5% decrease, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2e-16) than that obtained using the genome of <italic>Oryza japonica</italic> as the reference (5.1% decrease, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.1e-12) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4), indicating that a lower mapping ratio may underestimate the expression diversity of wild species and the degree of decreased expression diversity when the genome of domestic species is used.

For the CSGS, pair-wise comparisons between domestic and wild species of dog, silkworm, rice, cotton, landrace soybean and maize (ear) revealed significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) lower expression diversity in the domestic species. In addition, both subgenomes of cotton, namely, the At (17.2% decrease) and Dt (21.9% decrease) subgenomes (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S11), had significantly lower expression diversity in the domestic species for the CSGS. Unlike in the WGGS, the landraces of soybean showed significantly decreased expression diversity in the candidate domesticated gene set (5.6% decrease, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Intriguingly, the non-CSGS also generally showed lower expression diversity in domestic species than in their corresponding wild counterparts (except in soybean and in the leaf of maize) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6), although the degree of decrease was weaker than that for the CSGS, with only a single exception in the silkworm (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S11). These results suggested that the CSGS contributed more to the decreased expression diversity of the WGGS than did the non-CSGS. Moreover, for the two subgenomes of cotton, the Dt exhibited a higher degree of decreased expression diversity than did the At in both the WGGS (17.0% decrease in Dt vs 15.9% decrease in At) and CSGS (21.9% decrease in Dt vs 17.2% decrease in At) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>:Table S11), indicating that the Dt genome of cotton may have experienced stronger artificial selection than the At subgenome, which is consistent with the previous conclusion based on whole-genome resequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These results suggest that artificially selected genes played a major role in the decrease of gene expression diversity during domestication, but the expression diversity of non-selected genes was also affected during domestication.</p><p id="Par26">Furthermore, besides the XP-CLR methods used above, we also identified candidate selective sweeps in rice based on two other methods, namely, population differentiation (Fst) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the ratio of genetic diversity (&#x003c0;<sub>wild</sub>/&#x003c0;<sub>dome</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] between the wild and domestic species, to explore whether the methods used to identify the candidate selective sweeps affected the pattern found in the CSGS. All the CSGS genes identified with the three different methods showed a higher degree of decreased expression diversity than those in the WGGS (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S7), indicating that the method did not have much effect on the observed pattern in the CSGS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">In 2012, using array hybridization, Hufford et al. observed decreased variation in the gene expression of candidate selected genes of domestic and improved maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In 2014, Bellucci et al. used RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly to investigate the genetic and expression diversity of common bean and its wild related species and observed that the domestic common bean had lower genetic and gene expression diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, the ancestor of lettuce also showed higher expression diversity than each of the six horticultural subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. These three pioneering reports led to the question of whether the decrease of gene expression diversity is a general pattern in all or most domestic species. In this study, we collected reference genomes as well as statistically sufficient transcriptome datasets (more than 4 replicates for each tissue) of 4 domestic crops and 3 domestic animals to exclude the problem of sampling and data bias. Our comprehensive analysis shows that domestication does generally reduce gene expression diversity in both domestic plants and different kinds of domestic animals including insects, birds and mammals.</p><p id="Par28">Previous population genomics studies and analysis on gene variation diversity in this study revealed that all the seven domestic species experienced decrease of genetic diversity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S12 - S13) compared to their wild relatives. The synchronous decrease of genetic diversity and gene expression diversity suggested that the reduction in expression diversity may have been a direct consequence of reduced genetic diversity during domestication. However, both bottleneck and selection can lead to a decreased genetic diversity. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which is the main force driving the decreased expression diversity. To discriminate these two forces, we further explored the relationships between the decreased percentages of genetic diversity and expression diversity in each gene and found that the decreased percentage of expression diversity had no linear relationship with the decreased percentage of genetic diversity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S8), suggesting that bottlenecks, which would reduce genetic diversity at the whole-genome level, may not be the major factor resulting in the decreased expression diversity.</p><p id="Par29">Furthermore, we also observed that the artificially selected genes experienced a severer decrease of gene expression diversity than did the WGGS and the non-CSGS, indicating that domestication-related selection may have been the main driver of the reduced expression diversity. Previous studies hypothesized that loss of expression diversity may be due to the stabilization of <italic>cis</italic>-regulated expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and it has been pointed out that almost half of the mutations affecting the domestic phenotypes were caused by the mutations located in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we further explored the effects of decreased genetic diversity in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements on the reduced expression diversity and scrutinized the results obtained by one previous study in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We chose 843 one-to-one regulated enhancer and gene pairs (which means that one enhancer can regulate only one gene and that this gene can be regulated by only that enhancer) in cotton, and calculated the genetic diversity of enhancers and expression diversity of the corresponding regulated genes. Both the genetic diversity of enhancers and the expression diversity of genes were significantly decreased in cotton (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9a). The number of enhancer-gene pairs that exhibited a synchronous decrease of genetic diversity and expression diversity accounted for the largest portion (32.7%) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9b). The second largest portion (25.7%) included the pairs in which the genetic diversity of the enhancer was unchanged but the expression diversity of the corresponding regulated gene was decreased. This kind of pairs may be affected by selected transcription factor genes because one such gene can interact with many loci and affect many genes&#x02019; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. All these results suggest that decrease of the genetic diversity of an enhancer was often accompanied with the decrease of expression diversity of the corresponding regulated gene in cotton, indicating that selection on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements may be an important force resulting in the decrease of expression diversity. However, some enhancer-gene pairs did not show synchronous decrease, this group of genes may not be selected in the identified enhancer but in other regulatory and even upstream <italic>trans-</italic>factors.</p><p id="Par30">Among the three tissues of maize, only the ears exhibited significantly decreased expression diversity in the WGGS and CSGS, and exhibited a higher degree of decreased expression diversity than did the stem and leaf in the CSGS (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This phenomenon may be because the ear, which is the most important tissue affecting crop yields, had been subject to stronger selection pressure than the stem and leaf during domestication, which also indicates that decreased expression diversity may have tissue-specific characteristics due to different selected traits. Intriguingly, we also found an important domestication genes&#x02014;KN-1, a transcription factor that affected the development of the cob [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and showed decreased expression diversity in the ears (maize: 0.239&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;teosinte: 0.402), further supporting the idea that domestication-related selection in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions may have been the driving force of the decreased expression diversity.</p><p id="Par31">Domestication, which is an evolutionary process that alters wild species to meet human needs, is often accompanied by many morphological and physiological changes. During this process, humans usually offer wild species a more stable and suitable environment than the harsh and variable environments in which the species previously lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] to facilitate the species&#x02019; growth and reproduction for food or other demands. Over generations of selection, the domestic species gradually gains adaptations to the suitable domestication environment, even if the adaptations were deleterious in the wild, such as the loss of shattering which made harvesting easier for farmers but prevented the spreading of seeds in the wild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and the loss of resistance to salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Although only a few genes are under selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], due to the complex interactions between genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and hitch-hiking effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] of many linked genes, the few selected genes may affect many other genes&#x02019; expression and then change the pattern of whole-genome gene expression. The reduced expression diversity (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) suggested that some genes had lost their variable expression profiles and thus might have lost their variable functions used to adapt to varied environments. Therefore, domestication might have lost variability in both genetic and gene expression level in order to enhance the human-preferred traits, and thereby in this sense domestication process may well fit the &#x0201c;less is more&#x0201d; model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the loss of both genetic diversity and expression diversity may make the domestic species vulnerable to the harsh wild environment and decrease their plasticity and eventually lead to domestication syndrome.</p><p id="Par32">Because the expression of genes is affected by many factors, the lower expression diversity in domestic species may also have been caused by suitable environments or the loss of some trans-factors. In addition, gene expression also showed spatiotemporal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and tissue-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] characteristics. Therefore, more evidence is necessary to support the pattern of decreased expression diversity during domestication. With the availability of more transcriptome data for more domestic species and their wild relatives in the future, the decrease of gene expression diversity may be supported by more examples in different species and different tissues, and it will be possible to clarify the driving force of reduced expression diversity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">In summary, our current study observed a global decreased gene expression diversity during domestication in addition to the decrease of genetic diversity.

Then RNA sequencing reads for each sample were mapped onto the corresponding reference genome using Bowtie 2.2.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and TopHat 2.0.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. After mapping, to ensure the comparison comparable, it is necessary to keep the domestic species and the wild species have the same number of samples especially when calculating the expression diversity because of the introduction of the concept of the variance (standard deviation). Therefore, for maize, soybean, cotton, chicken and dog, which have different number of samples in domestic species and the wild species (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we have chosen the samples which have more clean reads to keep the number of samples the same (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S8). In addition, to avoid the bias caused by the lower sequencing depth in the exonic regions, the raw reads of biological replicates of maize were merged together to improve the average mapping depth. The average mapping depths of the three tissues of maize pairs turned from 5&#x000d7; for each sample to 10&#x000d7; for each accession (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8). Finally, 6 maize accessions and 6 teosinte accessions were used to the following analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7). Samtools 0.1.19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] was used to calculate the mapping depths for each base in exonic regions and the average mapping depth for exons in the whole genome is calculated as the average depth of the bases located in those exons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p id="Par37">For each pair, the transcriptome data belonging to the domestic or wild species were treated as biological replicates for each group and Cufflinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] was used to normalize and calculate the expression level by the fragments per kilobases per million reads (FPKMs) method. After that, FPKM thresholds, such as 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, were used to identify the number of expressed genes and compare the number of expressed genes between the domestic and wild species in different threshold.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Expression diversity</title><p id="Par38">After the reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome by TopHat, the number of the reads mapped to each gene were counted by HTseq 0.6.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] with the default parameters, we used an R package named DESeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to calculate the expression level and normalize the expression level to reduce the bias due to different amplification during PCR. Each gene&#x02019;s expression diversity, which is also named coefficient of variation (CV), was calculated as the ratio between the SD (standard deviation) and the mean of the expression values, separately for domestic and wild species. And Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to test whether the expression diversity values in the domestic species are significantly lower than in the wild species in the WGGS, CSGS and non-CSGS. Finally, the expression diversity of each species was represented by the average value of the genes&#x02019; expression diversity. Considering that the SD and mean are easily affected by the number of samples, therefore we have chosen the samples which have more clean reads in the process of reads mapping to analyze the expression diversity (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S8).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Genetic diversity</title><p id="Par39">For the six domestic-wild pairs including dog, silkworm, rice, cotton and soybean, the transcriptome data used to calculate the expression diversity were also used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After raw reads were mapped to the reference genome with TopHat 2.0.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], Picard tools (v1.119, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) was used to remove the duplicated reads and the mpileup program in the SAMtools package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] was used to call the raw SNPs. The raw SNPs were filtered based on the following criteria: (1) the SNPs for which the total mapping depth or SNP quality was less than 30 were excluded; (2) only the biallelic SNPs were retained and the allele frequency had to be more than 0.05; (3) the genotypes with fewer than 3 supported reads and a genotype quality of less than 20 were treated as missing. The SNPs with more than 20% missing genotypes were excluded. After exclusion, each gene&#x02019;s genetic diversity was calculated based on Nei&#x02019;s methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>SNP calling and selective sweeps identification in rice</title><p id="Par40">To identify the candidate selective sweeps for rice, a total of 144 whole genome sequencing data which included 42 wild rice accessions from NCBI (PRJEB2829) and 102 cultivates accessions from the 3000 Rice Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were collected. The reads after the quality control were mapped to the reference genome (IRGSP-1.0.26) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa v0.7.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Then the mapped reads were converted into bam format and marked duplicates to lower down the biases due to PCR amplification with Picard tools (v1.119, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). After the program RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v3.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] were used to realign the reads around the indels, SNPs calling used the GVCF mode with HaplotypeCaller in GATK to produce an intermediate GVCF (genomic VCF) file for each sample. The final GVCF file which was acquired by merging the intermediate GVCF files together was passed to GenotypeGVCFs to produce a set of joint-called SNP and indel calls. Finally, the SNPs were selected and filtered with SelectVariants and VariantFiltration separately with the recommended parameters in GATK. The SNPs which have more than 30% were missing genotypes were excluded.</p><p id="Par41">After acquiring the genetic mutation profiles of rice, an updated cross-population composite likelihood ratio test (XP-CLR, updated version, acquired from the author) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], which is based on allele frequencies and deals with missing genotypes with an EM algorithm, was used to identify the candidate selective sweeps. A comparison between the cultivated population and the wild population was used to validate the selective sweeps that took place during domestication. The average physical distance per centimorgan (cM) was 244&#x02009;kb for rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], therefore, we used a 0.05&#x02009;cM sliding window with a 200&#x02009;bp step to scan the whole genome, and each window had a maximum 200 SNPs in rice. After scanning, the average scores in 100&#x02009;kb sliding window with 10&#x02009;kb steps in the genome were estimated for each region. The regions with the highest 5% of scores were regarded as candidate selected regions. Finally, the overlapping regions within the top 5% of scores were merged together and treated as one selective sweep region, and the genes located in or overlapping with the candidate selective sweeps according to the gene coordinates were regarded as candidate selected genes.</p><p id="Par42">Furthermore, we also used two other methods, namely, population differentiation (Fst) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the ratio of genetic diversity (&#x003c0;<sub>wild</sub>/&#x003c0;<sub>dome</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] between the wild and domestic species, to detect the candidate selective sweep regions in rice. VCFtools (version 0.1.13) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] was used to calculate the Fst between the wild and domesticated populations, and the genetic diversity of wild and domesticated populations. A 100&#x02009;kb sliding window with 10&#x02009;kb step in the genome was used. Then, the regions with an Fst value or genetic diversity ratio in the top 5% were treated as candidate selective sweep regions. Finally, the overlapping regions were merged, and the genes located in these regions were treated as candidate selected genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
