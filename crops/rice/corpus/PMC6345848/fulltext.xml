The host-range of <italic>R. solani</italic> spans numerous plant families including, but not limited to, wheat, rice, barley, canola, soybean, corn, potato and sugar beet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>R. solani</italic> colonizes different plant organs depending on the plant species; for example, leaves are infected in rice, whereas roots are infected in plants such as soybean, sugar beet and tomato. Because <italic>R. solani</italic> produces basidiospores under certain conditions, the fungus can be subdivided into anastomosis groups (AGs) based on hyphal anastomosis and physiological-biochemical characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To date, isolates of <italic>R. solani</italic> from plant species have been assigned to 13 AGs (AG1 to AG13), some of which include several subgroups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Rice sheath blight, one of the major three diseases of rice, is caused by <italic>R. solani</italic> AG-1 IA and rice brown sheath blight is caused by <italic>R. solani</italic> AG-2-2 IIIB.</p><p id="Par3">Despite the severe damage caused by <italic>R. solani</italic>, conventional breeding has had limited efficacy in introducing genetic resistance to <italic>R. solani</italic> in any crop species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. There is no rice cultivar that is fully resistant to <italic>R. solani</italic>; therefore, it is difficult to breed rice resistance to sheath blight using conventional breeding and selection methods. Genetic overexpression of several rice genes have been shown to confer resistance to <italic>R. solani</italic>, including <italic>OsACS2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, <italic>Os2H16</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, <italic>OsWRKYs</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and <italic>OsASR2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Because approximately 30% of rice genes are predicted to be members of clustered and redundant gene families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine their functions using loss-of-function (silencing) approaches.

A <italic>KLU/CYP78A5</italic> loss-of-function mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also showed an accelerated leaf initiation rate, suggesting that <italic>KLU/CYP78A5</italic> affects the plastochron as well as the organ size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The shortened plastochron duration was mostly due to the increased cell division rate. Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> also suggested the possibility that the plastochron duration and organ size are coordinately regulated by an unknown common regulator. Due to its sequence similarity at the protein level, the BSR2 protein may produce chemicals similar to the PLA1 or KLU proteins. Such chemicals may be responsible for the repression of leaf initiation observed and allow for the maintenance of an appropriate plastochron duration. <italic>BSR2</italic> overexpression could increase the production of such chemicals. This might suppress the rate of leaf initiation by decreasing the rate of cell division, leading to a longer plastochron and slower growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Possible function of BSR2</title><p id="Par32">Although some members of the CYP78As, such as CYP78A5, are known to affect seed size and plastochron, no member of the CYP78As has been reported as being involved in disease resistance. <italic>BSR2</italic>-KD rice displayed susceptibility to <italic>R. solani</italic> and had shorter seeds and faster growth than WT plants, probably due to a shorter plastochron. These data suggest that <italic>BSR2</italic> is involved in pleiotropic functions such as innate immunity, reproductive organ size and growth rate in rice.</p><p id="Par33">Our discovery and characterization of <italic>BSR2</italic> adds new insight into the biological roles of CYP78As, because, to our knowledge, no other CYP78A has such pleiotropic function. CYP78As are found in most angiosperm species and moss, suggesting that they have an ancient conserved role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This is the first report on disease resistance found by overexpression of a <italic>CYP78A</italic> (<italic>BSR2</italic>), and it is quite possible that other members of the CYP78A family play key roles in disease resistance as well.</p><p id="Par34">The biochemical function of BSR2 is unknown. <italic>Zea mays</italic> CYP78A1 has been reported as having lauric acid 12-monooxygenase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Similarly, CYP78A5, A7 and A10 have short-chain fatty acid hydroxylase activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. CYP78A5, A6, A9 and A11 act non-cell-autonomously; therefore, they are also thought to be involved in generating a novel mobile growth signal that is distinct from the classical phytohormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Analyses of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants of <italic>CYP78A9</italic> (one of the closest homologues of <italic>BSR2</italic>) have revealed perturbations in the flavonol biosynthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The same study found no clear overlap between the <italic>CYP78A9</italic>-regulated genes and known phytohormone-responsive genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, an earlier study found that no known phytohormone treatment could mimic the entire phenotype of <italic>CYP78A9</italic>-OX <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. No known phytohormone could also mimic the pleiotropic phenotype of <italic>BSR2</italic>-OX plants. Because CYP78As are involved in fatty acid and flavonol biosynthesis, it is conceivable that <italic>BSR2</italic> overexpression led to the activation of a novel biosynthetic pathway. Such a pathway could have several bioactive products that affect the phenotypes associated with BSR2 expression; including reproductive organ size, growth rate and disease resistance. In future, the biochemical function of BSR2 should be characterized. RNA sequencing analysis coupled with a metabolomic assay would shed light on which genes or gene products are activated by <italic>BSR2</italic> overexpression during the vegetative and reproductive stages and before and after infection by <italic>R. solani</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Applications for disease resistant crops</title><p id="Par35"><italic>BSR2</italic> may be useful for generating crop plants that have broad-spectrum disease resistance. Because <italic>BSR2</italic> was effectively expressed in both the monocot rice and the dicot <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it may be useful for generating many monocot and dicot crops. However, because <italic>BSR2</italic> overexpression led to notably reduced fertility in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, it would be useful to use promoters that prevent <italic>BSR2</italic> expression in the reproductive organs. Alternatively, the adoption of pathogen-inducible promoters like <italic>PR1b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> may be useful for preventing the growth retardation and low fertility that result from constitutive expression of <italic>BSR2</italic>.
