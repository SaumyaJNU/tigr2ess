    "Background:Sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB), comprising both a dermal layer and pith, is a solid waste generated by agricultural activities. Open burning was previously used to treat agricultural solid waste but is harmful to the environment and human health. Recent reports showed that certain techniques can convert this agricultural waste into valuable products. While SSB has been considered an attractive raw material for sugar extraction and the production of value-added products, the pith root in the SSB can be difficult to process. Therefore, it is necessary to pretreat bagasse before conventional hydrolysis. Methods:A thorough analysis and comparison of various pretreatment methods were conducted based on physicochemical and microscopic approaches. The responses of agricultural SSB stem pith with different particle sizes to pretreatment temperature, acid and alkali concentration and enzyme dosage were investigated to determine the optimal pretreatment. The integrated methods are beneficial to the utilization of carbohydrate-based and unknown compounds in agricultural solid waste. Results:Acid (1.5-4.5%, v/v) and alkali (5-8%, w/v) reagents were used to collect cellulose from different meshes of pith at 25-100 °C. The results showed that the use of 100 mesh pith soaked in 8% (w/v) NaOH solution at 100 °C resulted in 32.47% ± 0.01% solid recovery. Follow-up fermentation with 3% (v/v) acid and 6.5% (w/v) alkali at 50 °C for enzymolysis was performed with the optimal enzyme ratio. An analysis of the surface topography and porosity before and after pretreatment showed that both the pore size of the pith and the amount of exposed cellulose increased as the mesh size increased. Interestingly, various compounds, including 42 compounds previously known to be present and 13 compounds not previously known to be present, were detected in the pretreatment liquid, while 10 types of monosaccharides, including D-glucose, D-xylose and D-arabinose, were found in the enzymatic solution. The total monosaccharide content of the pith was 149.48 ± 0.3 mg/g dry matter. Discussion:An integrated technique for obtaining value-added products from sweet sorghum pith is presented in this work. Based on this technique, lignin and hemicellulose were effectively broken down, amorphous cellulose was obtained and all sugars in the sweet sorghum pith were hydrolysed into monosaccharides. A total of 42 compounds previously found in these materials, including alcohol, ester, acid, alkene, aldehyde ketone, alkene, phenolic and benzene ring compounds, were detected in the pretreatment pith. In addition, several compounds that had not been previously observed in these materials were found in the pretreatment solution. These findings will improve the transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into sugar to create a high-value-added coproduct during the integrated process and to maximize the potential utilization of agricultural waste in current biorefinery processing."
