    "Efficient, fast and new micro-analytical methods for characterization of ultrastructures of fungal spores with electron microscopy are very much required and essential. SEM analysis of biological materials, especially fungi, requires optimal preparation of the specimen and often requires the usage of dried samples which demands a challenging sample preparation. In the present investigation, we described a fast and improved method for the preparation of fungal specimen for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fungus, Curvularia lunata was grown on the surface of sterile Whatman No.1 filter paper which was overlaid on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium, gold coated immediately after removal from the growth medium and subjected to imaging. Generally, SEM imaging is done with samples that were fixed with chemical fixatives, dehydrated and gold coated specimens, but here we describe an easy and more efficient sample preparation for SEM which enabled enhanced image quality and precision visualization of fungal cells, especially the spores. The developed method has enabled the analysis of even the robust samples like fungal spores that to eliminating special temperature requirement. The ultimate goal was to develop an improved protocol/method applied to analysis of fungal spores with greater coverage about fungal specimen preparation. This method permits the use of rapid sample preparation and will allow us to imaging of individual spore or conidia structures in the context of fungal cell architecture which clarifies our understanding in fungal taxonomy/biology."
