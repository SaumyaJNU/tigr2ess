    "γ-Oryzanol (OZ), abundant in rice bran oil, has gained attention due to its physiological activities (e.g., lipid-lowering effects). However, the absorption and metabolism of orally ingested OZ have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, diets containing normal or high contents of OZ were fed to obesity model mice for 8 weeks, and OZ concentrations in plasma and organs were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. To evaluate the relationship between OZ accumulation and lipid metabolism in vivo, lipid concentrations in the mice plasma and liver were also measured. As a result, the accumulation of intact OZ in plasma and organs was seen in mice fed diets containing OZ, where mice fed diets containing higher OZ contents demonstrated higher levels of OZ accumulation and lower amounts of plasma lipids. These results, in combination with our additional data from a single oral administration test, suggest the possibility that intact OZ, along with its metabolites (e.g., ferulic acid), is biologically-active."
