However, the lack of a suitable transient expression vector has limited their utility. Here, by cloning and analyzing the promoter sequence of the gene encoding cytoplasmic actin from the leafhopper <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>, we successfully developed the first efficient transient expression vector for cultured leafhopper cells, which can also be used to express exogenous proteins in other insect culture cell lines, including those derived from <italic>Recilia dorsalis</italic> leafhopper and <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9). Furthermore, insertion of the <italic>Hr5</italic> viral enhancer element and knockdown of the endogenous <italic>Dicer2</italic> gene notably improved the vector&#x02019;s expression efficiency in leafhopper cells. Using the optimized vector, we have for the first time traced the cellular localization of the proteins encoded by rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV) in cells of its insect vector and demonstrated that P6 protein is a component of the viroplasm.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>actin</italic> promoter</kwd><kwd>transient expression vector</kwd><kwd>insect cultured cell</kwd><kwd>RYSV P6</kwd><kwd>viroplasm</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn4">National Key Research and Development Plan Foundation</funding-source><award-id rid="cn4">2018YFD0200306</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn3">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn3">31871931</award-id><award-id rid="cn3">31601602</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn2">Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100008766</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn2">xjq201705</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn1">Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003392</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn1">2017J05049</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="7099"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Planthoppers (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha) and leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) are the most destructive insect pests of rice in the temperate and tropical regions of East and Southeast Asia. They not only cause direct detrimental effects on plant growth, such as plant wilting and leaf chlorosis but also transmit several rice pathogens, including phytoplasma and plant viruses, that cause enormous economic loss every year (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Oya, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">S&#x0014d;gawa, 1982</xref>). Rice-infecting rhabdoviruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by leafhoppers (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2018b</xref>). These viruses possess complex genomes comprising a long negative-strand single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) and have complicated infection strategies (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dietzgen et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Lefkowitz et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). These features increase the difficulty of studying these viruses in both their host plants and insect vectors. Moreover, the limited number of technical innovations in insect systems thus far has seriously hampered research progress.</p><p>The first continuously cultured leafhopper cell line was established in 1964 (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hirumi and Maramorosch, 1964</xref>), and major improvements over the original cultured cells in the succeeding decades have made these cells an important tool for studying the behavior of rice viruses in their vector cells, including during viral entry, replication, and spread (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al., 2006a</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Ma et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Jia et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). To date, over 100 publications have been related to applications of leafhopper cultured cells. Despite this progress, no expression systems have been developed for cultured leafhopper cell lines, which have greatly limited the investigation of rice viruses.</p><p>Several systems are available for exogenous protein expression in other types of insect cells. These systems are divided into two major categories: 1) virus-based expression systems of which the baculovirus expression vector (BEV) system is the most successful, with thousands of recombinant proteins produced so far (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">van Oers et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and 2) viral gene promoter- or endogenous gene promoter-based expression vectors among which the lepidopteran nucleopolyhedrovirus <italic>immediately early 1</italic> (<italic>IE1</italic>) gene promoter fused with the <italic>homologous region 5</italic> (<italic>Hr5</italic>) enhancer (Hr5/IE1) is a successful example (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Viswanathan et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Unfortunately, none of these existing expression systems works in cultured leafhopper cells. The development of a leafhopper transient expression vector is a pressing need for the investigation of rice viruses and will considerably expand the research applications of cultured leafhopper cell lines.</p><p>Rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV), first reported in 1965&#x000a0;in Taiwan and southern China (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Chiu et&#x000a0;al., 1965</xref>), is the only rice-infecting nucleorhabdovirus in the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>; it is persistently transmitted by the leafhopper <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) and caused major reductions in rice yields in southern China from the 1970s to the 1980s (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Faan and Pui, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2018a</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The genome of RYSV is a single negative-strand RNA of 14,030 nucleotides that harbor seven open reading frames encoding seven proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), movement protein (P3), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), RNA silencing suppressor P6, and large RNA polymerase (L), in the order 3&#x02032;-N-P-3-M-G-6-L-5&#x02032;. The functions and cellular localizations of the plant rhabdovirus-encoded proteins in plant hosts have been extensively investigated for Sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV) (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Goodin et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), Potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), and RYSV (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Fang et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Luo et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Luo and Fang, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). However, less work has been done on the behavior of these viruses in their insect vectors. In particular, the lacks of suitable insect cell cultures and transient expression vectors have made it difficult to trace the infection of plant rhabdoviruses in cultured insect cells.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed a leafhopper <italic>cytoplasmic actin</italic> promoter and successfully used it to develop a transient expression vector, which was able to drive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in several insect cell culture lines, including different leafhopper cell lines and Sf9 cells. We then optimized this vector by inserting the <italic>Hr5</italic> enhancer and found that knocking down <italic>Dicer2</italic> to inhibit RNA interference (RNAi) also improved the expression efficiency of the construct. We used our new expression system to detect the cellular localizations of the RYSV proteins in leafhopper cells and demonstrated that the P6 protein of RYSV is a component of the RYSV viroplasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec3"><title>Cell Culture and Reagents</title><p>Continuous monolayer cultures of vector cells, including <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, <italic>Nephotettix apicalis</italic>, <italic>Recilia dorsalis</italic>, and Sf9, were prepared as previously described (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Ma et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

However, the lack of an efficient transient expression vector greatly impairs their application. In this study, we established and optimized the first leafhopper cell transient expression vector by cloning and analyzing the native promoter of the leafhopper <italic>cytoplasmic actin</italic> gene. Our <italic>actin</italic>-promoter-based vector was able to drive expression of GFP in various cell lines, including leafhopper and Sf9 cells. We also found that the expression efficiency of the exogenous protein was improved by the combination of the <italic>Hr5</italic> enhancer and knockdown of <italic>Dicer2</italic> transcription. Using our new transient expression vector, we determined for the first time the cellular localization of the proteins of a rice rhabdovirus, RYSV, in leafhopper cells. Through confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and RNAi, we demonstrated that the RYSV-encoded protein P6 is a component of the RYSV viroplasm and plays an important role in RYSV infection of its insect vectors.</p><p>As cell culture technology has matured, insect cell lines derived from more than 100 insect species have been established (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Lynn, 2001</xref>). However, most lack useful promoters for exogenous protein expression. In particular, there has been no transient expression vector for Hemiptera insect cell lines. Since we created the first brown planthopper (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) cell line in 2014 (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), great efforts have been made to construct an effective expression vector that works in these Hemiptera insect cell lines. We have tested several commercial insect cell expression systems in Hemiptera insect continuous-culture cells, including the Lepidopteran nucleopolyhedrovirus <italic>immediately early 1</italic> gene promoter (<italic>IE1</italic>)-based vector, a human CMV <italic>immediate early</italic> promoter-based vector, and the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, which are currently considered the most efficient systems for expressing target proteins in various insect cell lines. Unfortunately, none of these vectors works in leafhopper and planthopper cells, due to the high specialization of cultured cells from these species. When two effective promoters of the leafhopper actin gene, the Nl_act3 and Nc_act1 promoters, were evaluated, it was found that only one, the Nc_act1, worked in s2 cells, but both failed to express exogenous genes in cultured leafhopper cells (<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Qian et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). A comparison of the Nc_actin1 promoter (1926 bp) with our <italic>cytoplasmic actin</italic> promoter (2026 bp) showed that their nucleotide sequences are almost identical, except for an extra 100 nucleotides in the 5&#x02032; end of our <italic>cytoplasmic actin</italic> promoter, which we think are necessary for the efficient expression of target protein in leafhopper cell culture lines. Our vector has a wide range of applications, including expression of foreign proteins in leafhopper and even Sf9 cells.</p><p>Several factors affect the level of heterologous protein expression and the transfection efficiency in insect cells. The introduction of the expression vector into cultured insect cells is the first critical step in obtaining efficient expression of exogenous proteins. Liposome-mediated transfection (lipofection), first reported by <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Felgner et&#x000a0;al. (1987</xref>), is one of the most widely used methods and provides improved transfection efficiency in several widely used insect cell culture lines, including <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (Bm5), <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (Sf9), and <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> (IPLB-LdEp, IPLB-LdEIta, IPLB-Ld652Y) cell lines (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Trotter and Wood, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Gundersen-Rindal et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Whitt et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), due to liposomes&#x02019; low immunogenicity, low toxicity, ease of production, and potential for transferring large pieces of DNA into cells. In our study, we examined three different liposome reagents (Cellfectin II, Lip2000, and Lip3000) that have all been reported to produce consistent and efficient transfection in different cultured insect cell lines. Our results indicated that 2 &#x003bc;g plasmid in 4 &#x003bc;l Cellfectin II provided the greatest transfection efficiency, with only minor cell damage, in our cultured leafhopper cells. The enhancer element in the promoter sequence is believed to improve the transcription of the exogenous gene (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). We also found that placing the <italic>Hr5</italic> viral enhancer element upstream from the sequence of our <italic>cytoplasmic actin</italic> promoter resulted in optimized expression of GFP in leafhopper cells, indicating that the <italic>Hr5</italic> enhancer acts on the leafhopper <italic>actin</italic> promoter. Importantly, knocking down the <italic>Dicer2</italic> gene further improved the expression efficiency of the GFP in transfected leafhopper cells, implying that the RNAi pathway also affects the expression efficiency of exogenous genes in this system. Dicer-2&#x000a0;in arthropods contribute to the production of siRNA via cleaving endogenous long dsRNA including transposon transcripts, partially self-complementary hairpin RNAs, and mRNA transcription (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Kandasamy and Fukunaga, 2016</xref>). Several studies showed that the knock-down of Dicer-2 significantly inhibits the efficiency of RNA silencing in insects (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aliyari and Ding, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Lan et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). However, the specific function of Dicer-2&#x000a0;in the expression of exogenous proteins remains unclear, which needs to be investigated.</p><p>Taking advantage of our new <italic>actin</italic> promoter-based transient vector, we first determined the cellular localization of RYSV-encoded proteins in leafhopper cells. RYSV-encoded P6 has been demonstrated to be an RNA silencing suppressor in plant cells, which inhibits the amplification of silencing signals by interfering with the activity of RDR6 (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). The previous investigation suggested that P6 appears to be a structural protein of RYSV (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Our confocal microscopy observations indicated that RYSV-encoded P6 accumulated in the nuclei of vector-transfected leafhopper cells. The morphological characteristics of the P6-formed structures we observed during RYSV infection are identical to those of RYSV viroplasm, which implies that P6 also has a novel function associated with RYSV viroplasm. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay demonstrated that P6 interacts with N and P. Furthermore, the coexpressed P6 and N or P were colocalized in the nuclei of insect vector cells, indicating that P6 may be a component of RYSV viroplasm, which confirms the result of Huang <italic>et al</italic> and suggests that P6 protein like other two structure proteins, N and P, may involve in the establishment of the viroplasm. However, our results did not rule out the previously proposed function of P6 as an insect RNA silencing suppressor.</p><p>The low expression efficiency (around 20% maximum) of our transient expression vector remains an urgent issue to be addressed. More work will be required to optimize the vector for higher expression efficiency. For example, a large double-stranded DNA virus was identified through a small RNA deep-sequencing analysis of leafhopper (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), and we expect that a promoter derived from the genome of this native DNA virus may be suitable for the establishment of a more efficient expression vector. In addition, with the <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> genome sequencing program completed, more efficient native promoters of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> for exogenous protein expression should be evaluated in cultured cell lines. Moreover, other methods of DNA transfection, such as electroporation, should be tested in leafhopper cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sec18"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>X-FZ and YX conducted the experiments.
