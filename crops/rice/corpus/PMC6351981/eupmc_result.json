    "The growing pet food market is continuously in search for novel ingredients. Legumes such as faba beans are increasingly popular in human nutrition but have not yet been explored in pet foods. Extruded dog diets were produced with 0, 10, 20, and 30% dehulled faba bean (DFB) inclusion (FB0, FB10, FB20, and FB30, respectively) in exchange for rice and corn gluten meal. Fixed processing inputs were extruder screw configuration, die size (5.2 mm diameter), dry feed rate (237 kg/h), extruder water and steam (0%), and die knife speed (1100 rpm). Variable inputs were managed by an operator with the goal to obtain similar kibble bulk density at the extruder die (OE) across treatments. Output parameters were measured at the pre-conditioner, extruder, and kibble. Measurements were collected at uniform time increments during production of each experimental diet and considered treatment replicates. Single degree of freedom contrasts were analyzed on extrusion and product outputs. The target of producing diets with similar wet bulk density was achieved, with moderate modifications at the pre-conditioner (PC) and extruder. As DFB increased, diets had increased retention time and water at the PC to improve starch hydration and swelling. The FB20 and FB30 required a more restricted flow to improve kibble expansion. After drying, the FB20 and FB30 diets were denser, harder and tougher (p < 0.05) than FB0 and FB10. The increasing levels of DFB up to 30% can be effectively controlled in an extruded pet food application with modest changes to extrusion parameters."
