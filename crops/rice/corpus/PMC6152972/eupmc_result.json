    "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous regulatory RNA molecules 21-24 nucleotides in length that act as functional regulators of post-transcriptional repression of messenger RNA. We report the identification and characterization of a conserved miRNA and 171 novel miRNAs in the migratory rice pest Sogatella furcifera by deep sequencing, which were observed to be biased towards female adults of the insect, modulating the functionality and targets of the miRNAs in sex differentiation. A switch in arm usage was also observed in 9 miRNA when compared to the insect ancestor during insect evolution. The miRNA loci showed high 5' fidelity in both miRNA and star species and about 93.4% of WBPH miRNAs conserved within non-planthopper species were homologous with planthopper species. The novel miRNAs identified in this study provide a better understanding of the sRNA and the regulatory role of miRNA in sexual dimorphism and alteration in the expression or function of miRNAs in the rice pest."
