    "OBJECTIVES:This study assessed the predatory potentiality of two unexplored fishes, Puntius tetrazona and Hyphessobrycon rosaceus on Culex vishnui subgroup larvae in order to utilize natural resources to diminish mosquito population. Larval feeding rate was evaluated in laboratory under varying prey density and volume of water. The experiment was extended to semi field condition. RESULTS:Puntius tetrazona and H. rosaceus consumed from 66 to 600 and from 87 to 718 Cx. vishnui larvae respectively in laboratory condition at 10 prey density levels (100-1000 larvae) at an increment of 100 larvae at 2Â l water volume. In semi field condition, a 78% reduction in larval density was observed at day 30 post introduction of P. tetrazona, whereas 91% reduction was noted on day 21 for H. rosaceus and in the subsequent samples no mosquito larvae were found in ditches. Withdrawal of predators from the ditches resulted gradual increase in larval density. Laboratory and semi field bioassay of both the species indicated their potentiality as efficient mosquito larval predator though H. rosaceus exhibited better performance than P. tetrazona. It is recommended to utilize these natural resources to diminish mosquito population in the countries of their native range."
