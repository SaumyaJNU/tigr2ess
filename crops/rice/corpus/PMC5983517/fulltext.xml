The brown planthopper (BPH, <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) is a devastating rice insect pest due to its ability to rapidly overcome plant resistance and the lack of sufficient resistance resources. BR4831 (a rice breeding line derived from the pyramiding of two BPH resistance genes, <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic>, into the elite rice variety Huang-Hua-Zhan, HHZ) and two single-gene introgression lines (HF106, carrying <italic>Bph14</italic>, and C602, carrying <italic>Bph15</italic>, in the elite rice cultivar 9311) were evaluated for their resistance to BPH using a standard seed box screening test coupled with field tests. The related resistance types were determined using laboratory assays. The seed box test and laboratory biological assays showed that BR4831 exhibited strong antibiotic resistance, and the behavioral assay showed that this line also exhibited strong antixenotic resistance, while both HF106 and C602 exhibited only weak antibiosis and no antixenotic resistance. Field tests showed significantly improved resistance in BR4831 compared to that of its recipient parent HHZ and slightly increased resistance in HF106 and C602 in comparison with their recipient parent 9311. These results demonstrate that the rice line BR4831, with pyramided resistance genes, exhibits higher resistance than the monogenic lines HF106 and C602 and highlight the benefits of combining the seed box seedling test, field tests and laboratory assays to thoroughly analyze plant resistance types.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)</institution></funding-source><award-id>31601646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Special Funds for Industrial Development of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen City</institution></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20170303154440838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Program of Shenzhen, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>KY20160103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0200809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Deyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) in a grant awarded to YX (Award Number: 31601646); Special Funds for Industrial Development of Dapeng New District, Shenzhen City to YX (Award Number: JCYJ20170303154440838); Science and Technology Program of Shenzhen in a grant to YX (Award Number: KY20160103) and National Key Research and Development Program in a grant to DZ (Award Number: 2016YFD0200809).

The brown planthopper (BPH) (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> St&#x000e5;l), one of the most devastating insect pests [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], is a monophagous vascular feeder that directly damages rice plants by sucking phloem sap from the rice leaf sheath and indirectly damages plants by transmitting plant viruses [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Chemical insecticides are extensively used for the control of BPH, which has resulted in many problems, including toxicity to natural enemies, pest resurgence [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], increased production cost, and long-term agro-ecosystem and human health damage [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Rice resistance is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy for BPH management. To date, 32 BPH resistance genes have been identified in <italic>indica</italic> rice cultivars and related wild species [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, few BPH-resistant rice varieties are widely cultivated [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] due to the ability of BPH to rapidly overcome plant resistance and a lack of sufficient resistance resources. Therefore, identifying new BPH-resistant germplasms and determining the associated resistance types are continuously needed.</p><p>Plant resistance to insect pests is categorized into three types: (1) antibiosis, which reduces herbivore performance following the ingestion of host tissue; (2) tolerance, in which herbivorous infestation is endured; and (3) antixenosis, which repels or disturbs insects, causing a reduction in colonization or oviposition [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Identifying these resistance types can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying resistance.</p><p>Two dominant resistance genes, <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic>, identified in the B5 introgression line, were found to confer strong resistance to BPH [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Bph14</italic> is located on the long arm of chromosome 3, and <italic>Bph15</italic> is located on the short arm of chromosome 4 [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Using a map-based cloning approach, <italic>Bph14</italic> was cloned and was shown to encode a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and to carry a unique LRR domain that might function in both recognizing BPH invasions and activating defense responses [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, <italic>Bph15</italic> was accurately remapped to an approximately 580 kb genomic segment of B5 [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In previous studies, <italic>Bph14</italic>, <italic>Bph15</italic> and other resistance genes have been individually or pyramid-transferred into <italic>indica</italic> rice cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using marker-assisted selection (MAS) to obtain rice lines with improved resistance. These improved rice lines showed higher resistance levels than their corresponding recipient parents. Moreover, the pyramid effect of multiple genes has been detected in BPH resistance. These results provide valuable information for the proper utilization of BPH resistance genes.</p><p>In the last decade, several elite rice varieties have been bred and commercially planted in China. One such variety is 9311, which is widely planted throughout China. Hybrids from the 9311 parent have accounted for most of the rice cultivation in China in the past 10 years [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Huang-Hua-Zhan (HHZ) is another widely planted <italic>indica</italic> rice variety in southern China that has a high yield and shows good quality [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, these varieties are susceptible to BPH due to the absence of BPH resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a recent endeavor to breed new rice lines with B5 as the donor parent and HHZ and 9311 as the recipient parents, homozygous stable lines were selected from the BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>4</sub> generation in combination with MAS. Although these stable rice lines are expected to show BPH resistance, this has yet to be demonstrated. For the potential incorporation of these lines in further rice breeding, the levels of BPH resistance in the rice lines HF106, C602 and BR4831 and their parents (B5, 9311 and HHZ) were evaluated in both semifield and field conditions. The resistance types of these lines were assessed in the laboratory using a series of biological and behavioral assays. The present study is of significance for future BPH resistance evaluations and for the further breeding of rice varieties to achieve high resistance to BPH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>BPH population and rice germplasms</title><p>BPH originated from samples collected from paddy fields at the Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Crop Pests in Guilin, Ministry of Agriculture, China (25&#x000b0;36&#x02032;00&#x02033;N and 110&#x000b0;41&#x02032;24&#x02033;E).

This test method is widely used in rice breeding programs and has been described in detail in several publications [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The seed box test is a choice test by which rice germplasms can be ranked according to damage caused by planthopper nymphs.</p><p>Twenty germinated seeds of each germplasm were evenly seeded at a 0.5 cm depth within a row in a seed box (L &#x000d7; W &#x000d7; H, 75 &#x000d7; 45 &#x000d7; 15 cm), which was filled with paddy soil to a depth of 3&#x02013;4 cm, and were then covered with a thin layer of fine dry soil, which was subsequently wetted. The seeding rows in the box were 5 cm apart and were arranged in a randomized design with respect to the different germplasms in a box. At the edges of the box, TN1 seeds were sown in two rows to provide protection. After seeding, the box was placed in an 80-mesh insect-proof cage (L &#x000d7; W &#x000d7; H, 95 &#x000d7; 95 &#x000d7; 95 cm). The emerged seedlings were allowed to develop for 7 days and then thinned to 18 plants per row, and any weeds in the box were removed.</p><p>To obtain BPH nymphs for the test, potted TN1 tillering plants were exposed to 200 gravid females for oviposition in a cage. The potted plants were replaced every 24 h, and the replaced seedlings were transferred to different cages according to the exposure date. The newly hatched nymphs were allowed to develop to the second/third instar when used for the test.</p><p>At the seedling two-leaf stage in the seed boxes, potted plants with second-/third-instar BPH nymphs were gently transported to the boxes and patted to drop the nymphs onto the seedlings. During the process of slowly moving the potted plants over the boxes, the dropped nymphs were visually estimated to drop approximately 8&#x02013;10 nymphs onto each seedling. Thereafter, the boxes were returned the cages individually.</p><p>When the TN1 seedlings in a box had become completely wilted due to planthopper feeding, the tests were terminated, and the damage to all seedlings in a box was scored according to Horgan et al.

A potted rice plant (30&#x02013;45 DAT) was run through a glass tube inserted (1 cm) into the potting soil. A cut-out sponge slice (4 cm in diameter, 2 cm in height) encircling the rice stem was fit to the lower end of the tube to secure the rice plant and prevent drowning of the test insects. After 5 first-instar nymphs (&#x0003c; 24 h) were transferred to the plant in a glass tube, the top opening of the tube was sealed with a sponge slice to prevent insect escape. Three tubes were installed in the same manner per pot, and 48 tubes were prepared for each germplasm. The insects in the glass tubes were observed daily to record the developmental stage and number of nymphs surviving until adult emergence. The emerged adults were sucked out and sorted daily according to sex. The adult weight was obtained (Q/OAFA electronic balance, Mettler Toledo Instrument CO., LTD, Shanghai, China) individually for 30 randomly selected newly emerged adult females and males (&#x0003c; 24 h). The developmental duration was calculated for the nymphs. Forty-eight tubes per rice germplasm were randomly divided into 3 replicates to calculate nymphal survival rates (number of emerged adults/number of first-instar nymphs) and adult sex ratios (number of female adults/number of male adults).</p><p>The performance of adults originating from the above tests were further compared using the test arena described above. One macropterous BPH female and three males (&#x0003c; 24 h) resulting from the above tests were transferred to a plant (30&#x02013;45 DAT) originating in the glass tube in the climate-controlled room. One female served as a replicate, and 15 females were tested for each rice germplasm. The adults were observed daily for survival until death. Adult longevity was obtained from the emergence date and death date. Beginning on the third day from the beginning of the test, nymphs on the stem, if any, were counted and removed daily until no nymphs were observed for 4 continuous days. Then, the rice stem between the two sponge slices was dissected under a microscope to assess the number of unhatched BPH eggs. The fecundity (sum of the number of nymphs and the number of unhatched eggs) and egg hatching rate (number of nymphs divided by fecundity) of each female were calculated.</p><p>The developmental duration of eggs was assessed to calculate laboratory population parameters. The procedures were largely the same as those utilized to assess adult BPH performance, except three macropterous gravid BPH females were confined to one plant of each rice germplasm within a tube and then removed after 24 h. The egg developmental duration was calculated as the difference between the oviposition date and the hatching date obtained from daily observation.</p><p>The BPH population parameters were calculated using an SAS program [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with the data obtained above, which included the intrinsic rate of natural increase (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>), finite capacity of increase (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>), net reproductive rate (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>), and mean generation time (<italic>T</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Amount of feeding by adult BPH females</title><p>BPH honeydew excretion is an indicator of the amount of feeding [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

One macropterous BPH female, starved for 3 h, was transferred onto a Parafilm sachet (3.5 &#x000d7; 3.5 cm) attached to the stem of a potted rice plant (30&#x02013;45 DAT) 5 cm above the soil surface in a climate-controlled room. The female was allowed to feed ad libitum for 72 h and then carefully removed from the sachet using an aspirator. The weight difference between the sachet before and after the test equaled the amount of excreted honeydew. Thirty BPH female adults were tested for each rice germplasm.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Settling preference of adult BPH females</title><p>The preferences of adult BPH females for the rice germplasms were tested in cages. One potted rice plant (30&#x02013;45 DAT) of each rice germplasm was arranged evenly in a circle in a cylindrical mesh cage (90 cm diameter). Eighty macropterous BPH females (1&#x02013;3 days old, starved for 3 h) in a plastic cup (5 cm diameter, 6 cm height) were placed in the center of the circular cage and allowed to freely select the plants. The number of insects on each plant was checked at 24, 72 and 120 h after the insects were introduced into the cage. The observations were repeated 10 times, and the relative positions of the potted plants were rotated between repetitions. The settling rates of the insects on the plants of different germplasms were calculated as the number of insects settled on a plant divided by the total number of insects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc, New York, USA).

The migratory trait of BPHs makes precise control decisions difficult, resulting in frequent control spraying, even within a single rice season; therefore, incorporating crop resistance into the management of migratory BPHs is even more important than that for other insect pests. In an extensive evaluation of BPH resistance, Horgan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found that only a few available resistance genes are effective in monogenic rice lines. Hence, thorough evaluation of rice resistance in the existing germplasms is critical for the identification and utilization of resistance genes against BPH [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Screening of rice plant resistance to planthoppers has been performed using a variety of methods, including field tests, mass screening in seed boxes, and modified seed box tests [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present investigation, we evaluated resistance levels in rice germplasms using a combination of these methods. The results of our seed box test indicated that the sibling rice line BR4831, from the B5 and HHZ parents, was resistant to BPH, and the sibling rice line C602, from the B5 and 9311 parents, was moderately susceptible or moderately resistant to BPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Although the seed box test is a rapid and simple method to evaluate seedling susceptibility to planthoppers [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], this test assesses the responses of nymphs only under substantially simplified conditions. Our field tests confirmed the resistance level of BR4831 determined in the seed box tests, where the BPH population in the BR4831 plots was smaller than in the TN1 plots (the susceptible control) and did not differ from that in the IR64 plots (the resistant control) at 4 of the 5 monitoring times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0198630.t002">Table 2</xref>). However, the field tests indicated that C602 was susceptible to BPH because the population size in the C602 plots did not differ from that in the TN1 plots at all 5 monitoring times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0198630.t002">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, a field test over an entire season in combination with the seed box test is more appropriate for evaluating resistance levels in an array of plant germplasms.</p><p>Plant resistance to herbivores is classified as antibiosis, antixenosis or tolerance, and laboratory assays are necessary to differentiate the resistance types. In a no-choice design, we observed a significantly prolonged developmental duration and reduced survival of BPH nymphs on BR4831 plants than on TN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g002">Fig 2</xref>), indicating that the rice line BR4831 is antibiotic to BPH nymphs. Furthermore, we recorded reduced fecundity, egg hatching rates, female ratios, female weights and longevity on BR4831 plants compared with TN1 plants and, to a lesser extent, on C602 and HF106 plants compared with TN1 plants (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g004">4</xref>). Similar antibiotic effects on BPH performance in introgressed rice lines were found when MH63 was used as the recipient parent [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These laboratory population parameters resulted in significantly lower net reproductive rates (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) in the BR4831, C602 and HF106 populations (ranked from low to high) compared with the TN1 population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0198630.t003">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, BR4831 exhibits obvious antibiotic resistance, while C602 and HF106 exhibit weak antibiotic resistance to BPH. The antibiotic resistance level in these rice germplasms was positively associated with the amount of BPH feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which has been reported frequently [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These laboratory test results explain the resistance levels of the rice germplasms recorded in the seed box test limited to the detection of antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A behavioral preference test under choice conditions is usually employed for the detection of antixenotic resistance in crop lines. BR4831 shows antixenotic resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g006">Fig 6</xref>), as indicated by the consistently lower settling rates of BPHs on BR4831 plants compared with TN1 plants at all 3 monitoring times and compared with HHZ plants at 2 of the 3 monitoring times. Furthermore, the antixenosis observed in BR4831 was as strong as that in both B5 and IR64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198630.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These results confirm the field test results showing that no differences in BPH population size existed between the BR4831 plots and either the IR64 or B5 plots. The rice lines C602 and HF106 showed no antixenosis against BPH compared with TN1 and their parent 9311. This observation may explain the equal population sizes in the field plots of these two rice lines and the TN1 and 9311 varieties, although C602 and HF106 showed enhanced or marginally increased antibiosis in the seed box test and laboratory assays compared with TN1 and 9311. In introgression rice lines harboring <italic>Bph14</italic> or <italic>Bph15</italic> with MH63 as the recipient parent, antixenosis to BPH is observed [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The difference in antixenosis observed in these sibling germplasms may be due to the different genetic backgrounds of the recipient parents.</p><p>We recorded obviously increased antibiotic and antixenotic resistance in BR4831 relative to its recipient parent HHZ and enhanced or marginally increased antibiosis in C602 and HF106 relative to their recipient parent 9311. BR4831 is a dual-gene (<italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic>) homozygous stable line, while C602 and HF106 are single-gene (<italic>Bph14</italic> or <italic>Bph15</italic>) homozygous lines, and BR4831 showed higher resistance to BPH than HF106 and C602 in both the seed box and field tests. Employing seed box tests, several previous studies involving the <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198630.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as well other genes [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198630.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have demonstrated similar results regarding pyramided rice lines showing stronger resistance than single-gene lines. The antibiosis recorded herein with the two single-gene introgression lines C602 and HF106 was not as strong as that reported by Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where 92.3% of <italic>Bph14</italic> single-introgression lines exhibited moderate resistance, and all of the <italic>Bph15</italic> single-introgression lines showed resistance or high resistance in the seed box test. In another report involving the <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic> genes introgressed into the recipient parent MH63, BPH resistance in the single-gene rice lines was improved compared with that in the recipient MH63 [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The genetic backgrounds of recipient parents can complicate the final resistance levels observed in introgressed lines. In the present study, B5 carried the resistance genes <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic>, while 9311 and HHZ did not carry these genes [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0198630.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and HF106 and C602, sibling lines of B5 and 9311, were confirmed to carry <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic>, respectively. However, HF106 and C602 showed only marginal or no differences from HHZ and 9311 in terms of the measured parameters. Similar low resistance in some lines singly introgressed with <italic>Bph14</italic> has also been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It may be that the resistance genes <italic>Bph14</italic> and <italic>Bph15</italic> are either not expressed or are not fully expressed in HF106 and C602, as indicated in a previous study showing that BPH resistance genes with a partial dominant effect result in moderate resistance or the maintenance of susceptibility to BPH in different genetic backgrounds [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the number of backcrosses involved in obtaining such introgressed lines can also affect the genetic background derived from the resistant parent. The rice lines used in this study resulted from three backcrosses and four selfings. BPH biotypes can also influence the detected resistance levels in introgressed lines. There are four BPH biotypes, and different biotypes show variable adaptations to assorted resistance genes [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The BPH population that we used in our tests may have overcome the single resistance gene present in HF106 and C602.</p><p>Overall, we observed increased BPH resistance in the introgressed rice line BR4831 using a combination of seedling (seed box) and field tests. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance was elucidated using laboratory assays, and antixenotic resistance was revealed using BPH settling behavior tests. Most studies employ the seedling test only for resistance evaluation of improved rice lines, which may lead to incomplete conclusions. Our results indicate that the dual-gene introgression rice line BR4831 is resistant to BPH via antibiosis and antixenosis, while the two single-gene lines HF106 and C602 show only weak antibiosis and no antixenotic resistance. These results confirm the hypothesis of Horgan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0198630.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that the pyramiding of two or more genes with strong to weak resistance could improve the strength and durability of resistance. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of incorporating seedling tests, field tests and laboratory assays in the evaluation of planthopper resistance in rice germplasms, or even in other insect pest-crop systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Xuehai Ren, Feng Ling, Ting Gao, and Haowen Dong for their technical assistance with the experiments and Maolin Hou for critical comments on a draft version of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0198630.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bottrell</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schoenly</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name>. <article-title>Resurrecting the ghost of green revolutions past: the brown planthopper as a recurring threat to high-yielding rice production in tropical Asia</article-title>. <source>J Asia-Pac Entomol</source>. <year>2012</year>; <volume>15</volume>: <fpage>122</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>140</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0198630.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>XY</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>He</surname><given-names>GC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Towards understanding of molecular interactions between rice and the brown planthopper</article-title>. <source>Mol Plant</source>. <year>2013</year>; <volume>6</volume>: <fpage>621</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>634</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst030">10.1093/mp/sst030</ext-link></comment>
