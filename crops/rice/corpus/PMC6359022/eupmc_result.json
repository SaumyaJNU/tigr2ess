    "The concentrations of trace elements in wines and health risk assessment via wine consumption were investigated in 315 wines. Samples were collected from eight major wine-producing regions in China. The concentrations of twelve trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Duncan's multiple range test was applied to analyze significant variations (p < 0.05) of trace elements in different regions. Based on a 60 kg adult drinker consuming 200 mL of wine per day, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of each element from wines was far below the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI). Health risk assessment indicated the ingestion influence of individual elements and combined elements through this Chinese wine daily intake did not constitute a health hazard to people. However, Cr and Mn were the potential contaminants of higher health risk in Chinese wines. The cumulative impact of wine consumption on trace elements intake in the daily diet of drinkers should not be ignored due to the presence of other intake pathways."
