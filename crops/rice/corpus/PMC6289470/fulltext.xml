Studies have demonstrated the roles of phytohormones, particularly auxin and brassinosteroids, and various factors in controlling leaf inclination. However, the underlying mechanism especially the upstream regulatory networks still need being clarified. Here we report the functional characterization of rice leaf inclination3 (LC3), a SPOC domain-containing transcription suppressor, in regulating leaf inclination through interacting with LIP1 (LC3-interacting protein 1), a HIT zinc finger domain-containing protein. LC3 deficiency results in increased leaf inclination and enhanced expressions of <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. Being consistent, transgenic plants with <italic>OsIAA12</italic> overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination. LIP1 directly binds to promoter regions of <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>, and interacts with LC3 to synergistically suppress auxin signaling. Our study demonstrate the distinct effects of IAA12-ARF17 interactions in leaf inclination regulation, and provide informative clues to elucidate the functional mechanism of SPOC domain-containing transcription suppressor and fine-controlled network of lamina joint development by LC3-regulated auxin homeostasis and auxin signaling through.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Leaf angle is a major trait of ideal architecture of crops that associates with photosynthetic efficiency and yields. Studies of the underlying mechanism will greatly help to improve the crop yield. Phytohormones especially auxin and brassinosteroids play crucial roles in regulating the leaf inclination, however, the upstream regulatory network is still unknown. Here, we functionally characterize a novel SPOC domain-containing protein LC3 (leaf inclination3) in lamina joint development through regulating auxin signaling. LC3 deficiency results in the excessive cell elongation at lamina joint adaxial side and hence the enlarged leaf angle. LC3 acts as a transcription suppressor through interacting with LIP1 (LC3-interacting protein 1, a HIT zinc finger domain-containing transcription factor), which directly binds to the promoters of auxin signaling and homeostasis related genes. Our studies provide new insights in the functional mechanism of SPOC domain-containing proteins and help to elucidate how auxin signaling is regulated during lamina joint development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91535201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7641-5320</contrib-id><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Hong-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Ten-Thousand Talent Program</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7641-5320</contrib-id><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Hong-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>State Key Laboratory of Wheat and Maize Crop Science</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Southern Regional Collaborative Innovation Center for Grain and Oil Crops in China</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (91535201, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>), &#x0201c;Ten-Thousand Talent Program&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rencai.people.com.cn/GB/244856/355107/index.html">http://rencai.people.com.cn/GB/244856/355107/index.html</ext-link>), State Key Laboratory of Wheat and Maize Crop Science, and Southern Regional Collaborative Innovation Center for Grain and Oil Crops in China.

Leaf is the main organ for photosynthesis and its development is crucial for the yield potential. Leaf inclination indicates the angle between leaf blade and culm [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and studies have shown that erect leaf facilitates the penetration of sunlight and enhances the photosynthetic efficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which is suitable for dense planting. Unbalanced development of collar cells at adaxial or abaxial sides, development of mechanical tissue and mechanical strength, formation of vascular bundle and cell wall compositions also have been pointed out to affect the leaf angle [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recent systemic analysis of the dynamic developmental processes of lamina joint through cytological observation showed that cell differentiation, division and elongation, cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death (PCD), are closely correlated with leaf angle and regulated by a complex network, consisting of various factors, especially protein kinases and hormones [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

LIP1 directly binds to <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> promoters. OsIAA12 interacts with OsARF17 to suppress the auxin signaling. Through suppressing the expressions of <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>, LC3-LIP1 module promotes auxin signaling and hence suppresses the cell elongation at adaxial side of lamina joint, to maintain the normal leaf inclination. Deficiency of LC3 results in the increased expression of <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> and hence reduced auxin level and signaling, leading to the enlarged cell width at adaxial side of lamina joint and increased leaf inclination.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1007829.g006"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Discussion</title><p>SPOC-domain is speculated to facilitate protein-protein interactions in the transcription repression complex. Although SPOC domain-containing proteins are demonstrated to involve in regulation of various developmental processes, functions of them in plants are rarely reported. On the other hand, though auxin signaling/biosynthesis related genes are shown to affect the lamina joint development, the upstream regulation is still poorly understood. We functionally characterize a novel rice SPOC domain-containing protein leaf inclination 3 (LC3), whose deficiency (<italic>lc3</italic> mutant) presents enhanced leaf angle due to the excessive cell elongation at adaxial side of lamina joint, and demonstrate that LC3 controls leaf inclination by regulating auxin signaling through interacting with LIP1, a HIT zinc finger domain-containing transcriptional factor. It is therefore proposed that LC3 interacts with LIP1 to cooperatively suppress the expression levels of <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>, resulting in the suppressed auxin signaling and homeostasis, to maintain the normal lamina joint development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007829.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Our findings not only identify a novel factor regulating leaf inclination through auxin signaling and homoeostasis, but also reveal the function and underlying mechanism of a novel SPOC domain-containing protein.</p><p>Previous reports showed that RRM domain of SPOC domain-containing protein functions to recognize and bind to DNA/RNAs. Deficiency of RRM domain suggests that LC3 acts as a transcription repressor through interacting with other factors. Indeed, LIP1, a HIT zinc finger domain-containing TF, recognizes specific DNA sequence and forms a heterodimer with LC3 through interaction to suppress the transcription of downstream genes, especially <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. These illustrate the mechanism how LC3-LIP1 heterodimer represses the expression of auxin signaling and homeostasis related genes. In addition, it&#x02019;s the first time to characterize the function and relevant mechanism of a SPOC-domain containing protein lacking RRM domain, which expands the knowledge on regulating the expression of downstream target genes in addition to RRM domain. A mouse Spen-like protein, MINT, binds to homeoprotein Msx2 to co-regulate osteocalcin [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and our results provide another example showing how SPOC-domain containing protein functions through interacting with a HIT zinc finger domain-containing protein, suggesting that SPOC-domain containing protein may interact with distinct TFs to suppress the transcription of specific genes, which provides novel insights for the functions of SPOC-domain containing proteins.</p><p>The underlying mechanism how LC3-LIP1 represses downstream target genes expression and whether there are other factors involving in the regulation, still need further investigations. In human, SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein), a spen protein, interacts with co-repressor SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) and NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and these co-repressors repress transcription by recruiting a large complex containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In mice, Znhit1 binds to HDAC1 and suppresses <italic>CDK6</italic> expression by decreasing the histone H4 acetylation level in its promoter region [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Whether LC3 interacts with histone deacetylase or any other factors to repress the downstream gene transcription and hence regulates the distinct developmental processes needs further studies.</p><p>Plant phytohormone IAA plays crucial roles in lamina joint development, however, the upstream regulations of the key negative regulator Aux/IAAs during the process and which distinct IAA-ARF interaction is involved in lamina joint development control are unclear. We at first time demonstrate that a SPOC domain-containing protein LC3 regulates auxin signaling by directly suppress <italic>OsIAA12</italic> and auxin homeostasis through <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic>. Aux/IAAs bind to ARFs to suppress its function [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and as a multi-member family (there are 25 ARFs and 31 Aux/IAA proteins in rice), studies have revealed a complex interacting network of Aux/IAAs-ARFs that participate in regulation of various aspects of plant growth and development. Although it is known that each IAA protein can interact with different ARFs and each ARF protein can be suppressed by different IAAs to perform the diverse and specific functions [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], distinct functions of each interaction pair and how IAA-ARF interaction regulates leaf inclination remain to be elucidated. Our studies demonstrate the specific role of OsIAA12-OsARF17 interaction, which will help to illustrate the auxin effects in lamina joint development. Interestingly, other Aux/IAAs proteins (i.e. OsIAA20, OsIAA21, and OsIAA31) interact with OsARF17 besides OsIAA12, and OsIAA12 can also bind with OsARF21 [<xref rid="pgen.1007829.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whether other Aux/IAAs-ARFs interactions regulate leaf inclination need further investigation. Further studies of the downstream genes of OsARF17 will expand the understanding of the detailed mechanism of OsIAA12-OsARF17 regulation in lamina joint development.
