Here, a new mechanism for Cd<sup>2+</sup> entry into rice root cells was investigated. The results showed that Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx in rice roots exhibited spatially and temporally dynamic patterns. There was a clear longitudinal variation in Cd uptake along rice roots, with the root tip showing much higher Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and concentration than the root mature zone, which might be due to the much higher expression of the well-known Cd transporter genes <italic>OsIRT1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP5</italic>, and <italic>OsZIP1</italic> in the root tip. Both the net Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and the uptake of Cd in rice roots were highly inhibited by ion channel blockers Gd<sup>3+</sup> and TEA<sup>+</sup>, supplementation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, and the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitor vanadate, with Gd<sup>3+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> showing the most inhibitory effects. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or Gd<sup>3+</sup>-induced reduction in Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and Cd uptake did not coincide with the expression of Cd transporter genes, but with that of two Ca channel genes, <italic>OsAAN4</italic> and <italic>OsGLR3.4</italic>. These results indicate that Cd transporters are in part responsible for Cd<sup>2+</sup> entry into rice root, and provide a new perspective that the Ca channels OsAAN4 and OsGLR3.4 might play an important role in rice root Cd uptake.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Calcium-permeable channels</kwd><kwd>Cd influx</kwd><kwd>Cd uptake</kwd><kwd>longitudinal variation</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31371559</award-id><award-id>31571599</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Public Benefit Technology Applied Research Project of Zhejiang Province, China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2014C32035</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science Innovation Project</named-content></funding-source><award-id>CAAS-ASTIP-2013-CNRRI</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As a result of atmospheric deposition, wastewater irrigation, use of metal-containing fertilizers and pesticides, and many other industrial processes, cadmium (Cd) has become one of the most toxic and widespread environmental pollutants in agricultural soil (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Rizwan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Being a non-essential element for plants, excess Cd in soils interferes with plant growth and development, reduces crop yield, and accumulates to a high level in plant tissues, thus posing a threat to human and animal health through the food chain (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). To ensure food safety, breeding &#x02018;low-Cd&#x02019; crops has become one of the most important strategies to reduce Cd in crops, for which a fundamental understanding of the Cd uptake mechanism in plant roots would be a critical issue.</p><p>Although great progress has been achieved over the last decades, the complex pathways of Cd entry into root cells are still not fully understood. Since Cd is a non-essential element for plants and interferes with the uptake of other ions, it was assumed that Cd could be absorbed into cells by the transporters for essential elements such as Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, due to the lack of specificity of these transporters (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Clemens 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It has been well documented that Cd could enter into root cells through various NRAMP (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family members, such as OsNRAMP1, OsNRAMP5, and AtNRAMP6; ZIP (zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein) transporters, such as AtIRT1 and TcZNT1/TcZIP4; the low affinity calcium transporters such as TaLCT1; or through YSL (Yellow-Stripe 1-Like) proteins such as ZmYSL1 as Cd chelates (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Schaaf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Cailliatte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, and references therein; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>;). Of all the transporters above, OsNRAMP5, which is a major contributor to constitutive Mn<sup>2+</sup> uptake, was considered to be a major route of Cd uptake from the external environment and entry into cells in rice (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ishimaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, a recent study by <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> revealed that the knock-down of OsNRAMP5 triggered only ~20% reduction in root Cd content but a significant increase in shoot Cd content in both hydroponic and field trials. These results indicated that there might be other pathways for Cd entry into root cells, apart from the poor selectivity of transition ion transporters. Indeed, some studies suggested that Cd could also possibly be taken up via cation channels, such as K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which are relatively non-selective between cations (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">White and Broadley, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; L.Z. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, the contribution of this pathway to root Cd uptake remains to be further verified. Therefore, more effort is still needed to elucidate thoroughly the mechanism by which Cd is taken up into plant roots and cells.</p><p> With the innovation of non-invasive microelectrode measurements such as the microelectrode ion flux estimation (MIFE) technique (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Newman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Shabala, 2006</xref>) and Cd-selective microelectrodes (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Pi&#x000f1;eros <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>), Cd<sup>2+</sup> fluxes have been characterized in various Cd-hyperaccumulating plants (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, L.Z. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the kinetics of Cd<sup>2+</sup> &#x0fb02;ux across root cells in the rice plant, which is considered to be a model among monocots for biological research. Furthermore, as rice is a staple food crop for half of the world&#x02019;s population, Cd in rice grain has become a major source of dietary Cd intake for this part of the world (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the characteristics of the transmembrane Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport and Cd uptake in different root zones were investigated in this study in the absence and presence of a series of treatments by measuring Cd<sup>2+</sup> flux, Cd concentration, Cd fluorescence localization, and gene expression. The aim of this study was (i) to reveal the longitudinal variation in Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and Cd distribution along rice root and explain how such variation is generated; and (ii) to elucidate whether Cd<sup>2+</sup> enters into rice root cells through ion channels permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> and explore the candidate transporter genes involved in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials, growth conditions, and treatments</title><p>Rice cultivar IR8, which accumulates high amounts of Cd (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), was used in the present study.

First, it may result from the alteration of root anatomy; that is, the development of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in the endodermis and exodermis and cell lignification (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Schreiber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">White, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Laporte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It has been documented that the presence of Cd produced Casparian bands, suberin lamellae, and lignification, which could restrict the apoplastic diffusion of Cd in root cells and consequently the whole-plant Cd accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Enstone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Redjala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Laporte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). In the present study, however, no significant difference in the development of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae and cell lignification was observed between the root tip (0&#x02013;2 mm from root cap) and the MZ (10&#x02013;15 mm from root cap) after 3 d of 20 &#x000b5;M CdCl<sub>2</sub> (data not shown), indicating an inability of the apoplastic barrier to explain the occurrence of longitudinal variation in Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx in this study. Another plausible reason for the longitudinal variation in Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx may be attributed to the higher Cd transport activity of the root tip than the MZ, which could be reflected by the expression level of transporters for Cd. As expected, much higher expression of four well-known Cd transport genes, namely <italic>OsIRT1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP5</italic>, and <italic>OsZIP1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Uraguchi and Fujiwara, 2012</xref>), was observed in the root tip than in the MZ, both prior to and after onset of Cd treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). These findings suggest that the cells of the meristem and EZs have stronger absorbing capacity for Cd uptake than the mature root cells, which might be attributed to the greater energy in that part of roots (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Cd can enter into rice root cells via the pathways for Ca and K</title><p>A fundamental understanding of how Cd is taken up by rice roots would be a critical issue for revealing the mechanisms of Cd accumulation in rice grains. However, the non-essentiality and toxicity of Cd to plants make its entry into root cells a deep mystery. With years of effort, many transporters for essential elements, such as OsNRAMPs, OsZIPs, and OsIRTs, have been demonstrated to have an influx activity of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in rice roots (reviewed by <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Uraguchi and Fujiwara, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

However, our MIFE and ICP-MS measurements revealed that the Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and uptake were significantly inhibited by the pharmacological treatments mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3 F4 F5">Figs 3&#x02013;5</xref>), suggesting that these transporters only contribute in part to root Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and uptake, at least in the case where the external Cd concentration is as high as 20 &#x000b5;M in the present study (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Lee and An, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Therefore, it can be assumed that there might be other pathways for Cd entry into rice root cells.</p><p> It is well known that there is a competition between Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, because of their similarities in charge and ionic radius (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; L.Z. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; S. <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).

The previous studies on Cd hyperaccumulators have also suggested that Cd could possibly enter the PM of root cells via Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; L.Z. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). To obtain an insight into the role of the Ca pathway in rice root Cd uptake, the present study investigated the competitive interactions of Cd and Ca with different techniques. The results of pharmacological measurements clearly showed that the elevation of the Ca level (from 0.1 mM to 5 mM) in the medium significantly inhibited root Cd uptake, in terms of both transient Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and long-term total Cd uptake in rice roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results suggested that Cd entry into rice roots was probably through Ca channels or transporters. Actually, several kinds of calcium-permeable channels, such as depolarization-activated calcium channels (DACCs), hyperpolarization-activated calcium channels (HACCs), and voltage-insensitive cation channels (VICCs), were reported to mediate Cd transport in plant roots (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, and references therein). All of these channels are relatively non-selective between cations, and can be blocked by the NSCCs blocker Gd<sup>3+</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, and references therein). Indeed, the transient net Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx of rice root in this study was completely blocked by Gd<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the total Cd concentration in rice root was reduced by 58.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), implying that these non-selective channels may mediate Cd<sup>2+</sup> transmembrane transport as it does for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (S. <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Potassium is the most abundant element in the plant cytosol and plays a vital role in nullifying the adverse impacts of stress on plants (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak, 2005</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> reported that K supplementation could minimize the uptake of Cd. In the present study, the elevation of the K level (from 0.5 mM to 10 mM) in the medium was also observed to reduce the transient Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and long-term total Cd uptake in rice roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results indicated that the uptake of Cd into the cytosol of rice roots proceeds through channels permeable to K<sup>+</sup>. This was confirmed by the &#x0003e;95% reduction in the net Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and 31.1% reduction in total Cd concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) of rice roots pre-treated with 20 mM TEA<sup>+</sup>, which is a well-known blocker of K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Maathuis and Sanders, 1996</xref>). A similar result was also found in the pharmacological measurements with fluorescent imaging in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and in previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lindberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, no K channel or transporter has been found in plants yet to have the capacity to transport Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and the transcript levels of two well-known genes for transporting K to the cytosol (i.e. <italic>OsAKT1</italic> and <italic>OsHAK5</italic>) were not significantly induced by Cd treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). However, one prokaryotic potassium channel isolated from <italic>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</italic> named MthK, which contains a region called the regulator of the conductance of K<sup>+</sup> (RCK) domain, has been found to bind divalent cations, such as Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Dvir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). It is also activated by Cd<sup>2+</sup> more effectively than by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). So, it could be hypothesized that some K channels, which have structural homology to the RCK domain of MthK, might have an ability to binding to Cd<sup>2+</sup> similar to that of MthK. Indeed, several channels from higher plants, such as CASTOR and POLLUX in <italic>Lotus japonicas</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Charpentier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), DMI1 (DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS1) in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">An&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and SYM8 in <italic>Pisum sativum</italic>, have already been reported to share a short stretch of predicted structural homology with the pore region of MthK (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). All these channels are identified to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and have the biological function of ion transmembrane transport.

These results suggest that Cd exhibits high affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites over K<sup>+</sup>-binding sites during transport across the PM.

Therefore, it would be expected that Cd may enter root cells via hyperpolarized ion channels, for example the HACCs, such as <italic>OsANN4</italic> in the present study, like those described in previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Perfus-Barbeoch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Lux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; L.Z. <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, Cd uptake exhibited a clear longitudinal variation along rice roots, with the root tip (including the meristem and EZs) showing much higher Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx and Cd concentration than the MZ, which might be attributed to the much higher gene expression of <italic>OsIRT1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP1</italic>, <italic>OsNRAMP5</italic>, and <italic>OsZIP1</italic> in comparison with the MZ. The Cd<sup>2+</sup> uptake by rice root cells was restricted by the blockage of ion channels and the elevated external levels of K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, regardless of Cd exposure time, suggesting an important role for ion channels permeable to cations such as K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in transmembrane Cd transport. The Cd transporters OsIRT1, OsNRAMP1, OsNRAMP5, and OsZIP1 are in part responsible for the Cd<sup>2+</sup> entry into rice root, and the Ca channels OsAAN4 and OsGLR3.4 might play an important role in rice root Cd uptake. However, the permeability and selectivity of these channels to Cd<sup>2+</sup> and their value in &#x02018;low-Cd&#x02019; rice innovation need to be further elucidated using electrophysiological and molecular techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s27"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1.
