In the era of climate change and multiple abiotic stresses, it becomes important to analyze stability of rice lines under both irrigated and stress conditions. Mutants are an important genetic resource which can help in revealing the basis of natural variation. We analyzed 300 EMS induced mutants of <italic>aus</italic> rice cultivar Nagina22 (N22) for their G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E interaction and stability under low phosphorus (P), water limited and irrigated conditions. Environmental effect and interaction were more significant than genotypic contribution on grain yield (GY), productive tillers (TN) and plant height (PH) under these three environmental conditions in dry season, 2010. GY and TN were more affected by low P stress than by water limited condition, but PH was not significantly different under these two stresses. Mutants G17, G209, G29, G91, G63 and G32 were stable for GY in decreasing order of stability across the three environments but G254 and G50 were stable only in low P, G17 and G45 only in water limited and G295 and G289 only in normal irrigated condition. We then selected and evaluated 3 high yielding mutants, 3 low yielding mutants and N22 for their stability and adaptability to these 3 environments in both wet and dry seasons for six years (2010&#x02013;2015). The most stable lines based on the combined analysis of 12 seasons were G125 (NH210) under normal condition, G17 (NH686), G176 (NH363) and G284 (NH162) in low P condition and G176 (NH363) under water limited condition. G176 was the best considering all 3 conditions. When screened for 15 <italic>Pup1</italic> gene-specific markers, G176 showed alleles similar to N22. While two other low-P tolerant lines G17 and G65 showed N22 similar alleles only at k-1 and k-5 but a different allele or null allele at 13 other loci. These stable mutants are a valuable resource for varietal development and to discover genes for tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice farming is the backbone of agriculture in Asia as over 90% of the world&#x02019;s rice is produced and consumed in this region. There is a disparity between the rate of rice production and the rate of increase in rice consuming population, leading to more emphasis on improving rice productivity. Breeding rice varieties with tolerance to abiotic stresses is an economically viable and sustainable option to improve rice productivity. Hence there is a necessity to tackle the abiotic stresses which together restrict the ability of rice to realize its complete yield potential. However, improving stress tolerance in crops through conventional breeding is limited due to the complex underlying mechanisms and also high environmental influence. Additionally the phenomenon of climate change is likely to widen the area affected by abiotic stresses. Different abiotic stresses often occur together or one after another in the same crop season. Some of the common abiotic stresses that limit rice crop growth and productivity are drought, salinity, nutrient deficiency and high temperature. Of these, drought and phosphorus deficiency have become major concerns which affect rice production, especially in water limited cultivation systems. Increasing genetic diversity through mutants can generate desirable variability required to cope with abiotic stresses in the coming decades. It is also crucial for the sustainable management of water and fertilizer for agricultural production.</p><p id="Par3">Water is one of the most important components for sustainable rice production and its deficit is a concern in both irrigated and rainfed areas where rice is grown. Rice uses two to five times of the water required by other staple crops such as wheat or maize and uses about 30% of the freshwater consumed for agricultural crops worldwide. Water stress is defined as the lack of sufficient moisture for the normal growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Water is imperative for plant to complete its life cycle and it affects the physiological and biochemical pathways/metabolism such as photosynthesis, ion uptake, carbohydrate translocation and metabolism of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and prolonged stress can even affect plant survival. To reduce water use in rice cultivation while maintaining its high yield levels, water-saving regimes have been developed. Multi-environment evaluation of agronomic traits under stress condition is a prerequisite to identify highly tolerant rice genotypes for sustainable crop production.</p><p id="Par4">Phosphorus is the second most important macro nutrient that is essential for the entire growth period of any crop. P is required for major processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. It also plays important role in lipid, protein, and nucleic acid metabolism. Majority of the Indian soils have low P availability and to overcome the situation, P fertilizers are supplied externally. Even then the entire applied P does not become available to plants as P is lost in the processes of mineralization, fixation and leaching. In addition, rice crop has very low P use efficiency (~25%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has also been predicted that P source rock phosphate is non-renewable and finite, likely to be depleted in the next 50 to 60 years. Farming communities in developing countries face lots of problems to obtain P fertilizers due to its high cost and limited availability. Hence a practical solution is the development of varieties which perform well under low P conditions.</p><p id="Par5">There is a need of strategies which integrate genetic improvement targeting new varieties with improved capacities to efficiently use available nutrients and water resources along with management practices for sustainable global food security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Keeping in view, the prevailing situation of water scarcity and P deficiency, it is essential to identify rice genotypes that are tolerant and give stable yield in response to these abiotic stresses. Identification of suitable genotypes for multiple environments is a challenge in breeding programs. Selection of stable genotypes along with high yield is also essential. Thus effects of G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E interactions need to be considered for evaluation of genotypes for variety development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Stability analysis can be conducted on replicated trials over several environments following environment wise analysis of variance and pooled analysis of variance. Several stability statistics have been proposed to estimate G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E. The traditional measures use the coefficient of variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> environmental variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> stability variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> regression based parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and stability analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. AMMI (Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction) and GGE (Genotype and Genotype&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Environment Interaction) biplot are excellent tools for visual data analysis for different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In AMMI, the additive portion is analyzed through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and interaction effects through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. Biplots helps in displaying genotypic stability statistics and clustering of genotypes based on their performance in different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. GGE biplot gives more detailed graphical representation of mean values and stability and displays the which-won-where pattern of genotypes. It also identifies mega environments for selection and discriminating test environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The quality of selections was enhanced when stability variance was assessed along with yield or traits in combination with yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This model was effectively used in several crops for G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> especially for assessing grain yield.</p><p id="Par6"><italic>Pup1 (Phosphate uptake 1</italic>) is a major rice QTL identified in chromosome 12 for P deficiency tolerance in a population derived from Nipponbare/Kasalath and this QTL enhances the plants efficiency for higher uptake of P from the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. <italic>Pup1</italic> improves root growth and increases P uptake per root size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Selection of high yielding stable genotypes is essential in any crop breeding program. Consideration of effects of G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E interactions is very important for efficient breeding and evaluation of genotypes for variety development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. AMMI and GGE biplot are excellent tools for visual data analysis for different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In AMMI, the additive portion is analyzed through analysis of variance (ANOVA) and interaction effects through the principal component analysis (PCA) model. Biplots helps in displaying genotypic stability statistics and clustering of genotypes based on their performance across diverse environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. GGE biplot gives more detailed graphical representation of mean performance and stability and displays the which-won-where pattern of genotypes.

The quality of selections was enhanced when stability variance was assessed along with yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

GGE ideal genotype graph showed G17 is ideal for all the environments. Thus, G17 can be used as donor in plant breeding programs for yield and tiller number improvement at low P, water limited and normal conditions. G17 was also tested in multiple abiotic stress Physiology trials in different locations throughout India in AICRIP 2016 (All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Program 2016), G17 performed well across all the locations and it was ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> in tolerance to multiple abiotic stress. This data supports G17 as the ideal mutant to be used as donor for stable tolerance to abiotic stress or can be improved as a stress tolerant variety. G9 was a high yielder and with high tiller number in low P so it can be used as check while screening the mutants/ genotypes in low P condition. G107 and G132 were best suited to normal irrigated condition so they may be used as reference N22 mutants in normal conditions. It was interesting to note that G17 and G284 showed higher yield under water limited conditions than under normal irrigated conditions. Enhanced yield levels have been reported in water limited conditions previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The response depends on the level of water stress and also the genotypes used. Limited irrigation with moderate soil drying helps in enhanced root growth, root oxidation activity, and&#x000a0;photosynthetic rate. This also improves activity of key enzymes involved in sucrose-to-starch conversion in grains resulting in higher grain yield and water use efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Increase in cytokinin levels in the shoot in moderate drying causes greater grain-filling rate and a heavier grain weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However severe drying causes decreased cytokinin levels and are genotype dependent. Tiller number and yield were stable traits across all the environments in the present experiment. Mutants that gave higher yield also had higher tiller number in stress environments E1 and E2. This implies that along with yield, tiller number also can be considered for identification of stable high yielding genotypes under stress. Usually, high tiller number serves as a surrogate for improved root traits.</p><p id="Par42">Environment effect was high in case of grain yield and plant height but interaction effect was high for the expression of tiller number.

Compared to E1 and E3, E2 showed more interaction effect. The genotypes which performed better in E1 and E2 environments may be used as reference genotypes to screen for stress specific adaptations. Grain yield of mutants was more stable than plant height and tiller number across the environments. In all the environments, genotypic effect was high for yield and it gradually decreased for tiller number and plant height. Number of mutants which performed better than N22 in stress conditions was more in case of tiller number than for grain yield.

EMS induced mutagenesis can lead to discovery of very useful mutants such as G17 (NH686) and G176 (NH363) which are stably high yielding across normal and input limited stresses. Two lines G17 (NH686) and G284 (NH162) showed better mean performance in water limited condition compared to normal irrigated condition while other mutants showed yield reduction. G17(NH686) was the most stable genotype with highest rank in both stability studies of 6 mutants in 3 environments for 12 seasons as well as 300 mutants in 3 environments for 1 season. The three high yielding stable mutants performed similarly in both genotype environment interaction studies. Both limited water and phosphorus resulted in reduction of average yield and biomass. However, the extent of reduction varied for each trait in each environment. Low G effect and high E effect was observed for grain yield and plant height, considering G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E analysis over 3 environments for 300 genotypes. Similarly selected lines tested over multiple years also showed high E effect for grain yield. However, G&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;E interaction was more significant in case of tiller number indicating the specific adaptation of this trait in stress and normal conditions. Environments representing specific conditions clustered together and GGE plot classified normal and low P stress conditions into two different mega environments while moderate stress of limited water condition clustered between these two mega environments. The stable and high yielding mutants in stress and normal conditions can be evaluated in larger plots in multiple locations and used in basic studies on gene discovery and in rice improvement for sustainable rice production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
