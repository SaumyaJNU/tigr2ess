    "Metal(loid) contamination of food crops and soils resulting from mining activities has been a major concern due to the potential risk to humans. In this study, a total of 36 rice (home-grown and market rice), 38 vegetable, 10 drinking water, 4 river water, 18 soils and 30 urine samples were collected from an abandoned mining area or the local residents in China. Results showed that metal(loid) levels in some of the soil and drinking water samples exceeded the Chinese standard. Rice Cd concentration, rice Pb levels, and vegetable Pb levels exceeded the maximum permissible concentrations in 49%, 68%, and 42% of the samples, respectively. In gastric phases, the average Cd, Pb and As bioaccessibilities in rice were 72%, 70%, and 82%. In gastrointestinal phases, the average Cd, Pb and As bioaccessibilities in rice were 49%, 39%, and 94%. Vegetables (pak choi was selected) showed lower metal(loid) bioaccessibility than rice. The median concentrations of Cd, Pb and As in urine were 3.99, 4.82 and 64.8 Âµg L-1, respectivley. Rice had the highest contribution rates of Cd and Pb for daily intake, accounting for 114% and 210%, respectively. Vegetables contributed less, and very little contribution came from drinking water. Based on the bioaccessibility data, metal(loid) contamination around the mining area poses a great exposure risk to the local residents through consumption of food crops."
