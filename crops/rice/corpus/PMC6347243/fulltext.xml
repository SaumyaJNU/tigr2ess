The purpose of this study is to use a large dataset of milk composition from donors to a milk bank to: (1) describe the macronutrient variability in human milk and how it contributes to the ability to meet the protein and calorie targets for the preterm infant using fortification with commercially available multi-nutrient fortifiers; (2) assess how temporal versus subject effects explain macronutrient variability; (3) determine how macronutrient variability contributes to the nutrient distribution in pooled donor milk.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective, observational study that analyzes the macronutrient data of 1,119 human milk samples from 443 individual donors to a milk bank.

When pooling multiple donors, variability was reduced by increasing the number of donors randomly selected for a pool or targeted pooling based on macronutrient analysis of donor pools.

Higher nutrient intake has been shown to improve neurodevelopment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and reduce adverse events including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late onset sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Increasingly, human milk feeding is recognized as an important strategy for reducing the incidence of NEC among preterm infants, though nutrient fortification is typically required to support adequate in-hospital growth [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with protein often implicated as the rate-limiting macronutrient in human milk [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The underlying variability in human milk must be considered when trying to meet the nutrient needs of the preterm infant. Several trends in the macronutrient composition of human milk are well described in the literature: a decline in protein and an increase in fat content during the early days following parturition [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; greater protein content in preterm versus term milk up to 2 months postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; within feed differences in fat composition, with hind milk significantly higher in fat than fore milk [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that an overall subject-effect explains more of the nutrient variability in mature human milk than a temporal effect [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which may have significant implications for feeding the preterm infant.</p><p>Despite improvements in growth velocities in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants (less than 1500 grams), a study of over 360,000 VLBW infants between 2000 and 2013 found that 50% were classified as growth restricted at hospital discharge, defined as falling below the 10th percentile of weight for postmenstrual age on the Fenton growth chart [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The purpose of this study is to use a large dataset of milk composition from donors to a milk bank to: (1) describe the macronutrient variability in human milk and how it contributes to the ability to meet the protein and calorie targets for the preterm infant using fortification with commercially available multi-nutrient fortifiers; (2) assess how temporal versus subject effects explain macronutrient variability; (3) determine how macronutrient variability contributes to the nutrient distribution in pooled donor milk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective, observational study of the macronutrient composition of human milk provided by donors to the Mothers&#x02019; Milk Bank of North Texas (MMBNT; Fort Worth, TX) and received between November 2015 and July 2016. MMBNT follows the guidelines of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and accepts milk after donors pass a verbal and serological screening. As part of the screening process, donors provide written, informed consent that their milk, or data about their milk, may be used for research.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Milk samples and dataset</title><p>Approved donors collect and freeze expressed breast milk from individual pumping session in containers (e.g., plastic bags designed for human milk storage), typically in 1&#x02013;4 ounce volumes, until they are ready to send the aggregate collection of milk to MMBNT for processing. When MMBNT receives a donor shipment, the frozen containers from an individual donor are sorted by pump date, grouped into one or more Deposits, and stored, frozen, until processing. MMBNT records the estimated volume, expiration date, and donor ID for each Deposit. The expiration date is set to the earliest pump date in the Deposit plus one year. During daily milk processing at MMBNT, for each donor selected, one or more frozen Deposits are thawed and aggregated into a Donor Pool. That is, Donor Pools can consist of the milk from single or multiple Deposits, representing a range of pump dates, all from the same donor.</p><p>Once each donor&#x02019;s thawed milk is mixed into a Donor Pool, a sample of it is analyzed for fat, protein, and lactose using a MilkOScan FT 120 (Foss, Eden Prairie, MN). The MilkOScan uses Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to measure macronutrients based on unique vibration patterns of chemical functional groups in each class of macromolecule. Precision and accuracy for measuring protein and fat in human milk using IR technology and the MilkOScan have been reported by others, though variability with lactose measurement was observed, likely due to interference from human milk oligosaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MMBNT calibrates the MilkOScan monthly using human milk standards that have been validated at a USDA facility (USDA &#x00026; Marketing Services Dairy Program, Carrollton, TX) using enzymatic methods to quantify carbohydrates, the Kjeldahl method to quantify protein, and ether extraction to measure fat.</p><p>Macronutrient data for each Donor Pool is logged in MMBNT&#x02019;s Timeless (Timeless Medical Systems, Henderson, KY, USA) database and a spreadsheet. Other information available in MMBNT&#x02019;s dataset includes: Donor ID, Baby Date of Birth (DOB), Baby Term (full term, preterm, or deceased), Deposit Receipt Date, Deposit Expiration Date, and Deposit Volume.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Computed values</title><p>Several values were calculated. For Donor Pools that contained a single Deposit, Pump Date was computed using Deposit Expiration Date less one year. For Donor Pools with multiple Deposits, Pump Date was weighted based on the expiration date and volume of each Deposit within the Donor Pool. Lactation Stage was computed based on Pump Date less Baby DOB and was reported in weeks postpartum. Milk type was assigned based on analysis of the dataset to determine when protein concentrations stabilized in the first 7 weeks postpartum. Based on this analysis, Transition Milk was defined as Lactation Stage less than or equal to four weeks and Mature Milk was defined as Lactation Stage between 4 and 52 weeks.

Using the manufacturer&#x02019;s mixing instructions and assuming milk composition of 1 g/dL protein, 7 g/dL lactose, 3.5 g/dL fat, and 19 kcal/ounce, Similac Human Milk Fortifier Concentrated Liquid (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) mixed to 24 kcal would increase protein by 1.0 g/dL and was considered a basic protein fortifier. Similac Human Milk Fortifier Hydrolyzed Protein Concentrated Liquid and Prolacta +6 (Prolacta Biosciences, City of Industries, CA) would increase protein by 1.5 g/dL and were considered intermediate protein fortifiers. Prolacta +10 (Prolacta Biosciences, City of Industries, CA) would increase protein by 2.5 g/dL and was considered a high protein fortifier [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Both Similac fortifiers would increase calories by 3.8 kcal/ounce and were considered a basic calorie fortifier. Prolacta +6 would increase calories by 6.8 kcal/ounce and was considered an intermediate calorie fortifier and Prolacta +10 was considered a high calorie fortifier, providing an extra 11.6 kcal/ounce. The macronutrient profile of each Donor Pool was used to compute feeding volumes necessary to achieve protein requirements of 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 g/kg/day using basic, intermediate, and high protein fortifiers. Similarly, feeding volumes necessary to achieve calorie targets of 110 and 135 kcal/kg/day were also computed. Feeding volumes were compared to two reference values: 200 ml/kg/day which is the upper range defined by ESPGHAN (10), and 160 ml/kg/day, which is a common goal volume used in United States NICUs [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Fortification and feeding volume calculations were performed independently by two researchers to ensure agreement. All identifying information was removed from the dataset prior to analysis.</p><p>Data were excluded for multiple reasons. For example, for some Donor Pools, the calculated Pump Date was earlier than the Infant DOB, likely due to data entry errors (n = 28; 1.5% of Donor Pools). For the purpose of maintaining conservative expiration dates, when milk is donated without a pump date on the label, MMBNT assigns the pump date as the infant DOB. For this reason, Donor Pools with a Pump Date equal to the Infant DOB were excluded from the analysis (n = 41; 2.2% of Donor Pools). Donor Pools from unique donors that had identical macronutrient values is suggestive of final pooling values versus individual donor pool values and were therefor excluded (n = 170; 9.0% of Donor Pools). To avoid masking effects associated with Stage of Lactation, Donor Pools that contained multiple Deposits for which the difference between earliest and latest Pump Dates was greater than 7 days were also excluded from the analysis (n = 537; 28.3% of Donor Pools).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was conducted in Minitab (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA), Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and SAS Enterprise Edition 9.4 (SAS Corporation, Cary, NC, USA). The full dataset was used to describe prevalence of Donor Pools by Baby Term (Full, Preterm, Deceased) and by Lactation Stage (Transition, Mature, Extended), with differences in distribution evaluated using a Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test. Descriptive statistics were computed on a subset of the data containing a single Donor Pool per donor in order not to violate statistical rules of independence between observations in a dataset. For donors with multiple Donor Pools, the first donation chronologically was used. Within this data subset, differences in Lactation Stage were evaluated using one-way ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test for multiple comparisons, and theoretical effects of fortification were explored. To explore subject versus time effects, a subset of the data containing donors with multiple Donor Pools was used. Coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) were calculated to determine the impact of Lactation Stage (a time-effect) and Donor ID (a subject-effect). The full dataset, which reflects the actual population of Donor Pools available for creating pooled donor human milk, was used to simulate random pooling of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 donors per pool. Briefly, the simulation involved confirming independence between deposit volume, protein, and fat and using historical data; generating values for these characteristics of each deposit independently using the empirical distributions; combining deposits into random pools using a variety of numbers of donors per pool; and calculating volume-weighted averages. Two-thousand random pools were generated for each number of donors in a pool (1 through 5). Simulated results were compared to historical data from MMBNT of pools created between November 2015 and July 2016 to target 19+ kcal/ounce using macronutrient profiles from individual Donor Pools.

In our dataset of human milk from over 400 individuals, basic protein fortification could not achieve protein targets of 3.5 g/kg in more than 25% of transition milk samples, and over 75% of mature milk samples while staying below feeding volumes of 160 ml/kg. Intermediate protein fortification was able to meet protein targets of 4.0 g/kg in over 75% of transition milk samples and approximately 50% of mature milk samples at daily feeding volumes below 160 ml/kg. When protein targets increase to 4.5 g/kg, feeding volumes must exceed 160 ml/kg in the majority of samples using intermediate protein fortifiers. High protein fortification could meet all protein targets in all samples at feeding volumes below 160 ml/kg. Higher calorie targets (135 kcal/kg) were not met in over 75% of samples with basic calorie fortification, and approximately 25% of samples with intermediate calorie fortification, while staying within daily feeding volumes of 160 ml/kg.</p><p>The impact of human milk macronutrient variability on pooled donor milk is not well understood. Smith et al. reported creamatocrit values ranged from 1.7 to 7.3% in 22 samples of pooled donor milk from 3 to 4 donors [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A study of 33 pooled donor milk samples from 51 donors reported that fat was the most variable nutrient, with a coefficient of variation of 49%, though number of donors per pool was not reported [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our simulation of randomly pooled donors, the number of donors included in each pool increased the percentage of pools reaching target fat and protein values. Targeted pooling based on macronutrient analysis of Donor Pools was especially effective at achieving a minimum level of fat in pooled donor milk. Each 1 gram/dL decrease in the fat content of human milk translates into a reduction of 14.4 kcal/kg/day at feeding volumes of 160 ml/kg/day. Energy intake in the preterm population is significantly associated with weight, length, and head growth [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Given that fat is a major contributor to the energy content in donor milk, reducing this variability is warranted when feeding nutritionally at-risk populations.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Limitations</title><p>The dataset represents primarily milk from women who delivered at term. In the NICU environment when feeding infants with mother&#x02019;s own milk, we would expect higher protein content in the milk of mothers delivering preterm. This would translate into lower feeding volumes to reach protein targets. A systematic review of preterm and term milk composition found that the average protein difference was only 0.2 g/dL by the second week postpartum [<xref rid="pone.0210610.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which would translate into volume reductions of 17 to 23 ml/kg/day over those reported in this study. This suggests that many samples, even when adjusted for higher protein levels expected in preterm milk, would require more than 150 to 160 ml/kg/day of feeding volumes in order to meet high protein targets. Donor Pools represented milk from a range of donors at each lactation stages; therefore, some temporal changes that occur in the early postpartum period, including an increase in fat and lactose, were not observed in this dataset. Historical results from targeted pooling are based on MMBNT production dates, while the Donor Pools for the simulation are based on receipt data; therefore, not all Donor Pools from the simulation may be represented in the historical targeted pooling results. However, the large dataset sizes and extensive date ranges contribute to a representative sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The macronutrient profile of human milk varies significantly by subject, with differences in fat composition explaining up to 80% of the difference in calories. Individual variability can impact nutrients in pooled donor milk. This variability can be reduced by increasing the number of donors in a pool or by target pooling. While protein is frequently considered a rate limiting nutrient for preterm infant growth, providing adequate total calories is also an important consideration in the NICU. Basic protein fortification of human milk typically requires feeding volumes above 160 ml/kg to reach protein targets of 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg. There is an urgent need for research into how the nutrient variability in human milk impacts preterm infant growth, body composition, and short-term and long-term health outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210610.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Macronutrient Data for Donor Pools and Historical Target Pools.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210610.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thank you to Mothers&#x02019; Milk Bank of North Texas for access to this dataset, and to the many mothers who have donated their milk to MMBNT.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DOB</term><def><p>date of birth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HMBANA</term><def><p>Human Milk Banking Association of North America</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMBNT</term><def><p>Mothers&#x02019; Milk Bank North Texas</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEC</term><def><p>necrotizing enterocolitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICU</term><def><p>neonatal intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VLBW</term><def><p>very low birth weight</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0210610.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ong</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Casta&#x000f1;eda-Guti&#x000e9;rrez</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Forsyth</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Godfrey</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Koletzko</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
