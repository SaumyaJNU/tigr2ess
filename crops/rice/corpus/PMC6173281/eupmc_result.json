    "Background:Compared to white rice, brown rice induces a lower glycemic response in healthy and diabetic humans. This effect is partly attributed to the higher amounts of water- or oil-soluble bran components and dietary fiber in brown rice. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation with oil-soluble rice bran triterpenoids (RBTs; triterpene alcohol and sterol prepared from rice bran) might reduce the incidence of postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy humans. Objective:We examined the acute effects of a single RBT-supplemented meal on the postprandial blood glucose responses of healthy male adults in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Design:Nineteen subjects consumed a test meal containing either placebo- or RBT-supplemented olive oil. Blood biomarkers were evaluated in a fasting state and up to 240 min postprandially. Results:Compared to the placebo-supplemented meal, the RBT-supplemented meal significantly suppressed the increase in postprandial blood glucose level. A subclass analysis revealed that RBT-supplemented oil significantly reduced blood glucose increases in subjects with higher postprandial blood glucose elevations. Postprandial increases in blood insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels did not differ between the groups. Conclusion:These results suggest that RBT consumption improves postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy humans, especially those with higher postprandial glucose increases."
