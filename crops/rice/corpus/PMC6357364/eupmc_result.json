    "BACKGROUND:Adventitious root (AR) formation is a complex genetic trait, which is controlled by various endogenous and environmental cues. Auxin is known to play a central role in AR formation; however, the mechanisms underlying this role are not well understood. RESULTS:In this study, we showed that a previously identified auxin signaling module, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR(ARF)7/ARF19-LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN(LBD)16/LBD18 via AUXIN1(AUX1)/LIKE-AUXIN3 (LAX3) auxin influx carriers, which plays important roles in lateral root formation, is involved in AR formation in Arabidopsis. In aux1, lax3, arf7, arf19, lbd16 and lbd18 single mutants, we observed reduced numbers of ARs than in the wild type. Double and triple mutants exhibited an additional decrease in AR numbers compared with the corresponding single or double mutants, respectively, and the aux1 lax3 lbd16 lbd18 quadruple mutant was devoid of ARs. Expression of LBD16 or LBD18 under their own promoters in lbd16 or lbd18 mutants rescued the reduced number of ARs to wild-type levels. LBD16 or LBD18 fused to a dominant SRDX repressor suppressed promoter activity of the cell cycle gene, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase(CDK)A1;1, to some extent. Expression of LBD16 or LBD18 was significantly reduced in arf7 and arf19 mutants during AR formation in a light-dependent manner, but not in arf6 and arf8. GUS expression analysis of promoter-GUS reporter transgenic lines revealed overlapping expression patterns for LBD16, LBD18, ARF7, ARF19 and LAX3 in AR primordia. CONCLUSION:These results suggest that the ARF7/ARF19-LBD16/LBD18 transcriptional module via the AUX1/LAX3 auxin influx carriers plays an important role in AR formation in Arabidopsis."
