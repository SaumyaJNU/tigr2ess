    "High-resistant starch cereal crops with the inhibition of the starch branching enzyme (SBE) have been widely studied. However, the effects of the inhibition of SBE on waxy cereal crops are unclear. A transgenic rice line (GTR) derived from a japonica waxy rice cultivar Guang-ling-xiang-nuo (GLXN) has been developed through antisense RNA inhibition of both SBEI and SBEIIb. In this study, GLXN and GTR were cultivated in the dark only in deionized Hâ‚‚O, and their shoot and root growth, starch in situ degradation, and starch property changes were investigated during seedling growth. Compared with GLXN, GTR showed a significantly slow seedling growth, which was not due to the embryo size and vitality. The slow degradation of starch in the seed restrained the seedling growth. GLXN starch was completely degraded gradually from the proximal to distal region of the embryo and from the outer to inner region in the endosperm, but GTR starch in the peripheral region of the endosperm was not completely degraded, and the starch residual was located in the outside of the compound starch though its degradation pattern was similar to GLXN. During seedling growth, GLXN starch had the same A-type crystallinity and a similar ordered structure, but the crystallinity changed from the CA-type to B-type and the ordered structure gradually increased in the GTR starch. The above results indicated that GTR had a heterogeneous starch distributed regionally in the endosperm. The starch in the peripheral region of the endosperm had a B-type crystallinity, which was located in the outside of the compound starch and significantly increased the resistance to in situ degradation, leading to the seedling slow growth."
