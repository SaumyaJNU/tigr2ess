Introduction</title><p>Starch is the major storage carbohydrate in cereal endosperm and provides energy and nourishment for humans. In normal cereal crops, starch mainly consists of amylose and amylopectin. The content and structure of amylose and amylopectin determine the physicochemical properties of starch and influence the applications of cereal seeds [<xref rid="B1-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Amylose in cereal endosperm is mainly synthesized by granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), and amylopectin is mainly synthesized by the soluble starch synthase, starch branching enzyme (SBE), and starch debranching enzyme [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The loss-of-function mutant of GBSSI can produce waxy crops composed of amylose-free starch and influence the eating and cooking quality of cereal seeds [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Suppressing or eliminating SBE activities in cereal endosperm can change the amylopectin structure, decrease amylopectin synthesis, and increase the amylose content, leading to a significant increase in resistance starch (RS) [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. RS is an important starch component, which cannot be digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract but functions as a substrate for bacterial fermentation in the large intestine [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Foods with high RS have health benefits including lowering glycemic and insulin responses and reducing the risk of developing type II diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, many high-RS crops have been cultivated via inhibition of SBE expression or mutation of SBE genes [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>For cereal crops, endosperm starch provides energy and nutrition for grain germination and seedling growth. For normal cereal crops, seed starch can be homogeneously degraded gradually from the embryo and aleurone layer during seedling growth [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, for the maize <italic>sbe I</italic> mutant with changed amylopectin structure and amylose content, seed starch is resistant to amylase hydrolysis during grain germination and seedling growth, leading to the inhibition of seedling growth [<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A high-amylose and RS rice line with the expression inhibition of SBEI/IIb has a 60% amylose content and a 14.6% RS in endosperm [<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Its amylopectin branching degree decreases and the branch-chain lengthens, leading to a crystalline structure change from A-type to C-type [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During the seedling growth in the dark only in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, the slow degradation of seed starch, which is due to the high resistance of amylopectin long branch-chains and B-type crystallinity to in situ degradation, restrains the growth of the shoot and root [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Shaik et al. [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] thought that when the starch granule and molecular structure are changed, its amylase hydrolysis properties also change during grain germination and seedling growth and further influence the remobilization of seed storage material and the establishment of the seedling.</p><p>So far, the high-RS cereal crops with the inhibition of SBE expression or mutation of SBE genes all have high amylose content [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The high amylose in endosperms significantly influences the eating and cooking quality, and inhibits the in vivo digestion of starch when fed as foods and the in situ degradation during seedling growth [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The deficiency of GBSSI leads to no amylose synthesis in both GLXN and GTR [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In GTR, the expression and activity of SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb were significantly declined according to the results of the reverse transcription-PCR analysis, immunoblotting assay, and native PAGE/activity staining of starch biosynthesis-related enzymes in developing endosperm [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

In this study, the shoot and root growth, starch in situ degradation, and starch property changes of GLXN and GTR were investigated during seedling growth in the dark and only in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O.

Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-19-03397"><title>2.1. Growth Dynamics of Rice Seedlings in the Dark Only in Deionized Water</title><p>In order to ensure that the energy and nutrient substance needed for grain germination and seedling growth were provided only through degradation of seed materials, rice grains were cultivated in the dark only in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O according to the method by Shaik et al. [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It was noteworthy that the deficiency of mineral elements such as calcium and potassium could influence seedling growth, but this growing condition had effects on the in situ degradation and characterization of endosperm starch during seedling growth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the grain germination and seedling growth in the dark only in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O. The grain germination began from 2 days after imbibition (DAI) and was slightly slower in GTR than in GLXN. The seedling growth, including shoot height and root length, was significantly slower in GTR than in GLXN from 4 DAI. The shoot height, shoot weight, and root weight were further quantitatively measured on the 30 seed basis and on the same weight basis of pre-germinated dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The shoot height, shoot weight, and root weight was significantly lower in GTR than in GLXN, indicating that the GTR seed materials were more resistant to degradation and provided less energy and nutrient substance for seedling growth than did the GLXN seed materials. The present results agreed with the previous reports that the repression of SBE expression in endosperm can inhibit seedling growth [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-19-03397"><title>2.2. In Vitro Culture of Mature Embryo</title><p>In order to exclude whether the slow growth of GTR seedling resulted from the embryo size and vitality, the in vitro culture of the mature embryo was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f003">Figure 3</xref>). No significant difference was detected in seedling growth at 6 days after in vitro culture between GLXN and GTR. This result demonstrated that the slow growth of the GTR seedling resulted from the slow degradation of seed materials and was not due to the embryo size and vitality. A similar result was also reported by Pan et al. [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-19-03397"><title>2.3. The Consumption of Seed Material and Its Relationship with Seedling Growth</title><p>The seed dry weight was measured during seedling growth on a 30 seed basis and on the same weight basis of pre-germinated dry seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,D). The decrease of seed weight was significantly slower in GTR than in GLXN, leading to the seed weight being higher in GTR than in GLXN after 12 DAI though the seed weight was higher in GLXN than in GTR before germination. The seed biomass is remobilized to the emerging root and shoot of seedling [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, the relationships between the decreased seed weight and the root weight, shoot weight, and seedling weight (root and seedling weight) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C,E,F). The high correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic> &#x02265; 0.991) showed that the decreased seed weight and seedling growth had a highly positive relationship, and the degraded seed materials were used for seedling growth. Compared with GLXN, the slow growth of the GTR seedling in the dark only in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O resulted from the slow degradation of seed materials. Similar phenomena are also observed in high-amylose rice and barley with an inhibition of SBE expression [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Starch is the major component in rice seed. The starch weight in the seeds was also measured on a 30 seed basis and on the same weight basis of pre-germinated dry seeds during seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,D). The starch was rapidly degraded before 12 DAI, but the degradation rate was faster in GLXN than in GTR, indicating that the starch in the GTR seed was more resistant to in situ degradation than the GLXN starch. The high correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic> &#x02265; 0.991) also indicated that the degraded starch was used for seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C,E,F). It was noteworthy that the endosperm starch in GLXN was completely degraded at 16 DAI, but the endosperm starch in GTR had a similar content between 12 and 16 DAI and maintained a relatively high level. These results showed that residual starch in GTR seeds of 12 and 16 DAI had a high resistance to in situ degradation during seedling growth.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-19-03397"><title>2.4. In Situ Degradation of Endosperm Starch during Seedling Growth</title><p>The whole seeds were longitudinally sectioned and stained with Schiff&#x02032;s reagent to exhibit the in situ degradation of starch during seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The starch was stained red. For GLXN, the whole seed showed that starch was degraded gradually from the proximal to the distal region of the embryo and from the outer to the inner part of the endosperm. At 12 DAI, only a little starch existed in the distal region of the embryo. At 16 DAI, the starch was completely degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The region magnification showed that the starch close to embryo had been completely degraded, and that the inner region of the seed and the distal region from that embryo had an intact compound starch at 4 DAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). The inner region of the seed had been completely degraded and the starch close to the aleurone layer at the distal region from the embryo was partly degraded but the distal region remained intact at 8 DAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). The above-degraded pattern of endosperm starch in GLXN agreed with that of other normal cereal crops and was due to the amylase which is synthesized in the embryo and the aleurone layer and secreted into the endosperm cells from the outer to the inner layer to degrade starch [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The present results also indicated that compound starch in different regions of seed could be completely degraded, though their degradation time was different.</p><p>For GTR, the degradation pattern of the starch in seeds was completely different from that of GLXN. The starch was degraded from the periphery of the embryo and proceeded to the distal region of the embryo, which was similar to that of GLXN, but the starch was not completely degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The region magnification of the seed showed that the inner endosperm starch close to the embryo was completely degraded but the peripheral endosperm starch close to the embryo was partly degraded at 4 DAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). At 8 DAI, the endosperm starch in the middle region of the seed began to degrade, but the starch residue in the peripheral region close to the embryo still existed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). At 12 DAI, the inner endosperm starch of seed was completely degraded and that in the distal region from the embryo was also partly degraded. However, the inner parts of the compound starch in the peripheral region of the endosperm were completely degraded, but its outer part was not degraded completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f009">Figure 9</xref>c). At 16 DAI, the inner endosperm starch from the embryo to the distal region was all completely degraded, but the peripheral endosperm starch was not completely degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f009">Figure 9</xref>d). The present results indicated that the starch in GTR seed was not homogeneously distributed. The high-amylose rice derived from the <italic>indica</italic> rice cultivar Te-qing with an inhibition of the SBEI/IIb expression has polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch granules in the endosperm. They were specifically distributed in different regions from the inner to outer parts of the endosperm [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). During seedling growth, the starch in the inner region of the endosperm was completely degraded, but that in the middle and outer regions of the endosperm were partly degraded. The residual starch is located in the peripheral region of the aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch granules [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, though the aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch granules were not detected in the GTR endosperm, the starch residual was also detected in the outer part of the compound starch in the peripheral region of the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f009">Figure 9</xref>(d1&#x02013;d3)).

Characterization of Endosperm Starch during Seedling Growth</title><p>Residual starch in seed was isolated during seedling growth. The iodine absorption spectrum of the starch is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f010">Figure 10</xref>. During seedling growth, the spectrum had no significant change in the GLXN starch, but exhibited a significant difference in GTR starch. The maximum absorption wavelength (&#x003bb;max), blue value (BV, absorbance at 680 nm), and the optical density 620 nm/550 nm ratio (OD 620/550) of starch are presented in <xref rid="ijms-19-03397-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. They were similar among the starches from GLXN seeds of different DAIs, but the &#x003bb;max and OD 620/550 gradually increased and the BV significantly increased from 4 to 12 DAI in the GTR residual starch. Iodine can bind the amylose and amylopectin branch-chains, producing starches having different iodine absorption spectra due to the different contents of amylose and the branch-chain length of amylopectin. The &#x003bb;max can reflect the chain length of amylose and amylopectin, the OD620/550 can indicate the relative content of the longer branch-chain segments in starch, and the BV can exhibit an iodine affinity with a high value, having a high amylose content or long amylopectin branch-chain [<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The present study showed that the starches from the GLXN seeds of different DAIs had similar iodine absorption spectra, indicating that the starch in different regions of the seed was homogeneous in the amylopectin structure. However, the starches from the GTR seeds of different DAIs had different iodine absorption spectra, indicating that the starch in different regions of the seed was heterogeneous in the amylopectin structure and that the starches with short branch-chains degraded more rapidly than the those with long branch-chains. In normal barley and rice seedling growth, amylose and amylopectin were simultaneously degraded; however, in high-amylose barley and rice with inhibition of SBE expression, the amylose is preferably degraded compared to the amylopectin, and the long branch-chains of amylopectin were more resistant to hydrolysis than the short branch-chains during seedling growth [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of starches are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f011">Figure 11</xref>.

For GTR, significant changes were found in the starches from the seeds of different DAIs. The starch from the GTR seed of 1 DAI had a weak diffraction peak at 5.6&#x000b0; 2&#x003b8;, a characteristic peak of the B-type crystallinity, and an obvious shoulder peak at 18&#x000b0; 2&#x003b8;, indicating that the starch in the GTR seed of 1 DAI had A- and B-type crystallinity and that the A-type crystallinity was higher than the B-type crystallinity, resulting in a C<sub>A</sub>-type starch. With the seedling growth, the shoulder peak at 18&#x000b0; 2&#x003b8; gradually becomes weak and vanishes, the peak at 23&#x000b0; 2&#x003b8; gradually widens and becomes two peaks at 22&#x000b0; and 24&#x000b0; 2&#x003b8;, indicating that the starch changed from the C<sub>A</sub>-type to the B-type with the growth of the seedling. A similar phenomenon has been reported in high-amylose rice with the inhibition of the SBE expression [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The short branch-chains and closed branching points of amylopectin can favorably form A-type crystallinity, and the long branch-chains and distant branching points of amylopectin form B-type crystallinity [<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The long branch-chains of amylopectin increased the resistance to in situ degradation [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transforms infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of starches are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f012">Figure 12</xref>. Starch has an amorphous and ordered structure, and the FTIR peaks at 1045 and 1022 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> are associated with the ordered and amorphous regions in starch, respectively [<xref rid="B25-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For GLXN seeds, the spectra of the starches had no significant change during the seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f012">Figure 12</xref>A), but for GTR seeds, the peak at 1022 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> gradually decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-03397-f012">Figure 12</xref>B). The present results indicated that the ordered and amorphous structures in GLXN starch were simultaneously degraded, but the amorphous structure was degraded faster than the ordered structure in the GTR starch. Similar phenomena have also been reported in high-amylose rice with the inhibition of the SBE expression [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-03397" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-19-03397"><title>3.

Conclusions</title><p>Compared with GLXN, GTR showed a significantly slow seedling growth. The slow degradation of starch in GTR seed restrained the seedling growth. GLXN starch was homogeneous in endosperm and completely degraded gradually from the proximal to the distal region of the embryo and from the outer to the inner part in the endosperm. However, GTR starch was heterogeneous in the endosperm, and the starch located in the outer layer of compound starch in the peripheral region of the endosperm was not completely degraded. During seedling growth, GLXN starch had the same A-type crystallinity and similar ordered structure, but the crystallinity changed from the C<sub>A</sub>-type to B-type and the ordered structure gradually increased in GTR starch. Therefore, the B-type crystallinity located in the outer part of the compound starch had a high resistance to in situ degradation in GTR endosperm and inhibited seedling growth.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.W. conceived this project.
