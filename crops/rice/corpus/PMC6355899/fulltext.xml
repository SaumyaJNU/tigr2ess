These characteristics significantly increase the difficulty of exploiting novel germplasm induced by physical or chemical mutagens. In this study, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system based on endogenous tRNA processing to induce high efficiency and inheritable mutagenesis in cabbage. Using the phytoene desaturase gene <italic>BoPDS</italic>, the S-receptor kinase gene <italic>BoSRK</italic>, and the male-sterility-associated gene <italic>BoMS1</italic> as the target genes, multisite and multiple gene mutations were achieved using a construct with tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture to express multiple sgRNAs. The <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene mutation suppressed self-incompatibility completely, converting the self-incompatible line into a self-compatible line. In addition, the <italic>BoMS1</italic> gene mutation produced a completely male-sterile mutant, which was highly cross compatible with its nonmutant isoline at the flowering stage as a result of a simultaneous <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene mutation, enabling the economic propagation of the male-sterile line through bee-mediated cross-pollination. Interestingly, higher site mutation efficiency was detected when a guide sequence was inserted into a location in the tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture that was distal from the upstream Pol III promoter. In addition, mutation sites were also detected in the paralogous genes of the <italic>BoPDS</italic> and <italic>BoSRK</italic> genes that had fully consistent sequences or base mismatches but beyond the &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; region in the spacer sequence compared with the target sgRNAs.

Cabbage plants normally do not self-pollinate, making the use of traditional mutagens difficult. Hongyuan Song of Southwest University therefore turned to CRISPR/Cas9, a system which can introduce precise mutations into specific genes. Song&#x02019;s team targeted three genes: one related to coloration, another to self-incompatibility, and a third involved in pollen development. They began by mutating each gene separately to test the system&#x02019;s efficiency. Next, they built a CRISPR/Cas9 construct that would simultaneously mutate the pollen gene and the self-incompatibility gene. One-third of the plants produced using the construct had mutations in both of the target genes. These findings demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is a valuable tool for trait improvement and genetic research in cabbage.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFD0101804) the Science and Technology Innovation Program for the Social Undertakings and the People's Livelihood in Chongqing (cstc2015shms-ztzx80005; cstc2015shms-ztzx80007; cstc2015shms-ztzx80009).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Methods for rapidly and efficiently editing plant genomes are useful for research into gene function and crop improvement. In the past decades, chemical or physical mutagenesis methods were extensively used to produce random mutations that were subsequently screened for the phenotypes of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Compared with such traditional random mutagenesis, which is inefficient and laborious, targeted gene editing technologies can markedly improve the process of creating mutants. In recent years, methods involving sequence-specific nucleases to create targeted DNA double-stranded break (DSB) genetic tools, such as zinc-finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), were used for genome editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Given the substantial technical complexity and the experience required to design and assemble the gene constructs, these methods were not widely used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recently, a new gene-editing tool, the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein (Cas) system (CRISPR/Cas9) with its high efficiency, low cost, simple design, and versatility has been demonstrated to be efficient for gene disruption in many plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, <italic>N. tabacum</italic>, rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, tomato, potato, sweet orange, poplar, and liverwort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Many important traits are often regulated by multiple genes or paralogous genes. To improve such traits requires the editing of multiple genes. Fortunately, the Cas9 protein can be directed to specific sites by different single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that provide an opportunity to achieve multiplex gene editing by expressing Cas9 along with the multiple sgRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In plants, the most common strategy is to stack multiple independent sgRNA-expressing cassettes in a single construct and to deliver the construct into plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, this sgRNA-expressing strategy is challenging for most organisms due to the limitations of the delivery method and the vector capacity. By using a synthetic gene with tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture, multiple sgRNAs were efficiently and precisely produced in vivo in rice by the endogenous RNases, RNase P and Z, for the first time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, the tRNA-processing sgRNA expression system was successfully demonstrated in other organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The CRISPR/Cas9 system is becoming a powerful tool for genome editing in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, but, in <italic>Brassica</italic>, only a few successful instances of genome editing have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Fortunately, the <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene mutations were detected in five other plants that harbored the <italic>BoMS1</italic> gene mutation, so the simultaneous mutation efficiency of both genes was 27.78% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

A higher mutation frequency (44.44%) was detected at the C site than at the A and B sites in the form of biallelic mutations (line B-1 line), heterozygous mutations (lines A-1 and B-2), chimeric mutations (A-2 and C-4 lines) and wild type (line D-2). A mutation frequency of 63.89% at the D site was detected in the form of a chimeric mutation (lines A-1, A-2 and D-2), a heterozygous mutation (line B-2), a biallelic mutation (line B-1) and mono-allelic homozygous mutations (line C-4) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

Plants of the other five lines proved to not be phenotypically different from the wild-type plants at the vegetative stage. After flowering, we found that only the C-4 line exhibited complete male sterility; the filaments becoming shorter, and the anthers failed to produce viable pollen, but the style of line C-4 was indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, b: a1&#x02013;a3 show the wild type; b1&#x02013;b3 show the C-4 mutant). The phenotype of pollen development was examined using light microscopy. Unlike the situation in the wild type, the microspores and the tapetum of the C-4 mutant degenerated to form a mass of undifferentiated cells; ultimately, the anther locule was completely empty with no pollen development (Figs.&#x000a0;6a4 and b4). The cross-compatibility at the flowering stage between the C-4 plant and the wild type plant was determined by examining different traits, including pollen germination and the cross-compatibility index. A mono-allelic homozygous mutation of the <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene in the C-4 plant was detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). As expected, a large number of pollen grains that germinated on the stigma and bundles of the pollen tubes were observed in the style of the C-4 plant pollinated by pollen grains from the wild type plant at the flowering stage, a result that was not obviously different from the situation with pollination at the bud stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c1, c2</xref>). We found that the C-4 plant had a markedly elongated silique with a normal amount of seeds following pollination by wild type pollen at the flowering stage or at the bud stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c3&#x02013;c8</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and wheat, high site mutation efficiency could be obtained when the guiding sequence was inserted at a location that was proximal to the upstream Pol III promoter in the tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, a comparable mutation frequency in rice was also detected even when the guiding sequences were inserted at different locations in the tRNA-sgRNA architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In this study, higher site mutation efficiency was obtained when the guiding sequence was inserted at a location that was distal to the upstream Pol III promoter (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), a finding that was similar to that reported in cotton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, similar results were also found for tobacco <italic>PDS</italic> and <italic>Sulfur</italic> (<italic>Sul</italic>) gene modification (unpublished results).</p><p id="Par25">Recently, a report described high-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, a result that was in contrast to two earlier reports in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. This inconsistency could be because too few mutants sample were performed off-target analysis in the previous studies, and different promoters were used to drive Cas9 expression, since an increased dose of the Cas9/sgRNA complexes significantly enhances the frequency of off-target mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, we did not analyze the potential off-target loci following the PAM sequences within the cabbage genome, but those sites in the paralogous genes <italic>Bol016089</italic> and <italic>BoSLG3</italic>, which were highly homologous to the target sites in the <italic>BoPDS</italic> and <italic>BoSRK3</italic> genes, respectively, were examined. The sgRNAs can accommodate mismatches varying by as many as five nucleotides in the 5&#x02032; upstream region, but the PAM-proximal &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; region comprising 10&#x02013;12 bp is crucial to the Cas9 cleavage activity, and mismatches in this region usually lead to a decrease in or even complete abolition of the target cleavage activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, no mutations were detected in the putative off-target sites as a result of one to three mismatches, which were found in the &#x0201c;seed sequence&#x0201d; of potential off-target sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this study, there were one to four mismatches in the &#x0201c;seed sequence&#x0201d; for the A, B, and C putative sites of the <italic>BoSLG3</italic> gene, and, as expected, no mutations were detected in the putative off-target sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). However, mutations were detected at the putative C and D sites of the <italic>Bol016089</italic> gene with one mismatch, but it was out of the &#x0201c;seed sequence&#x0201d; of the guide sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). The frequency of off-target mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas9 is typically well below that caused by chemical and physical mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, unlike CRISPR-based gene therapy in humans, any off-target modification in plants can be removed by segregation, if necessary.</p><p id="Par26">Male sterility can guarantee high-purity F<sub>1</sub> hybrid cabbage seeds, which have recently become economically significant, and male-sterile parents are used for cabbage hybrid breeding by plant breeders in some countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, labor costs for F<sub>1</sub> hybrid seed production based on the male-sterile approach cannot be reduced or may even be increased due to the self-incompatibility in the maintainer line, the male-sterile line, and the paternal line. <italic>SRK</italic> is one member of the <italic>S</italic>-locus gene family involved in the regulation of cabbage self-incompatibility. The mutation of the <italic>SRK</italic> gene resulted in a self-compatible line in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> and <italic>Brassica rapa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In this study, knockout of the <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene completely abolished the self-incompatibility of the cabbage self-incompatible line &#x0201c;F416&#x0201d;, the self-compatibility index of the <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene mutants at the flowering stage were clearly higher than in the wild type &#x0201c;F416&#x0201d;; the mutants had become completely self-compatible lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, direct modification of the <italic>SRK</italic> gene in the male-sterile parent, the maintainer line and the paternal line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, to reduce the costs of cabbage hybrid seed production, is obviously a more efficient way than the backcrossing strategy using rare natural self-compatible mutants.</p><p id="Par27">Currently, ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) from radish (<italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>) accounts for the vast majority of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> male-sterility types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It is well known that the prevalence of a single cytoplasm in commercial crop cultivars has potential risks due to the associated low genetic diversity; the Texas cytoplasm, which was widely used as a source of CMS to produce maize hybrid cultivars, resulted in maize southern corn leaf blight and yellow leaf blight epidemics in 1970&#x02013;1971 in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, to reduce the risk of a single cytoplasm in cabbage hybrid breeding programs, the male-sterile cabbage genetic resources can be expanded by mutating the nuclear genes regulating microsporogenesis, stamen development, or microgametogenesis.</p><p id="Par28">In this study, a biallelic mutation at the D site of the <italic>BoMS1</italic> gene in the C-4 plant induced complete male sterility with no pollen grains produced in the anther locules of the sterile mutant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), and with the phenotype similar to the mutants of the <italic>MS1</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and pepper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

As expected, the C-4 mutant of the <italic>BoMS1</italic> gene exhibited complete male sterility without any morphological defects. However, male sterility controlled by recessive nuclear genes is difficult to use due to problems encountered in its maintenance, and 100% male sterility was not obtained. In 2002, strategies to obtain full maintainer lines for the male-sterile parents controlled by recessive nuclear genes were proposed by Perez-Prat and van Lookeren Campagne<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and commercial applications of the recessive male-sterile lines have been achieved in maize and rice based on these strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The C-4 male-sterile mutant is highly cross compatible with the maintainer line (wild type with same S-allele) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). The results indicate that the propagation of the cabbage male-sterile line is economically feasible by the simultaneous mutation of the <italic>BoSRK</italic> gene and the male-sterility gene, indicating that an F<sub>1</sub> hybrid cabbage seed production system from the <italic>BoMS1</italic> male-sterile line could be constructed in the near future using the same strategy as in maize and rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">Taken together, our results demonstrated that the tRNA-processing system is capable of targeting multiple sites of a gene or multiple genes in a single transformation event and can produce homozygous or biallelic mutations at multiple loci in the T0 generation that are inherited by the next generation. In addition, we have also produced simultaneous mutations of the allene oxide synthase gene (<italic>BoAOS)</italic> (a gene involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis) and the <italic>BoSRK3</italic> gene to develop a jasmonic acid-regulated cabbage male-sterile line using the tRNA-processing system (unpublished results).
