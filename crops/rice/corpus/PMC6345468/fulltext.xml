An estimated 55 million women become pregnant each year in malaria-endemic areas, and of these approximately 10,000 die of malaria [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Malaria infections during pregnancy are often asymptomatic, but can still cause adverse effects for both the mother and her child, including maternal anemia, impaired fetal growth, premature and still-birth, low birth weight, and congenital malaria, which have been associated with a high risk for infant mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The control and prevention of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is an important strategy to avert malaria adverse consequences and improve maternal and infant health. For areas with moderate and high malaria transmission in Africa the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a package consisting of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), use of insecticide-treated bed nets, and effective case management of clinical malaria and anemia [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IPTp-SP and bed nets are delivered during antenatal care (ANC) visits. Although many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have adopted IPTp-SP for MiP,coverage of the recommended IPTp-SP dosage (&#x02265; 3 doses) is still unacceptably low among pregnant women, despite a modest increase in ANC attendance [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], This low coverage limits the beneficial effect of IPTp-SP on maternal and child outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Quantitative data collection approaches have been widely used to explore factors affecting access and use of IPTp-SP. Factors associated with low coverage include limited access to ANC services, attitudes and practices among health care professionals, low awareness of the consequences of MiP, poor patient adherence, and community attitudes towards preventive interventions [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Quantitative studies, however, often do not capture sociocultural aspects such as sociocultural beliefs among individuals and community that may be affecting pregnant women&#x02019;s access to and use of malaria control interventions [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Countrywide policies aimed at improving maternal and neonatal health have been implemented in Mozambique. Specifically, these policies target anemia and malnutrition, prevention of MiP, increased rates of institutional deliveries, delayed age of first pregnancy, and reduced practice of unsafe abortions [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. IPTp-SP has been administered in Mozambique using the directly observed therapy approach since 2006, and insecticide-treated bed nets are distributed free of charge to pregnant women at ANC visits [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, national guidelines were recently updated to ensure the countrywide implementation of the WHO recommendation of administering at least 3 doses of IPTp-SP to pregnant women [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to data from the 2015 national survey 34.2% of pregnant women in Mozambique were receiving two doses of IPTp-SP while 22.4% were receiving three [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Data, however, from a recent study by our group in the rural Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district showed a coverage rate of 46.6% for three or more IPTp-SP doses at the time of delivery [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The current study explored perceptions, experiences, and behaviours among key informants (pregnant women and health workers) regarding malaria prevention in pregnancy (IPTp-SP) in order to identify individual and sociocultural factors that influence uptake of IPTp-SP during ANC visits. Finding from this study will provide information which could assist malaria control programs to implement appropriate strategies to improve the overall IPTp-SP coverage in the region and in the country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study site and population</title><p>The study was conducted in the health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) catchment area of the Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district, Gaza Province, Mozambique.

The HDSS routinely registers pregnancies, births, deaths, and migrations [Bonzela et al, in preparation]. There are two seasons: a hot, rainy season that runs from November to April and a cool, dry season that runs from May to October.

A dirty environment with stagnant water was also mentioned as an important cause of malaria infection as it can increase mosquito population. The study participants correctly observed that malaria infection can cause anemia and death, and perceived pregnant women and children as the groups most at risk for malaria infection and adverse consequences. However, when asked about the specific deleterious effects of MiP, very few (10.9%, 5/46) were able to mention these.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Pregnant women are the people who can contract muntzototo (malaria) very easily</italic>, <italic>I do not know how to explain this</italic>, <italic>but this is the period of conceiving another life&#x0201d;-</italic> [pregnant woman].</p></disp-quote><p>Most of the women (89.1%) were aware that malaria is preventable and recognized that the importance of keeping the house clean and using mosquito nets.

They mentioned having received "<italic>comprimidos</italic>" (Portuguese word for tablets) to refer to the three drugs given to pregnant women during ANC malaria prevention visits, although very few were able to specify which tablet. Just 10.8% named it as <italic>Fansidar</italic>, a commercial name for SP.

There were, however, also some negative experiences.

Perceptions of challenges for IPTp-SP delivery among nurses</title><p>Although (76.1%, 35/46) of pregnant women interviewed mentioned having received three white tablets at least once during ANC visits, the nurses claimed that women do not receive the recommended three or more doses of IPTp-SP during the gestational period. This was explained by the nurses in part by the fact that pregnant women delay seeking care and attend antenatal clinics for the first time during the third trimester (at 7&#x02013;8 months of gestation), thereby greatly reducing the chances of receiving three or more IPTp-SP as recommended.</p><disp-quote><p>"<italic>Women come for the first ANC visit at thirteen weeks of pregnancy and may receive up to three doses</italic>, <italic>but in most of the cases</italic>, <italic>women books first visit at eight months</italic>. <italic>These will not complete the recommended doses</italic> "-[maternal and child nurse].</p></disp-quote><p>The main barrier to the effective delivery of health services such as IPTp-SP in the opinion of the nurses interviewed was the high patient load.

Our findings support quantitative findings from the study that was undertaken in parallel to this study with regard to IPTp-SP coverage among pregnant women at delivery that reported similarly low levels of awareness and knowledge of IPTp for malaria prevention in the same area [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Although women perceived malaria as one of the main diseases affecting the local population, they did not appear to be aware of the risk and specific deleterious effects posed by MiP to both them and the fetus. This observation is consistent with reports from another study conducted in Manhi&#x000e7;a district, southern Mozambique that pregnant women were not fully aware of adverse maternal and birth outcomes associated with malaria [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The low awareness of malaria risk and its adverse consequences during pregnancy observed in this study might negatively influence adherence to IPTp-SP and general malaria prevention interventions. It also suggests the need for better strategies at ANC clinics and in the community to increase awareness about the risk and consequences of MiP and the benefits of SP and other MiP prevention strategies [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203740.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this respect, however, a closer analysis of the contents and format of the health education sessions and other sources of information in the community is necessary.</p><p>Women recognized the importance of keeping their homes clean and using mosquito nets as a means of preventing malaria. However, they failed to fully recognize the value of medicines/tablets, such as IPTp-SP for MiP prevention, supporting findings from Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results of the present study can be considered robust, as women failed to mention the main strategy for MiP prevention (IPTp-SP) not only when discussing malaria prevention approaches in general, but also were probed about SP in particular. Similar findings were reported in a systematic review of factors affecting access to and delivery and use of MiP prevention strategies in sub-Saharan Africa, in which the majority of women were found to be unaware of the use and benefits of IPTp-SP for this purpose [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Health services specifically targeting pregnant women and strategies to encourage them to attend ANC visits would appear to be essential. In addition, health promotion programmers need to ensure that women and other community members are provided with accurate information on MiP prevention measures to reinforce attitudes on IPTp-SP uptake.</p><p>Although most of the pregnant women interviewed had not heard of IPTp-SP for malaria prevention, they did remember that they had been given a drug during ANC visits. While some of them could not remember the name of the drug or were not aware that it was for preventing malaria, they were able to describe the three white tablets they had taken in front of the nurse. Previous studies in Africa have found perceptions of adverse reactions to drugs to be important determinant of treatment adherence [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, there were no indications that perceived adverse reactions had a negative influence on adherence, since none of the respondents expressed concerns over the safety of IPTp-SP.</p><p>The women interviewed recognized that health workers were &#x0201c;well-intentioned&#x0201d; during ANC visits, although they did mention some negative aspects that could be barriers to IPTp-SP delivery. Particular mention was made of the practice of giving SP tablets to pregnant women without an explanation about what the tablets were for. Other important factors mentioned by the pregnant women and nurses as potential barriers to the use of ANC services and uptake of IPTp-SP were long waiting times and absence of supporting materials such as illustrative pictures or images and pamphlets to use during health education sessions. These observations are consistent with reports from many settings in sub-Saharian Africa [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and add to the growing body of evidence calling for improvements in the quality of ANC in the study area and in Mozambique in general.</p><p>Individual barriers to adequate IPTp-SP uptake mentioned by the nurses interviewed were late and irregular ANC attendance. The impact of late and irregular attendance to ANC visits by pregnant women has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, studies in Uganda and Mali also found that late and irregular ANC attendance were important factors influencing poor uptake of IPTp-SP and other malaria prevention measures [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A better understanding of the factors that deter early ANC-seeking behaviors during pregnancy is essential for improving IPTp-SP coverage. Some studies have reported a link between late and irregular ANC attendance and cultural beliefs among pregnant women, including, for example, a reluctance to disclose their pregnancy in the early stages, particularly among adolescents, the tendency to only start attending ANC visits when the belly is visible (generally after month 5), and a tendency to only seek help when sick [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Missed opportunities have also been shown to be important barriers to adequate IPTp uptake [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although data show that the vast majority of pregnant women in the Gaza province of Mozambique attend four ANC visits [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the particularly low attendance reported by health workers in the Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district in this study is consistent with reports from the same area [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that since no SP stockouts have been observed in the Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district, it is possible that women were not always supplied with IPTp-SP during their ANC visits, as has been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Challenges for effective IPTp-SP delivery mentioned by the nurses interviewed included the high number of patients and workloads. This &#x0201c;overload&#x0201d; offers some explanation as to why women are not always given detailed information about MiP and IPTp strategies during the ANC visits. This lack of information is likely to be associated with poor uptake of MiP prevention measures in general [<xref rid="pone.0203740.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our observations in this respect suggest that adequate deployment of health staff is needed to counteract the high workload mentioned and to ensure the quality of health services provided.</p><p>Our study findings should be interpreted in light of several limitations: First, the interview with the pregnant women were held at the health facility attended by the women. Some of the women therefore may not have felt entirely comfortable with openly giving their opinions on the questions raised by the interviewer. The selection of participants also meant that we missed out on insights from pregnant women in the community who do not attend ANC visits. Finally, we did not collect data through focal group discussions, which would have enabled us to explore in greater depth experiences and beliefs concerning access to and use of IPTp-SP access among different population strata in the community. Future research, however, could explore further dimensions of factors influencing the delivery of preventive interventions for MiP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shown that access to and use of IPTp-SP in the rural Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district of Mozambique are affected by various social factors, but in particular by poor awareness of the risks and consequences of MiP and the specific benefits of IPTp-SP and delayed ANC attendance. Health system barriers such as long wait times and high patient loads resulting in insufficient time for proper counseling were also shown to negatively influence IPTp-SP uptake Intensive health education within the community and other strategies to increase awareness among women are necessary to improve the delivery of MiP prevention interventions. It is also important to ensure better communication between health service providers and ANC clients and to promote a better understanding of national ANC and IPTp policies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203740.s001"><label>S1 Form</label><caption><title>Interview guide for pregnant women.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203740.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203740.s002"><label>S2 Form</label><caption><title>Interview guide for health workers.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203740.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203740.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Factors limiting the access to IPTp intervention for malaria prevention in pregnancy.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203740.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all pregnant women and health workers who participated in this study as well as the Ch&#x000f3;kw&#x000e8; district authorities.
