    "Understanding specific biological processes involving in salt tolerance mechanisms is important for improving traits conferring tolerance to salinity, one of the most important abiotic stresses in plants. Under drought and salinity stresses, plants share overlapping responsive mechanisms such as physiological changes and activation of signaling molecules, which induce and transmit signals through regulator genes in a regulatory network. In this study, two near isogenic lines of rice carrying chromosome segments of drought tolerance QTL on chromosome 8 from IR68586-F2-CA-31 (DH103) in the genetic background of sensitive cultivar \"Khao Dawk Mali 105; KDML105\" (designated as CSSL8-94 and CSSL8-95) were used to investigate physiological responses to salt stress [namely growth, Na+/K+ ratio, water status, osmotic adjustment, photosynthetic parameters, electrolyte leakage (EL), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and sugar accumulations], compared with the standard salt tolerant (Pokkali; PK) and their recurrent parent (KDML105) rice cultivars. Physiological examination indicated that both CSSLs showed superior salt-tolerant level to KDML105. Our results suggested that salt tolerance ability of these CSSL lines may be resulted from high performance photosynthesis, better osmotic adjustment, and less oxidative stress damage under salt conditions. Moreover, to explore new candidate genes that might take part in salt tolerance mechanisms, we performed co-expression network analysis for genes identified in the CSSL rice, and found that Os08g419090, the gene involved with tetrapyrrole and porphyrin biosynthetic process (chlorophyll biosynthetic process), Os08g43230 and Os08g43440 (encoded TraB family protein and cytochrome P450, respectively) might have unprecedented roles in salt stress tolerance."
