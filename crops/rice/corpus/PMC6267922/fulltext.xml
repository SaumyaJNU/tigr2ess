Methylated cytosine (mCs) plays an important role in gene regulation in order to control growth and developmental processes in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Methylation of genome affects morphology, stability, differentiation, regulation of gene expression, transposable elements (TEs) transposition, chromatin structural stability, and protection of genome from invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In general, DNA methylation can be stably inherited to trans-generations by mitotic cell division and considered as a heritable epigenetic mark in plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Methylated cytosine in plants comprised of three sequence contexts: symmetric (CG and CHG) and asymmetric (CHH) methylation depending on the composition of base (where, H refers to A/T/C). Methylation at CG sequence context is the major type of cytosine methylation, as it is widely distributed not only in heterochromatic (such as TEs and repeat sequences) but also in eu-chromatic regions of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Methylation is believed to be primarily catalyzed by a specific families of DNA METHYLTRANSFERASES; MET1 (homologous to animal DNMT1) for CG, plant-specific CHROMOMETHYLTRANSFERASE (CMT3 and CMT2) for CHG, and DRM2 (homologous to animal DNMT3) for CHH sequence context. CMT2 is also found to be involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation in CHH sequence context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">BS-seq (Bisulfite sequencing) is a gold-standard method to study DNA methylation, which can provide a genome-wide methylome analysis at single-base resolution in model plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] used BS-seq to measure DNA methylation in castor bean seeds. They found CHH methylation sequence context was substantially higher in endosperm and embryo than previously known tissues of plants. Compared with embryo, the endosperm exhibited a significant reduction in CG and CHG sequence contexts and non significant reduction in CHH sequence context methylation. Feng et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. compared DNA methylation patterns in eight diverse species of plants and animals, and established TEs and repeat sequences revealed a high degree of methylation, with the highest and lowest degree of methylation in CG and CHH sequence context, respectively. Genomic DNA mostly covers CG sequence context methylation, that emphases on exons rather than introns. CHH sequence context methylation is more widely distributed in monocot genome (e.g. rice) possibly due to massive distribution of repeated sequences. Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that repeated sequences and TEs had high levels of CHG sequence context methylation and implied role of DNA methylation in evolution. Hisataka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed that there are many TEs and repeated sequences in rice genome and changes in CG and CHG sequence context methylation were not directly associated to gene function in rice.</p><p id="Par12">Polyploidy or WGD is fundamental state of plants to ensure diversification under unfavorable environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Following genome doubling, a specie undergoes a process of &#x0201c;diploidization&#x0201d; and evolves into new a contemporary diploid specie. Although, a large number of repeated genes are lost during diploidization, but still plant genome contains a large fraction of repeated genes; for example, these repeated sequences account for 25% of the genes in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], 30% in poplar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], 50% in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and 67% in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] recently graphed the fate of repeated genes in nearly 40 different flowering species and found that most of the genes that had undergone one or more WGD events were quickly restored back to single copy state. However, yet some of genes were remained duplicated. Most of those genes belong to gene family that produces accustomed responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In rice, changes in the patterns and levels of gene methylation caused expression differences. These differences depend on the mode of duplication; the direction (positive or negative) of correlation and K<sub>s</sub> (synonymous amino acid substitution rate) of WGD vs. single gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In soybean, WGD of genes that have more methylation in CG sequence context showed higher expression levels and were more likely to be retained as repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In cassava, a strong positive correlation between DNA methylation and expression of repeated genes was found during WGD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Previous studies have revealed that occurrence of many polyploids was caused due to external stimuli, such as pressure and environmental fluctuations or the type of reproductive system that ultimately lead to the formation of un-reduced gametes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Polyploids can overcome the fluctuations, as their genomic background is more malleable; therefore, polyploids have better potential and rapid adaption under diverse environment than that of diploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although, in a stable environment, the extinction risk for polyploids is higher than that of diploids; thus, only challenging environments can increase environmental stability and specific adaptability of polyploids by chromosome rearrangement and thereby reduces the risk of extinction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Kagale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] showed that at-least eight WGDs occurred in Cruciferae species that corresponds to five independent polyploidization events. This correlation between WGD and diversification of species demonstrated that environment played an important role in occurrence of WGD.</p><p id="Par14">Earlier studies have focused in the variation of DNA methylation caused by polyploidization of allopolyploids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], while autopolyploid methylome analysis also clearly distinguished the epigenetic variation in TEs and gene expression induced by genomic doubling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

Previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] established that CHG and CHH sequence context methylation levels in TEs of tetraploid rice were generally elevated. Here, our study found that methylation rate in CG sequence context of promoter regions was highest, and not affected by different ploidy level. Our results are suggesting firstly, demonstrated that the high CG methylation did reduce gene expression change suggesting that DNA methylation exert repressive function and ensure genome stability during WGD. Secondly, ploidy changes in promoter region had a large impact on methylation of CHH and CHG sequence context, especially an obvious effect on CHH sequence contexts. We suspect it could be due to higher methylation rate (317, 65.23%) in CHH sequence context which is much higher than that of CHG sequence context (120, 24.69%). Likewise, stability of CHH methylation was also lower than that of CHG sequence context. Our results validate the findings of Feng et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] that reported the CHH sequence context methylation is more widely distributed in rice genome. It is known that decrease in METI and (DDMI) are necessary to maintain the methylation in CG sequence context, while CMT3 mainly maintains cytosine methylation in CHG and CHH sequence context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] demonstrated that <italic>oscmt3a</italic> could decrease CHG sequence context methylation significantly and thereby changes the expression of some genes. Therefore, we suspect that ploidy changes regulate the enzyme activities of METI, DDMI, and CMT3 by changing the specific (or preferred) methylation patterns in CG/CHG/CHH sequence contexts, which in turn regulates the expression levels some genes. Yet verification of this hypothesis still needs further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression in haploid, diploid, and triploid</title><p id="Par33">The intergenic regions of genome are highly methylated that generally contains TEs and repeated sequences, but methylation of promoter and intragenic regions has also an important influence on gene expression. Numerous studies have shown that DNA methylation in these two regions can also affect transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].

(2) In triploids, the average transcription level of methylated genes is only higher in promoter region than that of intragenic region, that are consistent with the second hypothesis. (3) In haploid, average transcription level of genes without methylation, were found highest and the gene expression level was slightly lowered, when methylation occurs in promoter region or the intragenic region.

Investigators speculated, similar expression levels were due to variation in DNA methylation levels of TEs induced by polyploidy impact to genome that restricted expression of surrounding genes. The maintenance of expression level is conducive to buffer the effect of immediate multiplication of genome as cell environment machinery cannot rapidly increase to process loftier expression.</p><p id="Par36">In generally, we think that DNA methylation is not the only mark affecting gene expression in rice seedlings of different ploidy, based on the unclear relationship between gene transcription and DNA methylation in different gene regions. Epigenetic modifications, including smRNA regulation, histone modification, and environmental variations can modulate gene expression in coordination with DNA methylation. During polyploidization of plants, DNA homogeneity and chromosome rearrangement should also be considered in modification of genome in addition to epigenetic modification, which has an important effect on genome evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">SARII-628 produces twin seedlings of different ploidy and we compared the level of methylation and mRNA expression in three different (CG, CHG, and CHH) sequence contexts of promoter region among haploid (1X), diploid (2X), and triploid (3X).
