The sanitization effect of LAF on fecal sludge (FS) was conducted in triplicate. This study used three materials, namely, lactobacillus of lactic acid bacteria, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, which were known to enhance the production of lactic acid. Each material was mixed in three different reactors at equal ratio with raw FS (i.e., 1:1&#x0202f;v/w, w/w, and w/w). The pH decline rate, lactic acid production rate, and fecal coliform suppression degree were monitored over the period of the treatment process as parameters to evaluate the efficiency of various LAF for pathogen inactivation in FS. Results showed that only fermented rice flour was able to completely inactivate the indicator organism (fecal <italic>coliform</italic>) at the end of fermentation. Final plate counts of 8.6&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/100&#x0202f;mL, 2.4&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/100&#x0202f;mL, and zero (0) were achieved from lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour treatment processes, respectively. The final pH from the reactors that contained lactobacillus and FS, cassava flour and FS, and fermented rice flour and FS were 5.5, 8, and 3.9, respectively. This study revealed that not all LAF materials can effectively suppress pathogens in FS. The results serve as the foundation in developing an effective, cheap, and easy to use LAF on FS pretreatment for pathogen inactivation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0025" position="anchor"><alt-text id="at0035">fx1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour and fermented rice flour were used to produce lactic acid for pathogens inactivation in fecal sludge.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Fecal coliforms were completely inactivated within 3 weeks of rice flour fermentation with fecal sludge.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">No significant decline in fecal coliform during lactobacillus and fermented cassava fermentation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Fecal pH was permanently reduced during fermentation with rice flour.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fecal sludge</kwd><kwd>Fecal coliform</kwd><kwd>Lactic acid fermentation</kwd><kwd>Lactobacillus</kwd><kwd>Fermented cassava flour</kwd><kwd>Fermented rice flour</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">Adequate facilities for the safe treatment or disposal of fecal sludge (FS) should be established globally. FS causes several harmful diseases if not properly managed (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">al-Ghazali and al-Azawi, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bracken and Ysunza, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>). Approximately 2.5 billion people globally do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2012</xref>), and more than 0.7 billion people globally lacked access to clean water because the water is polluted by people's own feces (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2012</xref>). A study revealed that about 1800 children die every day due to diseases associated with inadequate hygiene, lack of sanitation, and contaminated water (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">UNICEF, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">To address these issues, the millennium development goal (MDG) target aimed to reduce the 2.5 billion people without adequate sanitation in half by 2015. Unfortunately, this target was not feasible at the end of 2015. Considering that the world's population is expected to reach 9.6 billion in 2050, a suitable method for dealing with FS, especially on the processes that enable the sustainable and efficient recovery of resources, should be developed (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">UN, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Yemaneh, 2015</xref>). In the past few years, dry and low water sanitation has gained worldwide attention with the concept that FS can be directly processed at the point of recovery or collected and transported to the point of treatment (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Mackie Jensen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Verbyla et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Yemaneh et al., 2012</xref>).

Lactic acid fermentation (LAF) has been reported to successfully suppressed pathogens in FS and organic material preservation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2015b</xref>). LAF is a metabolic process in which lactic acid fermenting organisms (LAB) easily metabolize degradable carbohydrates to lactic acid. LAB have the capability to convert carbohydrates to lactic acid, and the genera <italic>Leuconostic</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> are used for food preservation by fermentation industries and sanitation agencies (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbergh, 1993</xref>). The reduction of pH during lactic acid fermentation and the production of antimicrobial compounds are effective natural and cheap processes to effectively eliminate non-desirable microorganisms and pathogens when applied for hygienization (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Noike et al., 2002</xref>). Lactic acid reduces the bulk pH of the surrounding medium that influences the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and exo-enzymes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2015b</xref>). In addition, the capability of lactic acid to suppress pathogens is partially attributed to its capability to penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms in the associated form, which results in the decline on intracellular pH of pathogens. <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2006)</xref> reported that the survival of pathogens pH was reduced at pH less than 3.5 although the suppression of bacteria requires a pH of less than 2.5. Therefore, the key antimicrobial property of lactic acid is the capability to suppress the intracellular of bacteria (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2015b</xref>). <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Scheinemann et al.

In addition, no concrete studies have been conducted to compare the efficiency of LAF of FS. An experiment was conducted in this study to compare the LAF treatment efficiency of FS with LAF materials, namely, lactobacillus strain of LAB, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour. The results served as the foundation for the research on producing effective, cheap and easy to use LAF for safe application or disposal of FS hygienization.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and method</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Origin of fecal sludge and experimental set-up</title><p id="p0045">FS was collected from the septic tank of the University of Science and Technology, Beijing.

All the three fermentations lasted for 6 d. The initial volume of lactobacillus used was 40&#x0202f;mL, cultured every 24&#x0202f;h, and was enlarged to the required volume of 1&#x0202f;L with the addition of deionized water for the period of 6 d at room temperature for the LAB to grow to a large quantity before mixing with FS for the treatment process. For the fermentation in cassava flour, dry cassava flour was soaked with deionized water and was allowed to ferment for a period of 6 d. The main stages involved in the lactic acid production from fermented rice flour included steaming, soaking, extruding, boiling, cooling, and fermenting. Soaking is important for the production of fermented rice flour because it increases the water content of rice and enhances natural fermentation. pH values of 4.2, 3.8, and 3.4 were achieved from <italic>lactobacillus</italic>, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour on the 6th day of fermentation. <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the LAF process of lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cultivated lactobacillus, fermented cassava flour and fermented rice flour.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><sec id="s0025"><label>3.1</label><title>Analytical method</title><p id="p0055">The total solid content of initial FS and after treatment were assessed using the 2540E standard method for wastewater examination.

This study revealed that a single strain of LAB cannot effectively suppress pH variation in FS. The acidity of FS influences the rate of change in pH, which determines the amount of lactic acid present in fermentation and the effective sanitization. Thiamann (1963) stated that for lactic acid fermentation to be effective in sanitization, a final pH of approximately 4.0 should be achieved. However, this study showed that effective sanitation process depended on the initial low pH value of lactic acid and the survival rate of LAB when added to FS.

This finding may be due to the lack of supplement sugar source to keep the produced LAB active during the treatment process. <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kamra and Srivastava (1994)</xref> reported that the application of LAF for fermentable substances requires sugar supplements.

The total elimination of fecal <italic>coliform</italic> in this process may be attributed to the low pH value achieved from the process because a previous study reported that LAF process that achieved a final pH value of 3.5&#x02013;4.2 efficiently eliminated a range of pathogens. The final pH achieved in the fermentation with rice flour was within 3.7&#x02013;3.9. Apart from the stable reduction in pH, other factors may have played a vital role in fermented rice flour that contributed in eliminating bacteria pathogens in the FS. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2015)</xref> reported that fermented rice flour produces abundant LAB and yeast. This condition may contribute in suppressing bacteria pathogens in FS. However, other antimicrobial compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, and bacteriocins are reported to be produced by LAB during fermentation, which also play important roles on pathogen elimination in the fermentation system (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Mackie Jensen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Verbyla et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Yemaneh et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>7</label><title>Hygienization of bacteria pathogen</title><p id="p0095">Considering that LAB in fermented rice flour remained active throughout the experiment, the hygienization method showed more effectiveness than fermented cassava flour and <italic>lactobacillus</italic> bacteria because fecal <italic>coliform</italic> was reduced to half compared with the control reactor within one week and were completely inactivated within two weeks. The final plate count from the treatment processes is presented in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>.

This method conserved the nutrients during the processing of FS effectively due to the absence of self-heating technique and the minimal production of gas. Food supply through agriculture should be improved by using sanitized FS as soil conditioner in the growing global population. However, the direct use of lacto-fermented feces to agriculture may be constrained by high concentrations of organic acids, insufficient hygienization, and incomplete decomposition. Post-treatment by vermin-composting, thermophilic composting and the addition of biochar stabilize and sanitize the material before its application in agriculture.<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Fecal coliform plate count after final treatment (A= Treatment with lactobacillus, B= Treatment with fermented cassava flour, C= Treatment with rice flour), the plates on the left in each picture show control plates, while the plates on the right show treatment plates.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>8</label><title>Odor evaluation</title><p id="p0100">Odor evaluation by panel of observers indicates that the fecal odor is not suppressed from the treatment process and the control for experiments with <italic>lactobacillus</italic> and FS.

For the treatment with the combination of fermented rice flour with FS (1:1&#x0202f;W/W), the fecal odor is suppressed and is replaced by sour smell. From the results of different monitored processes for LAF experiments of <italic>lactobacillus</italic>, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, the LAF of rice flour indicates better odor suppression efficiency compared with other LAF sources used in the study. Therefore, fermented rice flour played an important role in odor control for effective LAF of FS.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>9</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0105">In this study, the treatment efficiency of LAF processes for pathogen inactivation in FS was conducted among LAB potential materials, namely, <italic>lactobacillus</italic>, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour. The results showed that only fermented rice flour effectively inactivated the indicator organism (fecal coliform). The final pH values of 5.4, 7.8, and 3.9 were achieved from <italic>lactobacillus</italic>, fermented cassava flour, and fermented rice flour, respectively. The results indicated that acidification during fermentation played a vital role in pathogen elimination, because only rice flour was able to reduce the pH of the process toward acidification state. This study revealed that not all LAF materials had sufficient native lactic acid fermenting microorganisms that can effectively suppress bacteria pathogens in FS and several LAB potential materials required additives, such as sugar, to keep the process active. Therefore, proper pretreatment test should be conducted to select a suitable method for LAF on the effective acidification of FS for pathogen elimination.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>al-Ghazali</surname><given-names>M.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>al-Azawi</surname><given-names>S.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Listeria monocytogenes contamination of crops grown on soil treated with sewage sludge cake</article-title><source>J.
