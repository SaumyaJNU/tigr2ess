In reality, despite the visible benefits of many of the new agricultural technologies, including machinery and management practices, farmers either do not adopt them or it takes a long time to begin the adoption process and scaling up. To enhance the provision of irrigation using surface water and to enhance irrigation efficiency, Bangladesh has been trying to introduce the axial-flow-pump (AFP) appropriate for surface water irrigation, which can lift up to 55% more water, conditional on the water head, than a conventional centrifugal pump. Despite the visible benefits of the AFP, the uptake of the AFP for irrigation is low in the targeted zone of Bangladesh. The present study demonstrates that the new technology must be modified to adapt to local demand and specifications. Most importantly, the price of the new technology must be competitive with the prices of the existing available substitute technologies to ensure a rapid uptake and scaling up of this new agricultural technology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Technology adoption is core of agricultural development.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Despite visible benefits many technologies are not adopted by farmers.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">The study used primary data to examine why this can be the case.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The study shows that technology must be compatible to local environment.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Price of new technology must be competitive to the alternatives.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adoption</kwd><kwd>Axial-flow-pump</kwd><kwd>Centrifugal pump</kwd><kwd>Farmer</kwd><kwd>Irrigation</kwd><kwd>Low-lift-pump</kwd><kwd>Technology</kwd><kwd>Perception</kwd><kwd>Price</kwd><kwd>Society</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Nearly 11% of the 7.42 billion world population is extremely poor. They are concentrated mostly in the rural areas of Southern Asia and sub-Saharan African countries, 78% of whom rely on agriculture for their livelihoods [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As the majority of the rural poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, agricultural growth can have paramount impacts on rural poverty alleviation. In fact, agricultural GDP growth is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as GDP growth in other sectors [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It means if a 1% increase in GDP in any non-farm sector can lead to a reduction of poverty by 1%, the poverty reduction will be 2% with 1% growth in the agricultural GDP [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because of its profound impacts on poverty alleviation, ensuring agricultural growth is the center of the development policies, particularly in poverty-stricken agrarian developing countries.</p><p id="p0040">However, the sustainable growth of the agricultural sector critically depends on the adoption of improved, scale-appropriate and eco-friendly technologies, including new disease-resistant and climate-adjusted seeds, modern management practices, and conservation of resources using scale-appropriate new agricultural machinery. The adoption of new technology in agriculture is, therefore, at the core of agricultural growth and, thus, rural poverty alleviation. Unfortunately, the adoption of new agricultural technology, including agricultural machinery, is seldom rapid [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as a large number of factors can affect the adoption process [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. This is because, new agricultural technologies are often correlated with risks and uncertainties about proper application, scale appropriateness and suitability with the prevailing environment, and importantly with farmers' perceptions and expectations [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Examining farmers' perceptions of a new agricultural technology is, therefore, critically important to ensure the adoption and scaling up of the technologies, thereby, ensuring sustainable growth and development of the agriculture sector.</p><p id="p0045">Using primary data collected from 70 sampled irrigation service providers in Bangladesh, who were given an axial-flow-pump (AFP) for free for a season under a demonstration program, and by examining the users' perceptions, the present study demonstrates the need for continuous modification of a new technology based on the requirements of the farmers. Modifications should be done at least in the initial stage of the development and deployment of a technology for the rapid adoption of a new agricultural technology. It can minimize the gap between the actual and the expected performance of a new agricultural technology, which in turn can critically influence the adoption and diffusion of that new technology. In addition, the price of a new technology must be competitive with alternative competing available technology.</p><p id="p0050">The case is worth investigating for several reasons. The physical size of Bangladesh (147,570&#x0202f;km<sup>2</sup>) is almost equivalent to the US state of Georgia, yet the population of Bangladesh (158.9 million) at present is almost half of the entire US population [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Yet, Bangladesh is one of the few countries that has achieved rice production self-sufficiency. In the early 1970s, with a population of less than 70 million, the country faced massive food shortages and famine [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 1970, the total cereal production in Bangladesh (rice, wheat and maize) was 16.8 million tons, which increased to 56.4 million tons by 2016 [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consequently, currently with a population of nearly 160 million, the country is almost self-sufficient in food production. In 2016, with a production of 52.6 million tons of only paddy rice, Bangladesh ranked as the fourth largest paddy-rice-producing country in the world, after China, India and Indonesia [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">The remarkable success in cereal production, and particularly in paddy production, thereby achieving rice-food production self-sufficiency, is mainly attributed to the rapid adoption of modern high-yielding varieties (HYV) along with the expansion of the ground-water-based, private-led, small-scale shallow tube well-based irrigation system [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the massive extraction of groundwater for irrigation in the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) including Bangladesh has substantially reduced the groundwater table in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite recurrent floods in Bangladesh, the ground-water level in the northwest and southwest regions has been declining by between 0.01 and 0.05&#x0202f;m/year [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Considering the consequences of rapidly-depleting ground-water reserves on sustainable development in the future, some studies considered the phenomenon as a major policy failure [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alarmingly, in addition to the problem of the declining ground water, global climate change can also generate severe threats on sustainable agriculture in the entire IGP &#x02013; the most densely-populated and intensively-cultivated region in the world. In the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, it is estimated that the irrigation water demand will increase by 10% at the lowest for a 1&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C increase in temperature [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As an enhancement of irrigation effectiveness can reduce water requirements by nearly 50% [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the expansion of the directly-renewable surface water-based irrigation system can be an effective remedy to the problems related to over extraction of ground water in the entire IGP including Bangladesh. In this case, the deployment of hydraulically efficient AFPs in suitable cases can be instrumental in expanding surface water-based irrigation systems.</p><p id="p0060">Second, in Bangladesh, farmers generally use centrifugal pumps for irrigation. A number of carefully-controlled scientific experiments by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and its national partners in Bangladesh confirm that an AFP can lift from 28% to 55% more water conditional on the water head [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The closer the water head, the more efficient is the AFP [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A rapid adoption of AFPs in suitable cases, and AFP replacement of centrifugal pumps, where suitable, therefore, can reduce the costs of production of <italic>boro</italic> rice. The rice production costs in Bangladesh have been spiraling over the years [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Currently, the <italic>boro</italic> rice cultivation cost in Bangladesh is USD1319/ha, of which irrigation cost is 13.4% (USD178/ha) of the total cost [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As the benefit-cost ratio of cultivation of <italic>boro</italic> rice is 0.82 [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a reduction in the irrigation costs due to a potentially rapid adoption of AFP in suitable areas can significantly improve the current benefit-cost situation in <italic>boro</italic> rice cultivation in the targeted regions.</p><p id="p0065">Under the initiative of CIMMYT, Bangladesh, from 2012 to 13, AFPs were made available in the southern region of Bangladesh for farmers' purchase. However, from October 2013 to September 2017, so far only 888 AFPs have been purchased by the lead farmers, who also provide irrigation services to other client farmers, in the southern region of Bangladesh, and the current land coverage using AFPs is 19,287&#x0202f;ha [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Currently in Bangladesh, there are 173.2 thousand surface water-based low-lift pumps (LLPs), 1417 thousand ground-water-based shallow-tube wells and nearly 37 thousand deep tube wells are engaged in irrigating 5.31 million hectares of land [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The LLPs irrigate 1.16 million hectares of land, which is nearly 22% of the total irrigated land in Bangladesh [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The largest number of LLPs are deployed in Chattogram Division (41,514), Sylhet Division (41,384), Khulna Division (32,741), Dhaka Division (20,581) and in Barishal Division (14,459) [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Currently, out of a total of 173,179 low-lift pumps in Bangladesh, 163,764 were diesel engine-based and 9415 were electric motor-based irrigation pumps [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, a replacement of the less-efficient diesel engine-based centrifugal pumps with the more efficient AFPs can improve Bangladesh's terms of trade by reducing diesel imports, because the water-lifting capacity of an AFP is high and, consequently, the required operation time for an irrigation machine with an AFP will be less than before. Consequently the total diesel demand will be lower than before. A replacement of the diesel engine-based centrifugal pumps by AFPs can also generate positive environmental externalities by reducing emissions from the existing diesel engine-based LLPs.</p><p id="p0070">Finally, the government of Bangladesh has developed and approved a master plan for agricultural development in the southern region for agricultural intensification by expanding surface water irrigation facilities [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Note that while the average cropping intensity of Bangladesh is 194 (i.e. a piece of land is cultivated at least 1.94 times a year), the cropping intensity in the southern region of Bangladesh (Barishal, Khulna and Patuakhali) ranges between 146 and 187 [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Because of the current vulnerability and potential of the southwest region, the government of the United States of America has announced a special program called Feed the Future, which is initiatives to improve the livelihoods of the poor by improving the agricultural sector [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In Barishal and Khulna divisions, and in Chattogram and Dhaka divisions, a sizeable amount of land is kept fallow partly due to the high establishment and operation costs for irrigation [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A rapid diffusion of the AFP, particularly in the southern region targeting bringing suitable fallow land under cultivation in the dry season by irrigating using AFPs, can be an efficient strategy in implementing the agricultural master plan of the government of Bangladesh.</p><p id="p0075">The present study explores the factors that affect the adoption of AFPs in Bangladesh and the estimates of the expected price of an AFP. The rest of the study is organized as follows: Section <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> includes the materials and methods and elaborates the data collection process; Section <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> specifies the econometric estimation process; Section <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> presents the major findings and Section 5 presents the conclusions and policy implications.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods: study design, study area and sampling</title><p id="p0080">The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Bangladesh, under the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia &#x02013; Mechanization and Irrigation (CSISA-MI) project, introduced AFPs in Bangladesh through imports from other Asian countries. Although the use of AFPs in Asia started in the 1970s, first in the Mekong delta of Vietnam [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the AFP is a completely new technology in Bangladesh. Under a joint venture agreement with a local Bangladeshi private business organization, Rangpur Foundry Limited (RFL), and in collaboration with an international NGO, iDE (International Development Enterprise), Bangladesh, CIMMYT, Bangladesh imported and tested the performance of AFPs. A carefully-controlled scientific experiment shows that the hydraulic performance of an AFP is higher at low lift, which ranged from 28% higher at 3-m water heads to 55% higher at 2-m water heads [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In general, the nearer the water head, the more efficient is an AFP. The efficiency of an AFP is also influenced by the slope of an AFP: a more parallel setting of a pump provides more water lifting efficiency.</p><p id="p0085">To introduce this highly-efficient irrigation pump to farmers, CIMMYT, Bangladesh organized a number of AFP-based irrigation demonstrations in the southern part of Bangladesh. Under the program, AFPs were provided for free for a season to a selected number of irrigation service providers, who were using centrifugal pumps. In addition, mechanical and technical supports and fuel subsidies were provided during demonstrations to the service providers who were selected for using AFPs under the demonstration program, keeping their centrifugal pumps idle for a season.</p><p id="p0090">The major objectives of AFP deployment and demonstrations were to generate awareness among the irrigation service providers and to understand the perception of the service providers on AFPs, compared to the centrifugal pumps that the service providers had been using. Under the program, each selected service provider was provided with an AFP. The ultimate objective of the AFP demonstration program was to encourage irrigation service-provider farmers' to purchase AFPs. In the series of demonstrations in 2014&#x02013;15, CIMMYT, Bangladesh deployed 68 AFPs in Barishal, Bhola, Barguna, Jhalokati, Patuakhali and Pirojpur districts in Barishal Division, two in Faridpur and Rajbari districts in Dhaka Division and 13 in Narail, Khulna and Satkhira districts of Khulna Division. In Barishal and Dhaka divisions, service providers used AFPs mainly for irrigating <italic>boro</italic> rice. In contrast, AFPs in Khulna Division were mainly used for water conveyance between/among hatcheries and ponds or aquaculture (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Panel (a) an axial flow pump in operation; Panel (b) inside an axial flow pump; Panel (c) a low-lift pump.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0095">At the end of the <italic>boro</italic> season in June 2015, using a standard questionnaire, the perceptions of service providers, including their willingness to purchase an AFP, were collected. As the use of AFPs in the Khulna regions was other than for crop irrigation, in this study, we have not included the perception of the AFP users in Khulna Division. The present study relies on information collected from 70 irrigation service providers located in Barishal, Bhola, Barguna, Jhalokati, Patuakhali and Pirojpur districts of Barishal Division, and Faridpur and Rajbari districts of Dhaka Division (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the perception analysis process, the sampled service providers were asked to rank a number of attributes of an AFP compared to the centrifugal pump. For an attribute with the lowest level of satisfaction, service providers ranked a 1; for the highest level of satisfaction, they ranked a 4. The comparison of each attribute between an AFP and the centrifugal pump revealed by a sampled user was then tested applying a two sampled mean test-the <italic>t</italic>-test.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Location of the sampled irrigation service providers using AFPs in the sampled eight districts of Bangladesh.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0025">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0100">In addition to a simple two-by-two table revealing the price of the AFP that the users were willing pay, applying a two-part estimation method, we also estimated the expected price of an AFP that an AFP user offered. The application of a two-part model estimation procedure is suggested to examine the factors that affect the decision to purchase and the price to be offered for AFP by an irrigation service provider, as it permits the censoring mechanism for the irrigation service providers for whom the demand is 0, and the price function can be estimated in a separate process. More clearly, the two-part model is a special type of mixture model, in which the zero and non-zero values (price of an AFP that the users offered, in this case) will generate different separate density functions. Particularly, for the irrigation service providers who were not willing to purchase an AFP, zeros are generally handled by developing a model only for the probability of positive outcome as follows:<disp-formula id="fd1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02205;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>Pr</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mtext>|</mml:mtext><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mi>&#x003b4;</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where Z is a vector of variables that includes all explanatory variables, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2" altimg="si2.gif" overflow="scroll"><mml:mi>&#x003b4;</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the related vectors of parameters, which are to be estimated and <italic>F</italic> is the cumulative distribution function of the error term which is indepdently and identically distributed.

In the initial years, to boost the adoption of AFPs, a subsidy of Bangladesh taka<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> (BDT) 8000 was provided per AFP through the sales agents. The subsidy was independent of length and the discharge diameter. The actual prices of AFPs are, therefore, BDT 8000 plus the prices shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The long AFP with the wider discharge diameter was in high demand, as it can better serve <italic>boro</italic> rice irrigation that requires more water than any other winter crop in Bangladesh. The lowest priced AFP used for demonstration was 20 feet long with a four-inch discharge diameter, the price of which was BDT 9700 excluding the subsidy.

Therefore, for an AFP, it is possible to save some labor cost as there is no need of priming, what is ranked as a most positive attribute of an AFP by the users (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Ranking by the sampled service providers on the selected attributes of an AFP and centrifugal pump (1&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;not satisfied at all, 4&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;maximum satisfaction).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0045">Table 3</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3">Attributes of the machine</th><th colspan="2" rowspan="2">All sampled service provider<hr/></th><th colspan="4">Ranking on attributes based on whether or not will purchase an AFP<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">On AFP<hr/></th><th colspan="2">On centrifugal pump<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>AFP</th><th>Centrifugal pump</th><th>Yes</th><th>No</th><th>Yes</th><th>No</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Water lifting</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.51)</td><td align="left">2.29 (0.80)</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.47)</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.6)</td><td align="left">2.3 (0.85)</td><td align="left">2.3 (0.62)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Fuel saving</td><td align="left">3.5 (0.70)</td><td align="left">2.14 (0.71)</td><td align="left">3.5 (0.69)</td><td align="left">3.4 (0.74)</td><td align="left">2.1 (0.73)</td><td align="left">2.1 (0.64)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Labor saving</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.58)</td><td align="left">1.80 (0.71)</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.49)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.82)</td><td align="left">1.7 (0.73)</td><td align="left">2.0 (0.65)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Priming</td><td align="left">3.9 (0.26)</td><td align="left">1.56 (0.83)</td><td align="left">3.9 (0.19)</td><td align="left">3.8 (0.41)</td><td align="left">1.5 (0.86)</td><td align="left">1.6 (0.74)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Availability of spare parts</td><td align="left">3.2 (1.08)</td><td align="left">3.09 (1.06)</td><td align="left">3.22 (1.10)</td><td align="left">3.2 (1.01)</td><td align="left">3.0 (1.08)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.98)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Availability of mechanical service</td><td align="left">3.2 (1.09)</td><td align="left">3.13 (1.02)</td><td align="left">3.3 (1.12)</td><td align="left">2.9 (0.96)</td><td align="left">3.1 (1.02)</td><td align="left">3.3 (1.03)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Engine cooling system</td><td align="left">3.0 (1.01)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.89)</td><td align="left">3.1 (1.02)</td><td align="left">2.9 (1.03)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.95)</td><td align="left">3.4 (0.63)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Easiness to operate</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.54)</td><td align="left">2.73 (0.98)</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.46)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.72)</td><td align="left">2.7 (1.02)</td><td align="left">2.7 (0.82)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Setting with engine and machine</td><td align="left">3.2 (0.94)</td><td align="left">3.2 (1.0)</td><td align="left">3.3 (0.94)</td><td align="left">2.8 (0.86)</td><td align="left">3.2 (1.0)</td><td align="left">3.3 (1.03)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mobility of the machine</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.66)</td><td align="left">2.43 (0.89)</td><td align="left">3.6 (0.71)</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.46)</td><td align="left">2.4 (0.93)</td><td align="left">2.5 (0.74)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Overall satisfaction level</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.50)</td><td align="left">2.4 (0.79)</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.51)</td><td align="left">3.7 (0.49)</td><td align="left">2.3 (0.78)</td><td align="left">2.5 (0.83)</td></tr></tbody></table><attrib>Source: Survey, 2015.</attrib></table-wrap></p><p id="p0200">In terms of the availability of spare parts, and mechanical services, the sampled irrigation service providers almost equally ranked both the AFPs and centrifugal pumps. However, in the case of the engine cooling attributes, the sampled service providers ranked the centrifugal pump higher than the AFP. In Bangladesh, in many cases, irrigation service providers make a direct water line to cool down the engine attached to the pump. The facility can be more easily generated for a centrifugal pump than for an AFP. For an AFP, to generate a direct water line to cool the engine, it is necessary to make a perfect mechanical hole with the provision of a water pipe. It requires mechanical and technical skills. The respondents ranked equally the machine and engine setting attributes of an AFP and a centrifugal pump. Currently, an AFP does not have a built-in chassis. Therefore, it is somehow problematic to connect an AFP to an engine, and an imperfect setting can lead to a repeated loss in belts that connect the engine to an AFP. In contrast, almost all centrifugal pumps are set with the engine on the same chassis and are thereby easy to operate. Finally, overall the sampled service providers were more satisfied with the overall performance of the AFPs compared to the centrifugal pumps.</p><p id="p0205">During our survey, we asked the service providers whether or not they realized a reduction in fuel and labor costs, and 93% of the respondents realized a reduction in fuel cost and 90% reported a reduction in labor cost. The study revealed that, on average, compared to a centrifugal pump, using an AFP can save BDT913/ha due to a reduction in fuel requirements, and BDT457/ha due to a reduction in labor requirement primarily related to priming (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Currently, there are 173,179 units of low lift pumps (surface water irrigation pumps) in Bangladesh in operation, which irrigate 1,164,603&#x0202f;ha of land [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on the findings (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), even if it is possible to irrigate only 10% of 1,1646,03&#x0202f;ha of land using AFPs by replacing the relatively less-efficient centrifugal pumps, simple calculations show that it is possible to save BDT159.5 million (approximately USD1.92 million) through a reduction in diesel and labor demands in a single season.<table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Reported reduction in fuel and wage costs from using an AFP for irrigation.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0050">Table 4</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristics</th><th>Average of all sampled respondents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">% Reported reduced fuel cost</td><td align="left">92.9 (25.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Actual value of fuel saved (BDT)</td><td align="left">913.5 (964.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% Reported reduced labor costs related to priming</td><td align="left">90.0 (30.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Actual value of saved labor costs (BDT)</td><td align="left">457.2 (809.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Source: Survey, 2015.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="p0210">We asked the respondents about the attributes that are required to adjust or re-set to make the AFP user-friendly to the irrigation service providers in Bangladesh. They said that the AFP should come with a generic chassis which will be compatible with existing popular engines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Of the sampled service providers, 17% suggested increasing the thickness of the pipe of the AFPs to increase the longevity by reducing the chance of denting and/or breaking the machine. After using the AFP, these service providers also mentioned that quality material for the bearings, pulley and shaft of the machine be ensured and suggested that no leakage of water from the oil cell should occur. Spilling water through the oil cell can easily damage the bearings of AFPs. Currently, the available AFPs in Bangladesh are directly imported from abroad. Suggestions of the sampled service providers indicate the need to develop and expand the local manufacturing and assembling capacity of AFPs in Bangladesh to better fit with the local demand (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Suggestions for improving the AFP.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0215">During our survey we informally asked the sampled respondents what the major constraint in switching from centrifugal pumps to AFPs is. They stressed two issues as major constraints to AFP adoption. First, all of the sampled service providers were using centrifugal pumps. Despite visible gains from the higher water-lifting capacity and no priming, switching from a centrifugal pump to an AFP requires a substantial amount of new investment. Second, and most importantly, the price of an AFP is comparatively much higher than a centrifugal irrigation pump, which comes as an attachment with an engine of different capacity from a 4-horsepower engine at the minimum. For an AFP, for a new irrigation service provider, it is necessary to purchase an AFP first and engine separately pairing it with the capacity of the pump. Currently, the available AFP in Bangladesh requires an 8&#x02013;12 horsepower engine at the least to accrue the benefits of hydraulic efficiency. The popularity of small horsepower-engine-driven centrifugal pumps and the requirement for a high horsepower engine to run an AFP is a barrier to the rapid adoption of AFPs in Bangladesh.</p><p id="p0220">The expected price that the sampled AFP users offered is calculated in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The price of an AFP is strictly determined by the length and diameter of it. Therefore, the different prices that the sampled users faced are simply because they have used AFPs of different length and diameters. Fifteen of the sampled service providers were unwilling to purchase an AFP; in contrast 55 of the sampled AFP users expressed their willingness to purchase the AFP they had used at the market price. Note that the price range presented in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> are the prices after subsidy.

In addition, the overall marginal effects of each of the variables are presented as some of the variables affected the choice function and price function differently. It shows that, on average, the level of education of a service provider positively but weakly affects the willingness to purchase an AFP (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.10). A service provider with five or more years of schooling is more likely to purchase an AFP, and is willing to offer BDT 2229.2 (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.10) more on average for the AFP he used compared to others. Probably, for the relatively-more educated irrigation service providers, it is easier to more accurately calculate the future stream of benefits from the current level of relatively-higher investment on an improved irrigation machine. It positively affects their decision to purchase and offer a relatively higher price for an AFP. The service providers who are engaged in agriculture full-time are more willing to purchase an AFP (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) and, on average, they are willing to pay BDT 3866.2 more for an AFP than the other service providers. The service providers who are completely dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods are more eager to increase their income from agriculture and, therefore, are ready to invest in more efficient agricultural machinery than others. Conversely, the service providers who are dependent on the non-farm sector for their livelihoods and agriculture is only their part-time job can receive more return from investment in the non-farm sector. Therefore, this group of service providers is not interested in investing in agricultural machinery.<table-wrap id="tbl6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Function estimated applying

1 reduces the offered price for an AFP by BDT 1423. Importantly, the command area that is the size of the land that an irrigation service provider served, positively and significantly affects the willingness to purchase an AFP and the overall price a service provider is willing to offer for the AFP. It shows that, on average, a 1&#x0202f;ha increase in the command area that a service provider served, increases the revealed price for an AFP offered by a service provider by BDT 248 (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.10) probably because an AFP can lift up to 55% more water than a centrifugal pump. Therefore, it is more beneficial for a service provider who provides irrigation services to more land and more clients. On average, the sampled service providers that attached an AFP to a two-wheeled tractor to run the machine were more interested in purchasing an AFP (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.05), and offered BDT4,622 more for the AFP than others. At the lowest, the engine of a two-wheeled tractor should be a 16 horsepower. The minimum requirement to run an AFP was an 8&#x02013;12 horsepower engine. It means the AFP which was run as an attachment to a two-wheeled tractor with a 16-horsepower engine performs much better than others. It positively affects the willingness to purchase and to offer a higher price by the service provider. The physical capital of the service provider in terms of his own land (ha) positively affects the price offered for an AFP, but the overall marginal effect is positive but statistically insignificant. The discharge diameter of an AFP negatively and significantly affects the willingness to purchase an AFP, but is positive and significant in explaining the price a service provider offered. The overall marginal effect of the discharge diameter is insignificant. Similarly, the length of an AFP positively and significantly affected only the price of the AFP that the service provider offered.</p><p id="p0240">The overall effect of the length is insignificant in deciding to purchase an AFP and in offering a price for it (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).

The rapid proliferation of useful technologies can have profound impacts on rural poverty. The present study demonstrates the problems related to the diffusion of a new agricultural technology despite the visible gain from the adoption of it. Using primary data collected in the 2014&#x02013;15 <italic>boro</italic> rice season from 70 irrigation service providers in a demonstration experiment of the axial flow pump (AFP) in eight districts in Bangladesh, this study examined the factors affecting the willingness to purchase an improved agricultural technology in a developing country. In the experiment process, the irrigation service providers were selected based on the fact that they were using conventional low-lift centrifugal pumps for providing irrigation services to client farmers using surface water. Under this demonstration program, an AFP was provided to the selected irrigation service providers for free to use for a season. At the end of the season, the irrigation service providers were requested to rank a number of attributes of the AFP they used in comparison to the centrifugal pump that they were using previously.</p><p id="p0250">The findings of the present study confirmed the claim that, in general, AFPs are more efficient in lifting water than the centrifugal pumps [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, our study demonstrates that, by using an AFP instead of a centrifugal pump, a surface water-based irrigation service provider in Bangladesh can save at least BDT913/ha due to a reduction in fuel requirements as an AFP can lift more water than a centrifugal pump and, thus, requires less machine time for irrigation of the same amount of land which was irrigated the previous year using a centrifugal pump. However, despite the visible benefits of an AFP over centrifugal pumps, the uptake of the machine is low. From October 2013 to September 2018, only 888 units of AFP were sold. However, a rapid scaling up of the AFP, where its use is feasible particularly in the southern region of Bangladesh where surface water is abundant, can reduce irrigation costs and therefore the overall crop production costs significantly.</p><p id="p0255">Based on the findings, the present study suggests conducting more demonstrations and awareness programs of AFP-based irrigation in the areas where there is a high potential for the expansion of irrigation using surface water, particularly, in Chattogram, Khulna, Sylhet and Barishal divisions, where surface water irrigation is prominent. Relatively well-educated irrigation service providers and service providers who are owners of two-wheeled tractors can be targeted, particularly for the rapid diffusion of the AFP in Bangladesh. In addition, based on the requirements, AFPs in Bangladesh should be adjusted to the local demand. For this, the government can provide the necessary technical support to establish local assembling units and workshops. The Government of Bangladesh also may assist in the production of AFP locally. Finally, the price of the AFPs must be competitive with the existing centrifugal pumps. Our study shows that around BDT 10,000 might be a reasonable price for an AFP on average, but this is still much higher than the price of a centrifugal irrigation pump.</p><p id="p0260">The policy implications from the present study can be generalized to other agricultural technologies in developing countries. This study shows that it is necessary to make the new technology compatible with local demand and the environment, and importantly the price of the new technology must be competitive with the existing alternatives. Although it is always assumed that the market mechanism can influence the adoption and scaling up of a technology as farmers are rational, in many cases initial support in the form of subsidies and technical supports can facilitate the scaling up process of a useful technology. The present study, therefore urges the international donor agencies together with the national government to support the scaling up and the adoption of AFPs in Bangladesh, and particularly to strongly support the diffusion of useful agricultural technologies in poverty-stricken developing countries.</p><p id="p0265">Note that this study is based on information collected from 70 sampled AFP users in Bangladesh. In addition, sampled respondents were selected only from Barisal and Dhaka Divisions, although there is a high potential for the expansion of AFP-based surface water-based irrigation systems in Chattogram and Sylhet divisions. Considering these factors as limitations of the present study, future research endeavors should expand the AFP-based irrigation demonstration program to all potential areas of Bangladesh.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>World Bank</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Understanding Poverty</chapter-title><year>2018</year><publisher-name>The World Bank</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Washington D.C</publisher-loc><comment>Available from:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview" id="intref0015">http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>The United Nations</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Sustainable Development Goals</chapter-title><year>2018</year><publisher-name>The United Nations</publisher-name><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><comment>Available from:</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/" id="intref0020">https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>World Bank</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Agriculture for Development.
