We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) among pregnant women in rural Bangladesh and to identify sources of lead exposure. We analyzed the BLLs of 430 pregnant women randomly selected from rural communities in central Bangladesh. Fifty-seven cases were selected with the highest BLLs, &#x02265;&#x0202f;7&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL, and 59 controls were selected with the lowest BLLs, &#x0003c;&#x0202f;2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL. An exposure questionnaire was administered and soil, rice, turmeric, water, traditional medicine, agrochemical, and can samples were analyzed for lead contamination. Of all 430 women, 132 (31%) had BLLs &#x0003e;&#x0202f;5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL. Most women with elevated BLLs were spatially clustered. Cases were 2.6 times more likely than controls to consume food from a can (95% CI 1.0&#x02013;6.3, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.04); 3.6 times more likely to use Basudin, a specific brand of pesticide (95% CI 1.6&#x02013;7.9, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.002); 3.6 times more likely to use Rifit, a specific brand of herbicide (95% CI 1.7&#x02013;7.9, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.001); 2.9 times more likely to report using any herbicides (95% CI 1.2&#x02013;7.3, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.02); and 3.3 times more likely to grind rice (95% CI 1.3&#x02013;8.4, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.01). Five out of 28 food storage cans were lead-soldered. However, there was minimal physical evidence of lead contamination from 382 agrochemical samples and 129 ground and unground rice samples. Among 17 turmeric samples, one contained excessive lead (265&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/g) and chromium (49&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/g). Overall, we found evidence of elevated BLLs and multiple possible sources of lead exposure in rural Bangladesh. Further research should explicate and develop interventions to interrupt these pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Prenatal blood lead levels and lead sources are assessed in rural Bangladesh.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Elevated blood lead levels are found among pregnant women.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Multiple possible sources of lead are identified; all related to food.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Future lead prevention studies should investigate food storage and production.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prenatal lead exposure</kwd><kwd>Case control study</kwd><kwd>Agrochemicals</kwd><kwd>Lead-soldered cans</kwd><kwd>Turmeric</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">As a potent neurotoxin, lead (Pb) poses a serious threat to public health and human intellectual capital worldwide (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2000</xref>). After exposure via inhalation or ingestion, lead circulates in blood and is either excreted via urine or deposited in soft tissue or bone. The mean half-life of lead in blood is approximately 21&#x02013;28 days, whereas lead accumulates in bones with a mean half-life of 5&#x02013;19 years (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rabinowitz et al., 1976</xref>). During pregnancy, lead is mobilized from bones back into maternal blood and readily crosses the placenta into the blood of the developing fetus (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Silbergeld, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;llin et al., 2009</xref>). Prenatal and early childhood lead exposures affect the developing central nervous system and produce irreversible cognitive damage that leads to adverse outcomes in adulthood (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bellinger, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">Before the removal of lead in gasoline between the 1970&#x02013;1990s, global blood lead levels (BLLs) were so high that the adverse effect of low levels of lead exposure was impossible to study (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bridbord and Hanson, 2009</xref>). For example, population mean BLLs dropped more than 75%, from 13&#x02013;25&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL to 2&#x02013;3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL, in the US and South Korea within two decades after phasing out leaded gasoline (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Pirkle et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent multi-year cohort studies conducted in the US, Mexico, Australia, and Yugoslavia generated new evidence showing that lead exposure irreversibly decreases IQ, even at levels below 10&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ernhart et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baghurst et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bellinger et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Schnaas et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Canfield et al., 2003</xref>). A re-analysis of these data indicated that children with BLLs 2.4&#x02013;10&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL had IQ scores that were 3.9 points lower than children with BLLs &#x0003c;&#x0202f;2.4&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lanphear et al., 2005</xref>). In response to such evidence, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has continually lowered the threshold for elevated BLLs from 60&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL in the 1960s to 5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL in 2015 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2015</xref>). However, there is no known safe level of lead in the body.</p><p id="p0035">Bangladesh phased out lead in gasoline in 1999, yet BLLs above 5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL persist across the country (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gleason et al., 2014</xref>). BLLs are comparatively higher in urban versus rural areas, though BLLs are higher than expected in non-industrial rural agrarian regions. In Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, studies since 2000 have shown mean BLLs between 11.5 and 15&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL among children under 16 years of age (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Linderholm et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>). A 2007 study found 10 times higher BLLs in children living in industrial versus non-industrial neighborhoods in Dhaka (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>). Two studies from a rural agrarian region of Munshiganj district found high BLLs among more than 500 children under 4 years of age. In one study, 84% of children had BLLs &#x02265;&#x0202f;5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL and in another, the median BLL was 7.3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gleason et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). In Dinajpur, a different rural agrarian district, two studies reported similar BLLs, with means of 7.2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>) and 7.3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>) among a total of 380 children under 16 years of age. In this region, 25% of 16 parents had BLLs &#x0003e;&#x0202f;10&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>). In rural Narayanganj district, one study of 303 children 8&#x02013;11 years of age reported a mean BLL of 11.5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wasserman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Multiple hypotheses have been explored in the literature for reasons why lead levels are high in rural Bangladesh but none have been conclusive. An analysis of lead exposure and BLLs among 919 children from both Dinajpur and Dhaka found that the mean BLL was 3.7&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL higher for children whose families lived in close proximity to industries (p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) and 2.3&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL higher for children whose families used certain traditional medicines compared to those who did not (p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.004) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>). BLLs were also inversely correlated with body mass index (r&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.23, p&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.001) and hemoglobin levels (r&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;&#x02212;0.10, p&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.02). Low body mass index and low hemoglobin levels are indicators of poor nutrition. Nutrient deficient individuals, especially those lacking divalent metals like iron and calcium, absorb lead more readily, making them prone to lead poisoning (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Goyer, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahamed and Siddiqui, 2007</xref>). Other possible exposure sources included water source, metal taps, and melamine dinner plates, but were not significantly associated with BLLs after controlling for confounders.</p><p id="p0045">Additional studies suggested agricultural and food-related exposure routes. Bergkvist et al. conducted a study of 408 pregnant women and 331 children in rural Chandpur district, concluding that rice may be an important source of lead due to contamination from agrochemicals (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bergkvist et al., 2010</xref>). The median rice lead concentration from 63 households was 0.013&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/g. Based on an estimated consumption of 0.5&#x0202f;kg rice per day, median intake of lead from rice alone would be 6.5&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/day, exceeding the established maximum daily intake limit set by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1993 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2017</xref>). The 2013 Munshiganj study identified turmeric as a potential exposure route since 8 of 18 samples contained greater than 100&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/g Pb (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gleason et al., 2014</xref>). Water, rice, and soil did not contain elevated lead concentrations in household samples and researchers did not attempt to draw statistical associations between BLLs and risk factors.</p><p id="p0050">In an effort to evaluate the prevalence of elevated BLLs among pregnant women in rural Bangladesh and to identify the sources of lead exposure, we conducted a cross-sectional BLL assessment and a case control study.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and study population</title><p id="p0055">The case control study was nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial that began in 2012 and followed 5551 women from their first or second trimester of pregnancy through the first few years of their children's lives (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). A sample size of 500 individuals was calculated to assess the prevalence of elevated BLLs among pregnant women enrolled in the WASH Benefits trial. For budgetary reasons, the sample was reduced to 430. A geographically stratified random sampling approach was used to select women from among all those who reported primarily consuming rice grown in their own field (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1269). This inclusion criterion was chosen because our main hypothesis was that elevated BLLs in rural communities resulted from exposure to lead arsenate pesticide, and restricting to households who could report their own agrochemical use might provide a clearer signal of exposure. Study participants lived in Mymensingh, Tangail, and Kishoreganj districts. Based on the distribution of BLLs from the 430 women, 57 cases were selected who had the highest BLLs, &#x02265;&#x0202f;7&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL, and 59 controls were selected who had the lowest BLLs, &#x0003c;&#x0202f;2&#x0202f;&#x003bc;g/dL. Our sample size of 116 provided 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 2.85 assuming 40% of controls are exposed. We based these power calculations on the hypothesis of a single predominant exposure pathway, that is lead arsenate pesticides.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of participant selection and research activities in Mymensingh, Tangail, and Kishoreganj districts between 2012 and 2015.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Blood sampling and analysis</title><p id="p0060">Between June 2012 to July 2013, before mothers were randomized to an arm of the WASH Benefits trial (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="s0080" ref-type="sec">SI</xref>), research assistants collected 10&#x02009;mL whole blood from all 5551 pregnant mothers using trace metal-free certified needles and tubes.

Soil, rice, turmeric, water, and traditional medicines were collected because of evidence from other studies. To collect soil, research assistants divided participants&#x02019; fields into a grid to randomly select sampling sites. Triplicate samples of soil were collected from the rooting depth of 25&#x02009;cm (core soil) and the upper 2&#x02009;mm (scraping soil). Uncooked rice was collected in resealable polyethylene bags. Research assistants used a random number generator to select a sub-sample of 10 case and 10 control households. From these 20 households, they collected turmeric and water from households&#x02019; wells in resealable polyethylene bags. Water was acidified upon analysis. Research assistants purchased at least one sample of every type of traditional medicine that participants reported using in the exposure questionnaire. This included 12 brands of herbal remedies.</p><p id="p0080">Samples of cans, agrochemicals, and grinding mill rice were collected after the case control study identified elevated odds ratios for lead contamination associated with these exposures. Cans were collected from households who reported consuming food stored in cans. Research assistants purchased the seven most common types of agrochemicals identified in the exposure questionnaire from local stores in each of the eight sub-districts where study participants lived. Samples were collected every month between December through May when agrochemicals are used most frequently. Research assistants visited 15 rice grinding mills used by women with the highest BLLs who reported grinding rice at least three times per year and never consuming food stored in cans. Research assistants conducted semi-structured interviews with mill operators and collected samples of rice before husking (i.e., brown rice with the hull still on), before grinding (i.e., white rice with the hull removed), and after grinding (i.e., rice flour).</p><p id="p0085">Soil samples from study participants&#x02019; fields were analyzed for lead concentrations via x-ray fluorescence (Spectro XEPOS HE, XLab Pro 5.1 software).

Samples of water, traditional medicine, rice, turmeric, and cans were analyzed for lead via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific XSERIES 2 ICP-MS) at Stanford's Environmental Measurements Facility (em1.stanford.edu). Turmeric samples were also analyzed for chromium concentration. Samples of can seams that contained elevated lead concentrations above 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g were analyzed for the spatial distribution of lead within the can seams at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (beamline 10-2); Pb and Fe were mapped at 0.5&#x02009;mm step-sizes by the intensity of the fluorescent X-ray resulting from a primary beam of 13100&#x02009;eV (calibrated to 13100&#x02009;eV) with a pixel collection time of 20&#x02009;ms.

Despite no known industrial or point sources of lead in the region, women with the highest BLLs lived near each other in Mymensingh district. We did not find any associations between BLL and proximity to roads or engagement in risky occupations (the majority of the population make their livelihood in agriculture). This suggests that there may be geographic heterogeneity to one or more of the multiple exposures we identified.</p><p id="p0135">We found associations between elevated BLLs and the consumption of food from cans, use of agrochemicals, and rice grinding; we also found evidence of lead contamination in cans used for storing food and turmeric. We address each of these sources below by comparing the results from this study's exposure questionnaire and laboratory analyses with evidence from prior studies (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).<table-wrap id="t0020" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Summary of exposure questionnaire and laboratory evidence from this and other studies.

The cans were most commonly recycled or repaired with lead solder which could be a more common practice in some regions than others, leading to spatial clustering of BLLs. Historically, lead-soldered cans were common in high-income countries through the 1980s and 1990s. After the U.S. phased out lead-soldered cans in the 1980s, lead concentrations in infant formula dropped by 80%, representing a 20% decrease in overall child lead exposure (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 1991</xref>). Food stored in lead-soldered cans may absorb lead more or less readily depending on the chemical composition of the food, with acidic liquids absorbing the most (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 1996</xref>). In this study, women reported storing solid foods, particularly puffed rice, in the lead-soldered cans but lead could still be transferred from the cans through food to the mothers. One possibility is that since these cans are old and rusted, oxidized lead particles flake off with rust into puffed rice and are inadvertently consumed. Although the combined epidemiological and physical evidence for exposure to lead through cans is compelling, the population attributable risk fraction is only 7.5%, with 32% of cases and 15% of controls using cans to store food. Therefore, we conclude that other sources of lead also contributed to past and present human exposure.</p><p id="p0145">Cases with elevated BLLs were more likely than controls to use Basudin, a diazinon-based organophosphate pesticide, and Rifit, a pretilachlor-based herbicide, and any herbicides on their rice fields. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, lead-based pesticides such as lead arsenate were the most popular pesticides in the world (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hood, 2006</xref>). Although officially banned in 1988 in the US, lead arsenate may have continued to be used in countries with limited regulatory capacity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hood, 2006</xref>). Although we do not have physical evidence of lead contamination from any agrochemical in Bangladesh, we had limited opportunity to assess the lead concentration of Basudin since it was banned in 2013. One complicating factor is the informal market of re-packaging and re-labeling agrochemicals in Bangladesh. Nonetheless, if agrochemicals were a current pathway of exposure at the time of our assessment, we would have seen higher levels of lead contamination in soil and rice among cases who used agrochemicals more frequently than controls, which we did not find. The agricultural soil from cases and controls had similar levels of lead contamination and most of the rice grown in their fields had no detectable lead contamination.</p><p id="p0150">Despite lack of lead in our agrochemical, soil, and rice samples, the exposure questionnaire suggests that agrochemicals, especially Basudin and Rifit, may have contributed to lead exposures in the past. Indeed, a study conducted over 10 years ago in rural Bangladesh found soil lead concentrations to be 2 times higher in agricultural plots compared to nearby non-agricultural plots and 1.5 times higher near the surface compared to a depth of 15&#x02013;30&#x02009;cm (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Muhibbullah et al., 2005</xref>). However, soil lead concentrations were still below the California residential limit of 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">OEHHA, 2018</xref>). A study in Sri Lanka found that one of 26 samples of pesticides and herbicides contained 931&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g Pb but the median value was 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g, suggesting that most samples had no detectable lead but a single type of agrochemical had excessive lead levels (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jayatilake et al., 2013</xref>). Given this heterogeneity found in Sri Lanka, even a single batch of lead-contaminated agrochemicals could contribute to spatial clustering of BLLs. Even though we did not confirm the presence of lead-tainted agrochemicals, the possibility remains that certain agrochemicals are occasionally contaminated with lead in Bangladesh and throughout South Asia due to variability in agrochemical sourcing or manufacturing processes.</p><p id="p0155">Despite a strong association between the practice of rice grinding and BLL from the exposure questionnaire, we lack physical evidence to support this pathway as a source of ongoing exposure. Lead contamination from grinding wheat has been reported in Turkey and Israel, where lead solder was used to repair grinding stones (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Eisenberg et al., 1985</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x000e7;ak et al., 1989</xref>). However, mill operators in the current study did not report repairing stones with lead solder. It is possible that grinding mills in this study repaired stones with lead solder in the past, but we did not find evidence of lead contamination in the rice samples after grinding. Even if one mill operator used lead solder for repair in the past, this could result in spatial clustering of high BLLs since only those consuming rice from that mill would be affected.</p><p id="p0160">From our data, the prevalence of lead-contaminated turmeric is not clear, but other studies have suggested that this may be a problem throughout Bangladesh and the world (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Woolf and Woolf, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Because we only asked about packaged turmeric, we were underpowered to detect the association between turmeric and BLL through the exposure questionnaire. Nevertheless, 1 of 17 samples of turmeric powder contained chromium and more than 100 times the tolerable level of lead in spices. It is suspected that lead chromate, PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, is intentionally added to dried turmeric root and turmeric powder as a color enhancer (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gleason et al., 2014</xref>). The contaminated turmeric in our study also contained chromium with a molar ratio of lead to chromium of 1.3, close to the 1:1 ratio of pure lead chromate (PbCrO<sub>4</sub>). A study of turmeric from Bangladesh and Pakistan measured mean lead concentrations of 1.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g in raw fresh turmeric root (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), 410&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g in dried polished turmeric root (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), 290&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g in unbranded powdered turmeric (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), and 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g in branded powdered turmeric (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Syed et al., 1987</xref>). In 2013, the US FDA recalled Pran brand turmeric imported from Bangladesh due to elevated lead levels (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2013</xref>). However, the contaminated powdered turmeric from our study was unbranded.</p><p id="p0165">This study highlights multiple exposures contributing to elevated BLLs and not a single exposure source. Consequently, our greatest limitation was that we were under-powered to identify uncommon or very common exposures. Although we were underpowered to detect an association between BLL and turmeric in the exposure questionnaire, this may be due to lack of power, because there is truly no association, or because of the way we asked the question in a way that did not allow for a nuanced analysis. We asked about consumption of branded packaged turmeric but did not distinguish based on the form of turmeric (raw fresh root, dried polished root, or powdered), which may be a better indicator of potential exposure.</p><p id="p0170">The delay between time of exposure and time of assessment makes it difficult to implicate sources of lead. BLLs measured during pregnancy may be an indicator of cumulative exposure over a lifetime since lead is stored in the bones for decades and then released into the blood during pregnancy (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rabinowitz et al., 1976</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Rabinowitz, 1991</xref>). Therefore, exposure to lead could have happened a decade prior to our exposure assessment and sample collection. Due to this temporal lag, we may have missed physical evidence of lead contamination from agrochemicals and ground rice. Testing samples for lead contamination is only informative when the current level of contamination is the same as the previous level. When products are banned or practices change, which may have occurred within the agrochemical and rice grinding pathways, physical testing of current exposures for lead contamination becomes uninformative.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0175">Based on this and other studies, elevated BLLs appear to be a widespread problem in many districts across rural Bangladesh. There does not appear to be a single source of lead exposure in this context that can provide a simple focus for prevention, but rather several sources that require further investigation including lead-soldered cans, agrochemicals, rice grinding, and turmeric. Given the spatial clustering of women with elevated BLLs, prevention efforts could target geographic hotspots of lead exposure. Future case control studies should enroll a sufficiently large population to detect less common exposures and to assess the relative importance of each pathway. Although this study does not provide direct evidence, we suspect these exposures are not limited to Bangladesh. We recommend investigations in neighboring countries across South and Southeast Asia.</p><p id="p0180">Moreover, we encourage further investigation into exposure-related practices, including how practices vary both temporally and spatially and how these exposures are driven by economic and social incentives. For the small percentage of the population that stores food in cans, solder from cans may be a source of persistent low doses of lead that accumulate over many years. Taking action to reduce exposure via this pathway will involve exploring the mechanism by which lead gets from the can to the food, why households store food in lead-soldered cans, where the lead solder comes from, what alternative lead-free solders exist, and what actions by government or other actors could limit the use of lead in repair and recycling activities. We suggest that researchers assess past and current agrochemical manufacturing practices to understand the possible addition of lead to agrochemicals. Similarly, more research to assess changes in grinding repair practices would highlight any potential for lead exposure from this pathway over time. We encourage that the issue of lead-adulterated turmeric be explored further since we were underpowered to assess this exposure and yet contaminated turmeric consumption could deliver high doses of lead, impacting not only South Asians but the rest of the world through the global supply chain. By systematically sampling and testing turmeric at different points in the supply chain, and exploring the incentives of the various actors, from farmers, to wholesalers, to retailers, to consumers, we could better identify at which point the lead adulteration may be occurring and where interventions are likely to be most productive.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahamed</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Siddiqui</surname><given-names>M.K.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Environmental lead toxicity and nutritional factors</article-title><source>Clin.
