However, the sequence motifs that affect proglutelin folding, assembly, and their export from the ER remain poorly defined. In this study, we characterized a mutant with nine amino acids deleted in the GluA2 protein, which resulted in specific accumulation of the GluA precursor. The deleted amino acids constitute a well-conserved sequence (LVYIIQGRG) in glutelins and all residues in this motif are necessary for ER export of GluA2. Immunoelectron microscopy and stable transgenic analyses indicated that proglutelins with deletion of this motif misassembled and aggregated through non-native intermolecular disulfide bonds, and were deposited in ER-derived protein bodies (PB-Is), resulting in conversion of PB-Is into a new type of PB. These results indicate that the conserved motif is essential for proper assembly of proglutelin. The correct assembly of proglutelins is critical for their segregation from prolamins in the ER lumen, which is essential for enabling the export of proglutelin from the ER and for the proper formation of PB-Is. We also found that the interchain disulfide bond between acidic and basic subunits is not necessary for their assembly, but it is required for proglutelin folding.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Disulfide bonds</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum export</kwd><kwd>glutelin</kwd><kwd>rice endosperm</kwd><kwd>sequence motif</kwd><kwd>protein assembly</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Science and Technology of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD 0100500</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31300212</award-id><award-id>31171368</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endosperm storage proteins in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) comprise mainly alcohol-soluble prolamins, acid- and alkaline-soluble glutelins, and saline-soluble &#x003b1;-globulin. Prolamins are synthesized on the ER and form spherical protein bodies, PB-Is (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bechtel and Juliano, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Glutelins, accounting for 60&#x02013;80% of the total protein, are encoded by a multigene family and are classified into four subfamilies: GluA, -B, -C, and -D. The GluA and GluB subfamilies are composed of at least three and five members, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Takaiwa <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Kusaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kawakatsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). As a member of the 11S globulin family, glutelins are synthesized as 57-kDa proglutelins (also called glutelin precursors) at the rough ER (rER) and are then transported to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs, also called protein body IIs, PB-IIs) through the Golgi apparatus and dense vesicles (DVs). The proglutelins are ultimately cleaved into ~40-kDa acidic (&#x003b1;) and ~20-kDa basic (&#x003b2;) subunits and deposited together with &#x003b1;-globulin in the PSVs (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yamagata and Tanaka, 1986</xref>). Any defects in the glutelin folding, sorting, and transport processes will lead to high-level accumulation of the 57-kDa proglutelin, referred to as the 57H phenotype. Thus, 57H mutants provide ideal material for investigating the machinery of trafficking of storage proteins.</p><p>Many studies of glutelin intracellular transport in 57H mutants have identified regulatory factors related to movement from the Golgi apparatus to the PSVs and processing within the PSVs. The small GTPase Rab5a and its two guanine exchange factors, VPS9a and GEF2, participate in the transport of proglutelin from the Golgi to the PSVs and are involved in the maintenance of the general structure of endomembrane system (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Wen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). GPA3 forms a regulatory complex with Rab5a and VPS9a and controls DV-mediated post-Golgi trafficking of major storage proteins (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Vacuolar-processing enzyme 1 (VPE1) proteolytically processes proglutelins into acidic and basic subunits, which is essential for the formation of proper crystalline structures in PB-IIs (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Kumamaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The ER is the first compartment of the secretory pathway and is the site where protein synthesis, folding, and assembly take place (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Mikosch and Homann, 2009</xref>). After synthesis on the rER, correct folding and assembly of proteins are crucial for their sorting (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Li, 2014</xref>). Disulfide-bond formation is necessary for folding and assembly of many storage proteins (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kawagoe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Onda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Prolamins are assembled in the ER by intermolecular disulfide bonds, which are essential for stabilizing the PB-I structure. The proglutelins are folded through intramolecular disulfide bonds before being transported from the ER. Knockdown of the oxidoreductase Ero1 inhibits the formation of native disulfide bonds, resulting in aggregation of proglutelins through non-native intermolecular disulfide bonds in the rER (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Onda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) plays an essential role in the oxidative folding of vacuole-targeted storage proteins. In PDI1-1 loss-of-function mutants (e.g. <italic>esp2</italic>) proglutelins interact heterotypically with prolamins within the ER lumen, which leads to the formation of abnormal ER-derived PBs containing both proglutelins and prolamins (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Takemoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Satoh-Cruz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Correctly folded and assembled proglutelins are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus via coat-protein complex-II (COPII) vesicles. Disruption of COPII complex formation by simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Sar1a</italic>, -<italic>b</italic>, and -<italic>c</italic> expression results in the accumulation of proglutelins in the ER, yielding novel ER-derived PBs containing both glutelins and &#x003b1;-globulin (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). GOT1B mediates the export of proglutelins and &#x003b1;-globulin from the ER to the Golgi via COPII vesicles (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to external factors, intrinsic sequence motifs play important roles in determining the correct folding, assembly, and export of proteins from the ER. Phaseolin is a major 7S-class storage protein of the common bean and the C-terminal domain and internal region are necessary for trimeric assembly (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Pedrazzini <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Foresti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, our understanding of the sequence motifs in rice proglutelins that determine their folding, assembly, and export from the ER remains limited. In this study, we identified a well-conserved sequence involved in the correct assembly of proglutelins through characterization of a 57H mutant and transgenic lines. Our results indicated that a conserved nine-residue motif, LVYIIQGRG, is essential for proper assembly of proglutelin in the ER lumen and for subsequent export from the ER. We also found that the interchain disulfide bond between acidic and basic subunits is not necessary for proglutelin assembly but is required for its folding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>The rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) EM1317 mutant line was induced by <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (MNU) mutagenesis as described previously (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Kumamaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>).

The PDI1-1 mutation (<italic>esp2/pdi1-1</italic>) blocks the proglutelins in the ER, resulting in small ER-derived protein bodies without normal PB-Is (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Takemoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Mutations affecting the glutelin ER export step, including <italic>glup2/gpa4/got1b</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), and <italic>Sar1</italic>-RNAi lines (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) result in ER-derived protein bodies with an electron-dense core surrounded by large amounts of protein aggregates with low electron density. In mutants with defects in transport from the Golgi apparatus to PSVs, such as <italic>gpa1/glup4/rab5a</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), <italic>glup6/gpa2/vps9a</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and <italic>gpa3</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), glutelins are secreted extracellularly, forming paramural bodies and reducing the size of PB-IIs but with normal PB-Is. In the <italic>W379/glup3/vpe1</italic> mutant, proglutelins that fail to be proteolytically processed in the PSVs form round-shaped PB-IIs that lack the typical crystalline lattice structure (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Kumamaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In the EM1317 mutant endosperm, normal PB-Is were not observed, and a new type of PB was formed instead. These nPB-Is were spherical and much smaller than normal PB-Is, and did not have the concentric ring structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the nPB-Is contained both glutelins and prolamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). These characteristics of nPB-Is in the EM1317 endosperm were similar to those in the <italic>esp2</italic> mutant, suggesting that the mutated GluA2 was blocked in the ER due to a defect in folding or assembly of the protein.</p><p>It has been reported that 10-kDa and 13-kDa prolamins accumulate in the central core and peripheral layers of PB-Is, respectively, thus forming the concentric ring structure of PB-Is (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Nagamine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In addition, the segregation of prolamins and proglutelins in the ER is critical for proper formation of PB-Is. In <italic>esp2</italic> seeds, proglutelins form complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonds with prolamins and accumulate in the ER, resulting in deformation of the structure of PB-Is (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Takemoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Onda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, the mutated GluA2 formed aggregates homologously through non-native intermolecular disulfide bonds, rather than with prolamines, in the ER lumen, which also deformed the structure of the PB-Is. Similar results were observed in mGluA2 and mGluB4 transgenic seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). The accumulation of mutated proglutelins in the ER also disrupted the concentric ring structure of the PB-Is in the transgenic seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, in <italic>Sar1</italic>-RNAi seeds, proglutelin does not exit from the ER and it forms novel PBs, while the PB-Is are mostly normal and distinct from them (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). These results suggest that the correct assembly of proglutelins is critical for segregation of prolamins from proglutelins in the ER lumen, which is essential for the proper formation of PB-Is. Failing to acquire the correct conformation, proglutelins tend to be incorporated into prolamin PBs, disturbing the structure of PB-Is.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>The LVYIIQGRG motif is essential for the correct assembly of proglutelins</title><p>Previously, we reported that proglutelins are exported from the ER through the coat-protein complex-II (COPII; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). our observation here that the mutated proglutelins were blocked in the ER gives rise to the question of whether the LVYIIQGRG motif acts as an ER export signal for proglutelins. To answer this question, we constructed a three-dimensional structural model of GluA2 based on the known structure of the pumpkin pro-11S globulin, which shares 42% amino acid similarity with GluA2 (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Tandang-Silvas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Homology model structure analysis predicted that the LVYIIQ sequence forms a &#x003b2;-sheet buried inside the structure and that the LVYIIQGRG motif is not exposed at the protein surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>). The LVYIIQGRG motif does not contain the classical di-acidic ([D/E]&#x000d7;[E/D]) or di-hydrophobic (FF, FY) ER export signals identified in plant transmembrane proteins. Moreover, the phenotype of nPB-Is in the EM1317 mutant was different from that in <italic>got1b</italic> and <italic>Sar1</italic>-RNAi lines that are defective in COPII, but it was similar to that in the <italic>esp2</italic> mutant, suggesting that the mutated GluA2 was defective in protein folding or assembly. The LVYIIQGRG motif was fused to the N-terminus of GFP under the control of the <italic>35S</italic> promoter and a signal peptide of GluA2. The construct was transiently expressed in rice protoplasts, and we found that the LVYIIQGRG motif could not guide GFP to exit from the ER (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S10</xref>). Therefore, this motif may not act as an ER export signal recognized by Sec24.</p><p>Not all amino acid sequence changes in glutelin affect its transport. The C-terminus of the glutelin acidic subunit is called the hypervariable region (HVR), where the length and amino acid composition vary markedly among the 11S globulins. It has been reported that insertion of 150 residues into HVR does not affect its transport to PB-IIs and that it is processed normally (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Yasuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Expression of unprocessed proglutelin with a mutation in the conserved processing site (Asn-Gly) at the junction between the acidic and basic chains does not affect protein trafficking and accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wakasa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In our study, LVYIIQGRG-deleted GluA2 was blocked in the ER. Amino acid sequence alignment of GluA2 and other 11S globulin family members revealed that some residues of the LVYIIQGRG motif were conserved in the 11S globulin family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S11</xref>). Crystal structure analysis of soybean proA3B4 indicated that Gly-74 is involved in correct globular folding (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Tandang-Silvas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The corresponding glycine in GluA2 is Gly-111, which is located in the conserved motif. This suggests that Gly-111 and the surrounding residues may play important roles in maintaining correct folding and in assembly of proglutelins.</p><p>Proglutelins are assembled as trimers in the ER lumen, similar to leguminous 11S globulins (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wakasa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, most mGluA2 or mGluB4 aggregated as dimers through non-native intermolecular disulfide bonds. The solubility of the mutated proglutelins also changed and the mGluA2 proglutelin could not be extracted with saline solution, and its dissolution depended on the reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). These results indicated that the deleted amino acids were necessary for correct assembly of proglutelins. Internal regions that are necessary for protein assembly have been reported in phaseolin (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Foresti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>); however, no sequence motif has been reported in rice glutelins. The present study extends our understanding of protein folding, assembly, and export in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Intramolecular disulfide bonds are not necessary for proglutelin assembly</title><p>It has been reported that malformation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between globulin and prolamins in the ER lumen results in the retention of globulin in ER PBs (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kawagoe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In <italic>esp2/pdi1-1</italic> proglutelins are assumed to co-assemble with prolamins via intermolecular disulfide bonds to form intracisternal aggregates within the ER (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Takemoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In contrast with <italic>esp2</italic>, the expression level of PDI1-1 was increased in the EM1317 mutant endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>). Although a high-mass proglutelin was detected in the NR-P fractions, proteins with the mass of prolamin (proglutelin-bonded prolamin) could not be detected, and the prolamins and mGluA2 were enriched in different fractions following SDG centrifugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7D</xref>). These results indicated that the non-native intermolecular disulfide bonds were formed among mutated glutelin molecules rather than between mutated glutelin and prolamin molecules, which explains why only the mutated proglutelins were blocked in the ER. This is not surprising because glutelin and prolamin are synthesized in the cisternal and PB-ER, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Washida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and PDIL1-1 is predominantly located in the cisternal ER rather than distributed on PB-ER (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Satoh-Cruz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). The nascent proglutelin is initially bound with PDI and therefore it is less likely to bind with prolamin. Furthermore, it has been reported that folding drives the formation of disulfide bonds, and the pairing of cysteines is determined by substrate protein rather than by PDI (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson and Gilbert, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Kosuri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Trimerization of proglutelins in the ER lumen is essential for their transport into the PSVs. In the process, it has been proposed that GluA proglutelins undergo heteroassembly with GluB (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Wakasa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). If the mutated proglutelins assemble with other proglutelins, it may result in transport of the mutant protein to the PSVs due to the presence of export signals in the wild-type proglutelins. Otherwise, the normal proglutelins would also be blocked in the ER due to improper conformation with the mutated proglutelin. However, only the proglutelins with the mutated motif (mGluA2, mGluA1, or mGluB4) were blocked in the ER, while the wild-type proglutelins were sorted to the PSVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results suggested that proglutelin was assembled homologously as a trimer in the ER lumen. The simultaneous mutation of Cys-122 and Cys-313 in mGluA2 did not recover the ER export or PSV-targeting of the protein, and the mutated proglutelins remained aggregated through intermolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>). On the other hand, disruption of the intramolecular disulfide bond by a single cysteine mutation (C122S or C313S) in GluA2 did not cause a larger molecular mass aggregate of the proglutelins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>). These results suggested that the intramolecular disulfide bonds may not be essential for the correct assembly of proglutelin to trimers, and the trimerization of proglutelins may be mediated through hydrophobic interaction. This is supported by reports that disrupted inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds of glycinin and legumin do not prevent their assembly into trimers (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Utsumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Deletion of the motif may disrupt the hydrophobic interaction leading to the misassembly of proglutelins. It is notable that GluA2 with a single cysteine mutation (C122S or C313S) accumulated more proglutelins. Although the extraction of these proglutelins required reducing conditions, they were maintained as monomers. These results indicated that the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-122 and Cys-313 is important for the correct folding of proglutelins, which may in turn affect their transport.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s24"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
