    "BACKGROUND:The gram-negative Xanthomonas genus contains a large group of economically important plant pathogens, which cause severe diseases on many crops worldwide. The diffusible signal factor (DSF) - mediated quorum sensing (QS) system coordinates expression of virulence factors in plant pathogenic Xanthomonas spp. However, the regulatory effects of this system during the Xanthomonas- plant interactions remain unclear from both the pathogen and host aspects. RESULTS:In this study, we investigated the in planta DSF- mediated QS regulon of X. citri subsp. citri (Xac), the causal agent of citrus canker. We also characterized the transcriptional responses of citrus plants to DSF-mediated Xac infection via comparing the gene expression patterns of citrus trigged by wild type Xac strain 306 with those trigged by its DSF- deficient (∆rpfF) mutant using the dual RNA-seq approach. Comparative global transcript profiles of Xac strain 306 and the ∆rpfF mutant during host infection revealed that DSF- mediated QS specifically modulates bacterial adaptation, nutrition uptake and metabolisms, stress tolerance, virulence, and signal transduction to favor host infection. The transcriptional responses of citrus to DSF-mediated Xac infection are characterized by downregulation of photosynthesis genes and plant defense related genes, suggesting photosynthetically inactive reactions and repression of defense responses. Alterations of phytohormone metabolism and signaling pathways were also triggered by DSF-mediated Xac infection to benefit the pathogen. CONCLUSIONS:Collectively, our findings provide new insight into the DSF- mediated QS regulation during plant-pathogen interactions and advance the understanding of traits used by Xanthomonas to promote infection on host plants."
