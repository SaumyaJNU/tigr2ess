    "Stigma exsertion is a key determinant to increase the efficiency of commercial hybrid rice seed production. The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) qSE7 for stigma exsertion rate was previously detected on the chromosome 7 using 75 Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines (CSSLs) derived from a cross between the high stigma exsertion indica maintainer XieqingzaoB (XQZB) and low stigma exsertion indica restorer Zhonghui9308 (ZH9308). The C51 line, a CSSL population with an introgression from XQZB, was backcrossed with ZH9308 to produce the secondary F2 (BC5F2) and F2:3 (BC5F2:3) populations. As a result, the Near Isogenic Line (NIL qSE7XB) was developed. Analysis indicated qSE7 acted as a single Mendelian factor and decreased the stigma exsertion. We hypothesized qSE7 regulates single, dual, and total stigma exsertion rate, provided experimental support. qSE7 was mapped and localized between RM5436 and RM5499 markers, within a physical distance of 1000-kb. With use of new insertion-deletion (InDel) markers and analysis of the heterozygous and phenotypic data, it was ultimately dissected to a 322.9-kb region between InDel SER4-1 and RM5436. The results are useful for additional identification and isolation of this candidate gene controlling stigma exsertion rate, and provide a basis for further fine mapping, gene cloning, and Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) breeding later."
