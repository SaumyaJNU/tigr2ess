H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profiles as well as antioxidative systems have been investigated in the cultured cells of rice obtained from Italian rice varieties with different salt tolerance. Salt stress highlighted differences in extracellular and intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profiles in the two cell cultures. The tolerant variety had innate reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems that enabled ROS, in particular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, to act as a signal molecule rather than a damaging one. Different intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profiles were also observed: in tolerant cells, an early and narrow peak was detected at 5 min; while in sensitive cells, a large peak was associated with cell death. Likewise, the transcription factor salt-responsive ethylene responsive factor 1 (TF SERF1), which is known for being regulated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, showed a different expression profile in the two cell lines. Notably, similar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profiles and cell fates were also obtained when exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was produced by glucose/glucose oxidase (GOX) treatment. Under salt stress, the tolerant variety also exhibited rapid upregulation of K<sup>+</sup> transporter genes in order to deal with K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> impairment. This upregulation was not detected in the presence of oxidative stress alone. The importance of the innate antioxidative profile was confirmed by the protective effect of experimentally increased glutathione in salt-treated sensitive cells. Overall, these results underline the importance of specific H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signatures and innate antioxidative systems in modulating ionic and redox homeostasis for salt stress tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>K<sup>+</sup> transporters</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic></kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>redox homeostasis</kwd><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="78"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Soil salinization is a major constraint on crop production worldwide and affects at least 33% of arable lands. In addition, more areas are expected to deteriorate in the coming years due to global climate changes (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Tester and Davenport, 2003</xref>; FAO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup>). Plants differ greatly in their tolerance to salinity. This stress has two different components, osmotic and ionic, both affecting plant cell metabolism (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Huang, 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, most crop species cannot withstand high concentrations of salt, and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is the most salt-sensitive cereal species (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Flowers and Yeo, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Soil salinity imposes two primary stresses on plants: firstly osmotic stress, and later ionic stress arises when Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations reach toxic levels inside the cells (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>). To deal with this adverse condition, plants have evolved a range of physiological and metabolic responses, activating many stress-responsive genes and synthesizing diverse functional proteins and metabolites through a complex signal transduction network (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Long-term responses, such as the production of compatible solutes or the regulation of ion channels/transporters involved in the maintenance of a high cytosolic (cyt) [K<sup>+</sup>]/[Na<sup>+</sup>], have been reported as important features for acquiring salt tolerance (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Deinlein et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The molecular processes controlling early salt stress perception and signaling are not yet fully understood. High salinity is known to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within plant cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Huang, 2014</xref>) at very early response stages (e.g., a few minutes in rice roots, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Formentin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While ROS can cause oxidative stress, several studies have shown that ROS also play a key role in plants as signal molecules (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Foyer and Noctor, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Sewelam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Mittler, 2017</xref>). ROS-mediated signaling is controlled through a delicate balance between its production and scavenging. The biological outcome of ROS signaling is heavily related to the chemical identity of ROS, the intensity and subcellular localization of the signal, and is dose dependent (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Gechev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">de Pinto et al., 2006</xref>). Salt-induced ROS are predominantly represented by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Pang and Wang, 2008</xref>). Low doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have been shown to induce protective mechanisms and acclimation responses against oxidative and various abiotic stresses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Gechev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Pucciariello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Locato et al., 2018</xref>). Elevated concentrations of ROS, alone or in combination with other molecules, induced by several stresses can trigger programmed cell death (PCD; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">de Pinto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">De Michele et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Locato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Locato and De Gara, 2018</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, to prevent oxidative damage induced by the high production of ROS, plants have evolved enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative systems, which are crucial for ROS homeostasis by controlling the levels of ROS inside the cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Tuteja, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice exposed to salt stress, ROS release depends on the activity of NADPH oxidases (NOXs) of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein C-like (RBOH) family (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production may initiate an early signal cascade that triggers salt response mechanisms. A signal transduction cascade has been proposed in which a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and downstream TFs represent key regulatory components of ROS signaling (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Pang and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Sewelam et al., 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al. (2013)</xref> identified a SERF1 in rice as a TF that regulates ROS-dependent signaling during the initial response to salt stress.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on intraspecific salt tolerance mechanisms comprising both the regulation of cell redox homeostasis and ionic balance under salinity (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2015</xref>). An increase in the understanding of new salinity tolerance mechanisms, particularly in crops, is required in order to combine all tolerance mechanisms in a new variety with a high level of salt tolerance (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, although <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> is a salt-sensitive species, few salt tolerance traits have been identified in tolerant varieties (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Mohammadi-Nejad et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The study reported in this paper was performed on suspension cell cultures obtained from the seeds of two Italian rice varieties showing contrasting salt sensitivity, Baldo (B) and Vialone Nano (VN). Suspension cell cultures have been widely used to investigate the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in plant responses to abiotic stress (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Vera-Estrella et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Locato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hamaji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Sgobba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Plant suspension cell cultures offer a simplified model for the study of cellular and molecular processes. Their main advantage is that a relatively homogenous population provides a rapid and uniform response to external stimuli, avoiding the complications that arise from using the whole plant. Therefore, the timeline of cellular events following a particular stimulus can be addressed with a very high accuracy. Several parameters of cell growth, senescence and death have also been precisely defined in suspension cell cultures (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carimi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">de Pinto et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Zottini et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a component of the signaling pathway induced by salt stress in the two rice cell cultures showing contrasting salt sensitivity.</p><p>Our results show that the fine-tuning of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging, through efficient antioxidative systems, is critical in shaping an effective H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profile to induce an adaptive response in salt tolerant cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Salt Treatment</title><p>Experiments were conducted with non-embryogenic suspension cell cultures of two rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> spp. <italic>japonica</italic>, L.) varieties, Baldo and Vialone Nano. Briefly, mature seeds were dehusked and sterilized in 3.5% bleach with the addition of a drop of TWEEN20 for 20 min in a giratory shaker, followed by 5 min with 3.5% bleach. After five washes in distilled water, seeds were sawn in solid N6 medium [30 g L<sup>-1</sup> sucrose, Chu (N6) Medium Salt Mixture and vitamins (Duchefa) and 2 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 2,4-D, pH 5.8] in dark conditions and moved to new plates every 2 weeks. After few months, the callus was friable, and ready to be transferred in liquid medium. The resulting cells were grown at 25&#x000b0;C under dark conditions on a gyratory shaker in liquid N6 medium. Every week they were filtered to eliminate bigger clumps until quite homogeneous cells were obtained. For the following subculturing, two mL of packed cells were transferred into 50 mL fresh medium every 7 days (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cimini et al., 2018</xref>). Cells at 3 days after subculture were treated by adding 50, 100, or 150 mM NaCl to culture medium and used for the following experiments. Three independent experiments have been performed for each treatment to determine the growth capabilities of the two cell lines under salt stress, cells were filtered and the fresh and the dry weight were measured.</p><p>The osmotic stress contribution to cell death has been assessed by comparing the treatments with 100 mM NaCl and 200 mM <sc>D</sc>-mannitol.

Briefly, in three independent experiments for each treatment, one mL of cell suspension was sampled from the cultures at desired intervals. Evans blue dye solution was added to the cells to a final concentration of 0.05% and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by washes with water until the washing showed no significant blue color. The washed cells were then added to 50% methanol containing 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and incubated at 55&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The resulting OD was compared to the absorbance of cells boiled for 45 min, which are considered as 100% dead.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA Laddering</title><p>Briefly, 1 g of cells was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. Hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) isolation buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0) at 60&#x000b0;C, freshly supplemented with 10 mM mercaptoethanol, was added to broken cells and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was incubated at 60&#x000b0;C for 40 min. Nucleic acids were extracted with equal volume of phenol and chloroform&#x02013;isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) and centrifuged at 3000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min.

One ml of cell suspension was incubated with 20 &#x003bc;M DHR123 for 15 min in a rotating shaker, and then cells were washed three times with 1 mL of N6 medium. For fluorescence analyses, cells were imaged under a fluorescence microscope (DM5000, Leica Microsystems, Germany) with a I3 filter. About 100 images containing at least 10 cells were analyzed for each timepoint and treatment using ImageJ2 (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>). The total fluorescence was measured using the &#x0201c;Analyze particles&#x0201d; plug-in and averaged over the total area. In order to estimate the endogenous level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of B and VN lines, cell extracts were obtained. At this purpose, B and VN cultured cells were pre-incubated with 20 &#x003bc;M DHR123 for 15 min, washed, harvested and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was quantified by using a spectrofluorometric standard curve (&#x003bb; excitation = 490 nm; &#x003bb; emission = 524 nm) obtained adding known amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the cell extracts.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Antioxidant Activity and ASC and GSH Levels</title><p>The antioxidant activity was measured in B and VN cells under control and treatment conditions as reported in <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Locato et al.

In particular, the antioxidant activity was measured by the 2,2&#x02032;-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS)/horseradish peroxidase decolouration method in three independent experiments. This method enables to measure hydrophilic antioxidant and lipophilic antioxidant activity. Briefly, cells (0.3 g) were ground in a mortar in liquid nitrogen with 1.2 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for the determination of the hydrophilic antioxidant activity and with 1.2 ml of ethanol for that of lipophilic one. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C and the capability of the supernatants to scavenge the ABTS radical cations was compared with a standard dose&#x02013;response curve obtained using 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) and was expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalent per gram fresh weight. Being a hydrophobic compound, to dissolve Trolox in hydrophilic environment the standard solutions were sonicated for 30 min.</p><p>In three independent experiments for each treatment, cells (0.5 g) were collected by filtration and homogenized by adding four volumes of cold 5% (w/v) meta-phosphoric acid at 4&#x000b0;C for ASC and GSH assay.

The reaction was started by adding 3 units of glutathione reductase and was monitored by measuring the change in absorbance at 412 nm during 1 min. GSH was estimated as the difference between the amount of total glutathione and that of GSSG.

B cells, on the other hand, showed a smaller increase in the amount of cell death at 2 days.

The addition of <sc>D</sc>-mannitol in a concentration causing the same osmotic stress as 100 mM NaCl, induced a little increase in cell death respect to the control cells at 4 days of treatment, thus suggesting that the ion toxicity is contributing greater than osmotic stress to cell death (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Cell growth and cell death of B and VN suspension cultured cells in presence and absence of NaCl.

An initial characterization of Italian rice varieties identified VN and B as two cultivars with contrasting salt sensitivities: VN is more sensitive and B more tolerant (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bertazzini and Forlani, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Formentin et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate salt-stress responses at the cellular level, suspension cell cultures from seeds of both varieties were generated. Notably, VN and B suspension cell cultures showed the same differences in salt sensitivity, as did whole plants.</p><p>We demonstrated that upon treatment with NaCl, B cells are able to set up specific tolerance mechanisms, whereas VN cells undergo cell death. Indeed, genomic DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), a hallmark of PCD (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Hoeberichts and Woltering, 2003</xref>), and upregulation of &#x003b1;<italic>-DOX2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), a gene known for being associated with PCD (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Koeduka et al., 2005</xref>) occur in salt-treated VN cells. Consistently with the different stress sensitivity, the expression of &#x003b1;<italic>-DOX2</italic> remained unaltered in B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), except for a slight and transient peak observed at 24 h, perhaps occurring as a common feature of stress response.</p><p>High salinity imposes two stress to cells: osmotic and ionic. The former takes place very early upon salt administration as a direct effect of the osmotic pressure increase at the plasma membrane. The latter takes hours or days depending on the speed of toxic ions accumulation and consequent metabolism impairment (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Huang, 2014</xref>). Though osmotic stress can contribute to the death of cells in the culture, we observed that the ionic component is more threatful and is accountable for the high death percentage measured after 4 days of treatment. In fact, the tolerance of B cells is related to the maintenance of the ion homeostasis, and in particular B cells, after an initial K<sup>+</sup> loss, are able to increase [K<sup>+</sup>]/[Na<sup>+</sup>] ratio and restore survival conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This ability is a cost-effective trait of salt tolerance in plant cells (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Senadheera et al., 2009</xref>). The analysis of the expression of genes involved in Na<sup>+</sup> extrusion from the cytosol (<italic>OsNHX1; OsSOS1</italic>) did not reveal any difference between the two varieties; whereas, among the K<sup>+</sup> transporters analyzed, the plasma membrane-located high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter (<italic>OsHAK5</italic>) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Horie et al., 2011</xref>) and the vacuolar-localized two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels (<italic>OsTPKa</italic> and <italic>OsTPKb</italic>) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Isayenkov et al., 2011</xref>), all implicated in increasing the [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, exhibited different expression patterns between the two cell lines. These findings demonstrated that B cells actuated an ion homeostasis recovery obtained by controlling K<sup>+</sup> concentration through the upregulation of <italic>OsHAK5</italic>, <italic>OsTPK1a</italic>, and <italic>OsTPK1b</italic> earlier and at more extent than VN cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,E</xref>). Recently, the high capability to retain K<sup>+</sup> in plant tissues has been proposed as a genetic trait conferring salinity tolerance (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, the increased K<sup>+</sup> uptake in over-expressing <italic>OsHAK1</italic> rice plants seemed to sustain plant growth under K<sup>+</sup> depletion, probably preserving the functionality of photosynthetic apparatus, normally reduced under NaCl stress (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>These data indicate that salt stress induced different response pathways in the two cell lines, leading to a different cell fate: PCD or recovery. In order to better understand the signaling pathways leading to these different metabolic responses, the alterations relative to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and cellular redox homeostasis were studied in cell cultures of the two varieties exposed to salt stress.</p><p>In plants, ROS, which are produced by various metabolic pathways, are increased under salt stress (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Apel and Hirt, 2004</xref>). Notably, in our study in B cells no increase in extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was observed under salt treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), while there was a biphasic trend (5 min and 24 h peaks, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), typical of PCD (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">De Gara et al., 2003</xref>), in the medium of VN sensitive cells. This difference was also reflected in the alterations of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels occurring after salt treatment in the two varieties cell lines, with a clear difference in the shape and timing of the first early peak (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref>) and in the extent of long-term H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. Indeed, VN cells responded to salt slowly by generating an initial large peak of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> around 1 h, whereas B cells showed a quick response with a narrow H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> peak at 5 min. Over the following days, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> continued to accumulate in a dose-dependent manner and to a much higher extent in sensitive compared to tolerant cells. These results seem to characterize the different response to salt stress of the two varieties, since salt stress induced an early peak of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also in roots of B plants with respect to VN roots (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Formentin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although high levels of ROS induce cell death (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">de Pinto et al., 2006</xref>), a controlled and transient production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been associated with many signaling pathways, leading to stress tolerance (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Jaspers and Kangasjarvi, 2010</xref>). Consistently, the decreased ROS production observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RBOHD1/2-RBOH1F/2 silenced plants lead to increased sensitivity to salt (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the expression of salt-responsive genes seems to be activated by ROS (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Locato et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the transient increase in intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> observed in the tolerant variety highlights its signaling function in the activation of a salt defense response in B cells. The expression profile of <italic>SERF1</italic>, a gene involved in salt-induced and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling processes (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>), also followed the internal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profile, with a strong peak at 10 min in B cells and a large and late peak at 6 h in VN sensitive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>The different H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and profiles detected in VN and B cells may depend on the different detoxification capacities of the two rice cell cultures. In order to assess this, gene expression and activities of enzymes involved in antioxidant systems were performed.</p><p>The expression analysis of genes encoding ROS-detoxifying enzymes showed that, under salt stress, B cells upregulated <italic>SODCC2</italic>, <italic>APX1</italic>, and <italic>APX2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) more or earlier than VN cells. This suggests that the tolerant variety is more able to modulate the expression of genes aimed at controlling ROS levels than the sensitive variety. Accordingly, the ectopic expression of cytosolic APX and SOD has been found to increase the tolerance to salt stress of plum plants (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Diaz-Vivancos et al., 2013</xref>). The salt-dependent upregulation of several ROS scavenging genes has also been reported in other rice varieties (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>When these enzymes were analyzed in terms of their kinetic activities, no significant differences between the behaviors of the two varieties were induced by salt stress (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This apparent absence of the consistency between gene expression and enzyme activities can be explained by the two used experimental approaches: antioxidative activities were assessed as a whole, independently by the presence of different isoenzymes putatively differently regulated, whereas expression profiles were analyzed for genes encoding single isoenzymes.</p><p>Different timings in the processes occurring downstream of the gene expression, protein turnover and post-transcriptional modification, which affect enzymatic activity, could also be another reason for the lack of consistent results between these two experimental approaches. However, the presence of a higher redox control in B than in VN cells is also suggested by the different levels of enzyme activities involved in ROS scavenging which the tolerant variety already showed under control conditions. Notably, the activities of MDHAR, GR, CAT, and cAPX were already higher in the tolerant variety than in the sensitive variety under control conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), as well as the glutathione content was significantly higher in B than in VN cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). When the activity of the mentioned redox enzymes were analyzed in B and VN seedlings, consistent results were obtained. In particular, cAPX and MDHAR activities were 30% higher in B than in VN, whereas CAT showed 15% higher activity in B than in VN seedlings (Ronci, Locato, De Gara personal communication). This further supports the innate higher capacity of ROS scavenging in B, which is important for inducing a higher tolerance to salt stress. It is also worth noting that when the glutathione level was enhanced in VN by its exogenous addition in the culture medium, salt-induced cell death was prevented, further confirming that innate levels of antioxidative defense are pivotal in tolerating this stress. Consistently, sulfur supplementation increased salt tolerance in mustard by reducing oxidative stress (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Fatma et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The results of the exposure of the two cell cultures to oxidative stress imposed by the glucose/GOX-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in culture medium provide additional proof of the higher ROS-scavenging capacity of B cells. Indeed, the tolerant variety was able to scavenge the exogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> more efficiently than the sensitive variety (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and to prevent cell death; whereas, the exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production induced cell death in the sensitive VN line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A</xref>). It is interesting to note that in spite of the constant and high production of ROS caused by the addition to culture medium of glucose/GOX, the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> profiles looked different in the two rice lines. The tolerant cells were able to maintain the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signature observed under salt stress, with an early transient peak reaching its maximum at 10 min and disappearing in 1 h. On the other hand, the sensitive variety showed a peak with a maximum at 30 min, after which intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> persisted at a much higher level than in the control conditions. Again, the expression pattern of <italic>SERF1</italic>, the transcription factor induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, was different in the two cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11C</xref>), showing a similar trend to that observed in response to salt stress. Consistently, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hoang et al. (2015)</xref> reported that transgenic rice overexpressing anti-apoptotic genes showed reduced ROS accumulation and increased salt tolerance.</p><p>It is worth noting that in oxidative stress conditions but without salt stress, no induction in the expression of the three genes, <italic>OsHAK5</italic>, <italic>OsTPK1a</italic>, and <italic>OsTPK1b</italic>, contributing to the increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> were observed in the B tolerant cells. This result, which is in line with the absence of ionic stress, suggests that the signaling pathway involving the activation of <italic>SERF1</italic> is not the only one required for a correct metabolic adjustment which enables cells to counteract salt stress.</p><p>Overall these results show that in our experimental system, a difference in time, extent and intensity of the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in response to salt stress, along with a different innate antioxidative activity/ROS scavenging capacity, could be responsible for the different fate and defense responses observed in the two cell lines (i.e., the induction of resistant mechanisms in B cells and the process of cell death in VN cells). At the same time, it is evident that B bases its resistance to salt stress on its better capacity to coordinate the co-presence of different stimuli (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ionic stress in our case) and to trigger complex responses, which maintain redox and ionic homeostasis within cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>EF, MZ, LDG, and FLS designed the research.
