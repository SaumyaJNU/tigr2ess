    "Microbial contamination has been a pervasive issue during the rice storage and triggers extensive researches. The metabolism of microorganisms was proved as an indicator to mirror the degree of microbial contamination. It is necessary to develop a scientific method to analyze the metabolism of rice microbial communities, thereby monitoring the microbial contamination. In this study, the metabolism of rice microbial communities in different storing-year were investigated by BIOLOG ECO microplates. The three rice samples were respectively stored for 1-3 years. The related indicators of BIOLOG ECO microplates were determined, including average well-color development (AWCD) of carbon sources and three metabolic functional diversity indices. The results showed that there were significant differences in the AWCD of all carbon sources among the three rice microbial communities (p < 0.05), and the functional diversity indices except Simpson index showed significant differences (p < 0.05). Additionally, the three rice microbial communities differed significantly in the metabolic utilization of carboxylic acids and miscellaneous (p < 0.05), and there were, however, no significant differences in the other four types of carbon sources. Furthermore, principal component analysis revealed that the microbial communities of stored rice had obviously different metabolic functions in different storage period. Therefore, the study indicated that the BIOLOG ECO microplate was applicable to evaluate the metabolic functions of rice microbial communities, and carboxylic acids and miscellaneous were two crucial parameters of carbon sources to identify the metabolic differences of microbial communities, a case in which it reflected the conditions of rice microbial contamination."
