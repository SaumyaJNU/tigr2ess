Since time in memorial dairy farmers of Tamil Nadu, India, belonging to the unorganized sector have been feeding their native cattle breeds having low productive potential with available feed resources, namely, grains of pearl millet, sorghum, maize, broken rice, and agricultural by-products such as rice bran, oil cakes, stovers, and straw [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most of the farmers in the semi-intensive rearing of dairy animals feed crop residues as a major source of roughage with one or two concentrate ingredients, while only a few farmers feed commercial concentrate mixtures to their animals [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In a survey to determine traditional feeding practices for cross-bred dairy cattle reared in Tamil Nadu, it was found that the animals were being fed on gruel based unbalanced feed [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the gruel includes kitchen waste, table waste, etc., apart from the decanted gruel on cooking rice.</p><p>With the advent of cross-breeding with superior germplasm, many farmers continue the traditional feeding pattern along with supplemental oil cakes. However, the ever-rising cost of oil cakes has resulted in farmers feeding more of rice grains/rice bran with or without gruel causing lower protein leading to a mismatch between energy and nitrogen supply in the rumen [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Excess feeding of cereal grains or cereal flours or boiled cereal flour leads to acidosis with the symptoms of ruminal bloat, loose dung with a foul smell and undigested grains, laminitis and reproductive problem [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Tamil Nadu, rice is readily available at a low cost, hence, and is cooked (cooking akin to human consumption) and fed to cross-bred dairy cattle. Although the impact of feeding cooked rice on the incidence of the metabolic disorder is well known, the extent of incidence of acidosis and nutritional interventions required to combat it is not established.</p><p>Hence, a study was carried out with the objective to examine the prevalence of acidosis sequelae to rice-based feeding regimen and assess its magnitude.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study does not require the approval of the Institute Animal Ethics Committee.

Tamil Nadu state consists of 32 districts and from each district, two blocks were randomly selected and from each block, and five villages were randomly selected [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. From each of the selected village, 10 dairy farmers belonging to the unorganized sector, owning one or two crossbred dairy cattle, were selected through a stratified random sampling technique so that a sample size of 100 farmers per district was maintained. Cross-bred dairy cattle in milking stage from 1 to 7 months from these farmers formed the study material. All the animals were apparently free-form parasitic infestation, reared in a tropical environment at the backyard of farmer&#x02019;s residence and fed with palatable good quality feed ingredients free from exogenous contamination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>Randomly selected farmers feeding traditional feed which includes with or without cooked rice to their dairy cattle were individually contacted by the veterinarian to elicit information on the feeding regimen, milk yield and the occurrence of acidosis through a pre-tested structured questionnaire.</p><p>While the feeding regimen and milk yield data were recorded as per the farmer&#x02019;s declaration, the prevalence of acidosis was identified by the veterinarian by examining the animal for typical symptoms such as feces consistency and presence of undigested fiber/grain and gas bubbles and Laminitis [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Attempts to improve the feeding practices have met with little success due to the widespread nature of the problem and adoption of region-oriented traditional feeding practices [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further farmers share their staple food (cooked rice) with cows due to special religious sentiment, besides in Tamil Nadu, rice is available at a very subsidized cost to economically weaker sections, which also largely depend on cows for their survival. Hence, 71.5% of the unorganized dairy farmers feed cooked rice to their cattle. Cooked rice is fed alone or along with other feed ingredients, namely, other cereals, oil cakes, and rice bran [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] which is amply reflected in this survey.</p><p>The results of this survey (42.87% of dairy cattle produce &#x0003c;5 l of milk) correlate with the observation recorded [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in the unorganized farms, which indicated that majority of cattle are reared with unbalanced feeding regimen and consequently yield low milk lower than their genetic potential.</p><p>The overall incidence of acidosis (37.76%) in cross-bred dairy cattle fed with cooked rice recorded in this study concurred with the observations made else-where [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The incidence of ruminal acidosis due to the intake of a large amount of cooked rice and rice gruel has been reported in the neighboring country as well [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Rumen acidosis is associated with the feeding of diets with higher amounts of grain [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Feeding feeds rich in starch is the cause of ruminal acidosis in ruminants [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A very wet diet with highly fermented feeds is also prone to induce acidosis [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, the excessive amount of nonstructural carbohydrates with low neutral detergent fiber ingestion leads to acidosis [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Consumption of a large amount of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates, primarily starches, and sugars lead to ruminal acidosis [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In Bangladesh, it is reported that among the risk factors of ruminal acidosis, feeding of cooked rice was highest (50% and 62.5% in cattle and goats, respectively) followed by feeding of rice gruel (25%) and feeding jackfruit residue, potato, and bread each by 12.5% [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Cooked rice has rapidly fermentable starch and less protein which leads to the production of short-chain volatile fatty acids and lactic acid in the rumen [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The available carbohydrate in rice is reported to be 71.1% [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] whereas it is recommended not to exceed 36% in a feed containing rapidly digestible starch. It is advocated to provide adequate degradable protein to ferment available carbohydrate in the ration to increase microbial protein production and reduces the fermentation of energy to acids [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and thereby reducing the risk of acidosis [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Excess feeding of cereal grains or cereal flours or boiled cereal flour leads to Subacute Ruminal Acidosis, which requires the synchronized release of nitrogen to divert carbon and hydrogen present in the fermentable organic matter to synthesize microbial protein [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ruminal acidosis is defined as a fermentation disorder in the rumen characterized by a lower than normal ruminal pH, reflecting an imbalance between microbial production, microbial utilization, and ruminal absorption of volatile fatty acids [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Further, the noticeable difference in the incidence of acidosis observed between feeding cooked rice and those not fed with cooked rice and limited intake of oil cake indicates that there is a mismatch between energy and protein supply to these cattle apart from undernourishment of nutrients [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This indicates that a source of nitrogen needs to be supplemented for energy protein synchrony to augment microbial biomass production [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A major energy source of organic matter is carbohydrate and nitrogen can be non-protein nitrogen sources or protein sources from oil cakes for microbial protein synthesis [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Acidosis can be prevented by feeding management such as reducing the high grain diet and feeding adequate quantity of crude protein with energy for effective utilization of nutrients in the rumen [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The incidence rate of laminitis from surveys concurs with the reports that ranged from 5.5% to 30% [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nutritional management has been identified as a key component in the development of laminitis, particularly the feeding of diets high in fermentable carbohydrates, which can result in an acidotic state. The lactic acid and the endotoxins and histamine released as the rumen flora die are absorbed systemically and affect the microvasculature of the growing hoof wall, which can then result in clinical laminitis [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The survey report indicates that more than two-thirds of farmers in unorganized sector feed cooked rice and majority of them feed 0.5-1 kg per day per cow in Tamil Nadu. The incidence of acidosis (37.76%) and consequently laminitis ranging from 9.2% to 37.9% are widely prevalent in cooked rice-based feeding regimen and are more pronounced (p&#x0003c;0.05) as the quantity of cooked rice increase. Cooked rice-based feeding regimen with low quantity and quality of crude protein as practiced by farmer leads to a mismatch of energy and protein and consequently acidosis in dairy cattle. The study points out the importance of protein supplementation in rice-based feeding regimen to set right the mismatched supply between nitrogen and fermentable organic matter in the rumen.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>All the authors conceptualized the manuscript.
