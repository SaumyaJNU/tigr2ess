    "This work evaluated the effectiveness of rice straw pretreatment using a TiO₂/UV system in the presence of oxidants. The effects of TiO₂ concentrations, pH and photocatalysis time were investigated. Inorganic oxidants including H₂O2, K₂S₂O₈, and KIO₄ were added to further enhance the effect on enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw. The TiO₂/UV/ H₂O₂ pretreatment showed a higher amount of released reducing sugar (8.88 ± 0.10 mg/mL, compared to 5.47 ± 0.03 mg/mL in untreated sample). Composition analyses of rice straw after the TiO₂/UV/H₂O₂ pretreatment showed partial lignin and hemicellulose removal. Moreover, structural features of untreated and pretreated rice straw were analyzed through FE-SEM, FT-IR, and XRD. This work suggests that H₂O₂ is an efficient addition for photocatalysis pretreatment of rice straw."
