    "The dataset explicates farmer×³s perceptions about fertilizer subsidy policy in Bangladesh and the factors that affect farm level fertilizer usage. Primary data were collected from 300 farm households from three regions of the country belonging to four farm size groups i.e., marginal, small, medium and large. Dataset reveals that a major part of sampled marginal farmers was unaware that government is providing huge subsidy on the fertilizer market. Most of the marginal farmers were dissatisfied claiming the uneven distribution of subsidy benefit whereas majority of large farmers were satisfied with current policy and market prices. At the same time, output prices relative to fertilizer price received by the farmers, off-farm income and extension services were significantly affecting fertilizer use intensity of different farm size groups while subsidy policy impact was not significant."
