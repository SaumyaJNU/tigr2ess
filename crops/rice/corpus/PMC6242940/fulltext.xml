Despite many methodological advances, the utilization of plants in pottery has been difficult to demonstrate chemically, hindering the study of their role in ancient society, a&#x000a0;topic that is especially important to understanding early agricultural practices at the start of the Neolithic period. Here, we present the first lipid residue study on the Chinese Neolithic pottery dated to 5.0&#x02009;k - 4.7&#x02009;k cal BC from the Tianluoshan site, Zhejiang province, a key site with early evidence for rice domestication. Through the identification of novel molecular biomarkers and extensive stable isotope analysis, we suggest that the pottery in Tianluoshan were largely used for processing starchy plant foods. These results not only highlight the significance of starchy plants in Neolithic southern China but also show a clear difference with other contemporary sites in northern Eurasia, where pottery is clearly orientated to aquatic resource exploitation. These differences may be linked with the early development of rice agriculture in China compared to its much later adoption in adjacent northerly regions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05969</award-id><award-id>17H04777</award-id><award-id>15H05969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Shinichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>EC | European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IIF 624467: PONTE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000267</institution-id><institution>Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AH/L00691X/1</award-id><award-id>AH/L00691X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lucquin</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Oliver E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Plants have played an important role in shaping human history that extends back well beyond their domestication to our more distant forager ancestors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, methodologies for evaluating how plants were utilized in the past and their relationship to prehistoric material culture is still developing and has been largely restricted to the microscopic identification of plant remains adhering to the surfaces of lithic tools or grinding stones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and occasionally on pottery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. An alternative and extremely promising avenue of research has been the chemical determination of organic residues associated with artefacts. This approach has been widely deployed to identify the original contents of prehistoric pottery vessels used for cooking, storage and serving foods and in the production of other natural materials, such as waxes and adhesives. For the former, organic residue analysis has mainly focused on the identification of fatty animal products, oil rich seeds, and plant and insect waxes through the isotopic and molecular characterisation of preserved lipids which are particularly rich in these products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Conversely, the identification of more starchy plant foods has been much harder to demonstrate with the suspicion, backed in part by experimental evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, that they leave little or no trace during cooking. This is unfortunate given that elucidating the early role and eventual dependence on starchy crops is a key theme in world prehistory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">It is unlikely that starchy plant food, such as cereals, were simply not used in pottery. Agriculture and pottery frequently co-occurred and both were key elements of many early farming societies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Similarly, starchy wild tubers and nuts were likely to have been important to pottery producing hunter-gatherers. Indeed the need to detoxify starch rich plants has been cited as a motivation for the invention of pottery and it would also seem logical that starchy foods would have needed to be processed prior to consumption, particularly to aid digestion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Linking the utilization of cultivated grains directly with one of the most common forms of material culture recovered in archaeological sites (i.e. pottery) would have immense benefits for examining the dispersal of important crops and for examining their early culinary significance.</p><p id="Par4">To date, the evidence for processing starchy plants in pottery is extremely sparse, with the most promising studies relating to the identification of lipid biomarkers for millet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Both of these are C<sub>4</sub> crops and therefore have relatively enriched carbon isotope ratios compared to wild C3 plants, permitting further distinction. It has also been shown that early Holocene pottery from the Libyan Sahara was used by hunter-gatherers for processing plant materials by the identification of lipids consistent with seed oils from local wild plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Yet the routine identification of the most important domesticated C<sub>3</sub> cereal crops, such as rice, wheat and barley in pottery, has been much more challenging. Recently, biomarkers for wheat and barley (alkylresorcinols) have been identified in Roman vessels buried in anoxic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and an exceptionally well preserved Early Bronze Age wooden container from an Alpine glacier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> but it is not known whether these compounds survive routinely in archaeological pottery. Similarly it is unclear whether extensive processing of wild starchy plants such as acorns or chestnuts would be detectable in pottery residues, although diagnostic compounds have been identified in charred deposits associated with storage pits from Japanese hunter-gatherer contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we investigate the potential for identification of starchy plants at the Tianluoshan site in the Lower Yangtze river basin in Zhejiang Province, China; a waterlogged site that has preserved a remarkable assemblage of plant remains, including rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), foxnuts (<italic>Euryale ferox</italic>), water chestnuts (<italic>Trapa spp</italic>.) and acorns (<italic>Lithocarpus spp</italic>. and <italic>Cyclobalanopsis spp</italic>.). The site is particularly significant as the sequence captures the early stages of rice domestication, ca. 5,000 - 4,000 cal BC as this crop gradually replaced wild foraged foods to become an important staple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the role that pottery played in this transition is unclear. Pottery production in China, as in most other regions of East Asia, predates agriculture by several thousand years with the earliest assemblages dating to the Late Glacial Maximum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> in the South. Indeed, analysis of hunter-gatherer pottery from Japan (Jomon) and Korea (Chulmun), shows a clear preference for processing of aquatic foods and surprisingly little evidence for plant processing despite the widespread availability of wild plant resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In Japan there seems to be little change in the use of pottery at the start of the Holocene when the scale of production dramatically increases, and forest products are more abundant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Even at later Jomon sites, with abundant evidence for intensive plant processing, pottery seems to have been used for processing fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, in Japan there is no suggestion of cereal agriculture until much later at the Jomon-Yayoi cultural transition (ca. 800 cal BC). In China the situation is quite different as rice and millet are claimed to have been domesticated at the beginning of Holocene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> concomitant with increases in the scale of pottery production. Our study therefore provides an opportunity to investigate whether Holocene pottery in China followed a similar trajectory to other regions of East Asia or whether pottery was associated with the processing of wild and domesticated plants (i.e. rice).</p><p id="Par7">To tackle this question, organic residue analysis was undertaken on pottery from the early phases of the Tianluoshan archaeological site (30&#x000b0;01&#x02032;N 121&#x000b0;22&#x02032;E, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) dating to Early Holocene (5.2&#x02009;k to 4.7&#x02009;k calBC, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The potsherds were stored in the on-site museum of Tianluoshan, after they were excavated (2010&#x02013;2013) from the cultural layers. Ceramic powder samples were taken from upper body or rim of <italic>Fu</italic> type boiler (rim diameter; 17.9&#x02013;33.9 cm), while adhering charred surface deposit (hereafter foodcrusts) samples were taken from the interior wall of the upper and bottom sherds of pottery. The ceramic vessels were excavated from the cultural layers along with densely spaced wooden structures, indicative of a settlement, most likely representing therefore domestic pottery use.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Map showing the location of Tianluoshan and other East Asian Early Holocene sites referred to in the text.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_35227_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e498"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">We conducted three independent lines of analysis to investigate pottery use at Tianluoshan.

At the comparator sites with relatively higher &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N compared to Tianluoshan, it is clear that residues are derived from charred aquatic foods as lipid biomarkers for heated marine and freshwater oils were detected in many of these samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Instead, the Tianluoshan foodcrusts are comparable with values obtained from charred plant remains, including rice from this region.

However, as other charred plant materials and potentially residues from terrestrial animals also overlap with this range, it is impossible to distinguish a plant input using this approach alone. The isotope values are in general higher than charred plant remains from the middle/late Jomon pre-agricultural site of Sannai Maruyama in Japan which are thought to be derived from wild forest products, such as acorns and chestnuts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Bulk isotope characteristics of charred deposits on pottery (foodcrusts) and charred plant remains in East Asia.

These are characterised by lower &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values, the presence of sugars, including the degradation products of starch/cellulose, a relatively high abundance of plant sterols and APAAs derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Together, the molecular evidence shows that plant foods were cooked/heated in pottery during the Early Neolithic at this site given that the compounds identified are thermal degradation products of more labile precursors.</p><p id="Par15">As Tianluoshan has been closely linked with early rice domestication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, it is tempting to interpret the organic residue data as evidence of processing this important commodity. If so, our findings would imply that rice was common culinary commodity used in utilitarian cooking pots shortly after its domestication. Certainly, the organic data are consistent with degraded rice as a major component of many of the residues, however it is important to note the presence of other wild starchy plants present in the archaeobotanical assemblage, such as acorns, foxnuts and water chestnuts. These wild foods cannot be ruled out, particularly as these were important foodstuffs in their own right and are even considered to be &#x02018;cultivated&#x02019; at this time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Acorns in particular seem to be one of the staple foods at Tianluoshan especially in the earlier phases of the site. Grinding stones were largely absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> so boiling nuts and acorns in ceramic vessels to remove toxic tannic and gallic acids would have offered an alternative strategy to render them edible.</p><p id="Par16">Fishing also was an important subsistence activity at Tianluoshan, shown by the recovery of large quantities of freshwater fish bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> as well as marine fish, such as tuna, shark, grouper and whale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, yet the evidence for processing fish in pottery was very limited as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> with the low occurrence of sample with APAA(C<sub>20</sub>). Although the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C values of many of the Tianluoshan samples are as depleted as freshwater resources reference material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the identification of levoglucosan confirms they are more likely derived from plant resources. As with other East Asian sites, pottery at Tianluoshan viewed as an &#x02018;all purpose&#x02019; artefact but rather had a restricted range of uses. Importantly, however, the culinary preference at this site was for processing starchy plant foods in pottery whereas at coeval sites in Japan and Korea pottery use was strongly orientated towards aquatic products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, with little evidence for plant derived compounds despite extensive analysis. The fact that rice cultivation was beginning to be practiced in China at this time whereas contemporary sites in Japan and Korea were occupied by hunter-gatherers may explain this difference although secure identification of rice in the Tianluoshan ceramics is needed to confirm, and the difference might simply be related to separate culinary traditions.</p><p id="Par17">The pattern observed at Tianluoshan also contrasts sharply with pottery use by Western Eurasian early farmers where ruminant dairy and meat products tend to dominate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In Western Eurasia pottery spread along with domesticated animals and plants making a clear &#x02018;Neolithic&#x02019; horizon whereas in China pottery and farming followed separate trajectories. There is a long history of pottery use by hunter-gatherers with the earliest vessels dating back to 18&#x02009;ka cal BC in the South China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> long before plant and animal domestication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The tradition of processing of starchy plants in pottery, including varieties of wild rice, might date back to ceramic producing hunter-gatherers of this region, in-keeping with the long-term process of domestication of this crop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Of the starchy foods available, why rice came to become such an important staple regionally and subsequently the world&#x02019;s most important food crop is a key question and still the subject of much debate among archaeobotanists and geneticists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Further molecular work to securely identify rice in pottery, perhaps using protein-based approaches, could greatly contribute to this question by providing knowledge of the cultural significance and culinary uses of the crop during the early stages of its domestication and in relation to other wild foods. A residue approach would also allow the dispersal of the crop to be traced through regions where there is an absence of archaeobotanical evidence. The data presented here provide the first evidence of pottery use at an early rice domestication site and, while it was not possible to identify this product securely, they should at the very least provide a useful comparator for further studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Heating/Cooking Experiment</title><p id="Par18">Experiments were carried out to determine whether organic residues are formed through rice processing, and if so the types of compounds that are formed.
