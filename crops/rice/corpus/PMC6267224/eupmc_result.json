    "The azuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis L.) is an insect pest responsible for serious postharvest seed loss in leguminous crops. In this study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of seed resistance to C. chinensis in moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia [Jaqc.] Maréchal). An F₂ population of 188 plants developed by crossing resistant accession 'TN67' (wild type from India; male parent) and susceptible accession 'IPCMO056' (cultivated type from India; female parent) was used for mapping. Seeds of the F₂ population from 2014 and F2:₃ populations from 2016 and 2017 were bioassayed with C. chinensis, and the percentage of damaged seeds and progress of infestation severity were measured. Segregation analysis suggested that C. chinensis resistance in TN176 is controlled by a single dominant gene, designated as Rcc. QTL analysis revealed one principal and one modifying QTL for the resistance, named qVacBrc2.1 and qVacBrc5.1, respectively. qVacBrc2.1 was located on linkage group 2 between simple sequence repeat markers CEDG261 and DMB-SSR160 and accounted for 50.41% to 64.23% of resistance-related traits, depending on the trait and population. Comparative genomic analysis suggested that qVacBrc2.1 is the same as QTL Brc2.1 conferring C. chinensis resistance in wild azuki bean (V. nepalensis Tateishi and Maxted). Markers CEDG261 and DMB-SSR160 should be useful for marker-assisted selection for C. chinensis resistance in moth bean."
