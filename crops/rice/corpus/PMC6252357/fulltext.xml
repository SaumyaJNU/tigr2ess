Based on the grain yield (YLD) of plants in normal field and plants in low P field, 27 gain of function (high-YLD represented as hy) and 9 loss of function (low-YLD represented as ly) mutants were selected and compared with N22 for physiological and genotyping studies. In low P field, hy mutants showed higher P concentration in roots, leaves, grains, and in the whole plant than in ly mutants at harvest. In low P conditions, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub> were 24% higher in hy mutants than in ly mutants. In comparison with ly mutants, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the roots and leaves of hy mutants in low P fields was 9% and 41% higher at the vegetative stage, respectively, but 51% and 14% lower in the roots and leaves at the reproductive stage, respectively. However, in comparison with ly mutants, the catalase (CAT) activity in the roots and leaves of hy mutants in low P fields was 35% higher at the vegetative stage and 15% and 17% higher at the reproductive stage, respectively. Similarly, hy mutants in low P field showed 20% and 80% higher peroxidase (POD) activity in the roots and leaves at the vegetative stage, respectively, but showed 14% and 16% lower POD activity at the reproductive stage in the roots and leaves, respectively. Marker trait association analysis using 48 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 10 <italic>Pup1</italic> gene markers showed that RM3648 and RM451 in chromosome 4 were significantly associated with grain YLD, tiller number (TN), SOD, and POD activities in both the roots and leaves in low P conditions only. Similarly, RM3334 and RM6300 in chromosome 5 were associated with CAT activity in leaves in low P conditions. Notably, grain YLD was positively and significantly correlated with CAT activity in the roots and shoots, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub> in low P conditions, and the shoots&#x02019; P concentration and q<sub>N</sub> in normal conditions. Furthermore, CAT activity in shoots was positively and significantly correlated with TN in both low P and normal conditions. Thus, chromosomal regions and physiological traits that have a role in imparting tolerance to low P in the field were identified.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>upland rice variety</kwd><kwd>EMS-induced mutants</kwd><kwd>low P condition</kwd><kwd>antioxidant enzymes</kwd><kwd><italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> test</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001407</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">(BT/PR-9264/AGR/02/406(04)/2007)</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="13"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="38"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Factors influencing crop growth and productivity, nutrients being the most important, are applied in the form of fertilizers. Among these nutrients, phosphorus (P), secondary to nitrogen (N), plays an essential role in plant growth. Phosphorus fixation is a common problem in the soils of rice fields (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Krishnamurthy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Panigrahy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Vandamme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yugandhar et al., 2018a</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The applied P is not completely available to plants because of slow diffusion rates and processes such as fixation in alkaline soils with Ca and fixation in acidic soils with Fe and Al. For the farming community, P fertilizers are costly and difficult to access, which cause major concerns for rice cultivation in India and other rice growing countries. Phosphorus fertilizer production is largely dependent on rock phosphate, a nonrenewable resource, and this finite source of P is under the threat of exhaustion.</p><p>Low P availability reduces plant height (PH), tiller number (TN), and yield (YLD) attributes such as the number of panicles, grains per panicle, filled grains per panicle, and higher spikelet sterility, thus limiting plant productivity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>). Increase of root acid phosphatase is one of the most common responses to low P conditions, which help plants to hydrolyze organic P into inorganic P and enhance the availability of P to plants (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Mehra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2017</xref>). For this reason, there is a need to develop genotypes that can produce an acceptable grain YLD under low P conditions. In India, the availability of P in most of the cultivated soils is becoming either low or extremely poor (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sanyal et al., 2015</xref>), particularly in upland soils.</p><p>Phosphate deprivation lowers the leaf photosynthetic oxygen evolution, photosystem II quantum efficiency, and electron transport (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules under normal physiological conditions and play a vital role in signal transduction. Exposure of plants to low P conditions triggers an increased generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) or ROS such as O<sup>2-</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and OH<sup>-</sup> radicals, which are cytotoxic and disrupt the normal metabolism through oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, leading to oxidative stress. To manage these ROS outbreaks, plants have evolved intricate antioxidant defense systems, consisting of detoxifying or ROS scavenging enzymatic antioxidants, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and non-enzymatic antioxidants, namely glutathione, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, &#x003b1;-tocopherol, and flavonoids. In rice root tissues, the activities of these three scavenging enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) are affected by phosphate deficiency (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Juszczuk et al., 2001</xref>). Decreased photosynthetic efficiency was reported in low P field conditions, in crops such as rice (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>), wheat (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 1998</xref>), and soybean (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Lauer et al., 1989</xref>). <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al. (2017)</xref> have screened four rice genotypes for antioxidant enzyme activities in 0, 15, 30, 45,and 60 kg/ha of applied P in soil and found that higher CAT activity in the rice cultivar Swarna at the flowering stage led to higher grain YLD in low P conditions. <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al. (2016)</xref> reported that P deprivation led to a significant increase in POD and CAT activities in 18-day-old rice hydroponically grown seedlings.</p><p>Nagina22, a deep-rooted upland rice variety, tolerant to various biotic and abiotic stresses, was subjected to ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations. For characterization, 85,000 EMS-induced mutants were generated and maintained under a multi-institutional program (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Mithra et al., 2016</xref>). Mutants for abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, low-P tolerance, and herbicide resistance were identified (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Poli et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017a</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mohapatra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Panigrahy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Talla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shoba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Yugandhar et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we evaluated different physiological and biochemical traits, including the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the roots and leaves as well as fluorescence parameters in flag leaves. The 27 gain of function (high-YLD represented as hy) and 9 loss of function (low-YLD represented as ly) mutants were compared with N22 and Jaya under normal as well as low P conditions to identify traits that can distinguish hy and ly mutants in low P conditions.

The concentration varied from 0.209 to 2.76 (mg/g DW) in hy mutants and from 0.11 to 0.193 (mg/g DW) in ly mutants. Similarly, in hy mutants, P concentrations were 31% higher in shoots and 39% higher in grains, when compared with those condition in ly mutants in low P conditions.

Higher P concentration in roots, shoots, and grains eventually led to higher total P concentration in hy mutants. The total P concentration ranged from 1.66 to 4.376 (mg/g DW) in hy mutants and 1.04 to 1.284 (mg/g DW) in ly mutants in low P conditions.

However, the SOD activity was negatively correlated with the CAT activity in roots. In hy mutants, a significant positive correlation was observed between the CAT activity in the roots and shoots, but a negative correlation was observed between the CAT activity in roots, POD activity in roots, and the SOD activity in leaves at normal conditions.

The first two PCs showed a cumulative proportion of 93% of the variation, under combined analysis. In low P conditions, the PCA showed that SOD shoots (SS), POD shoots (PS), SOD roots (SR), and PR are the key factors/traits that contribute to low P tolerance and differentiate the mutants as tolerant and sensitive. The cumulative proportion of the first two PCs was 69%. The PS, PR, SS, and SR were captured by PC1 and YLD and TN were captured by PC2. The PCA in normal conditions showed that YLD, TN and SS are the key traits that differentiate the mutants into different groups. The cumulative proportion of the first two PCs was only 40%. YLD, TN, and SS were primarily captured by PC1 and CR and PR were captured by PC2. The PCA also showed a random distribution of genotypes in normal conditions, but clustering was observed in low P conditions.

Phosphorus, a macronutrient, is required for rice cultivation in large amounts. To tackle the problem of P deficiency, identification and development of rice genotypes that can produce higher YLD even in low P soil is a viable approach.</p><p>Field testing and screening of 137 mutants, along with N22, was carried out in low P conditions to identify hy mutants that could perform better than N22. Mutants with heat and low P tolerance were identified in field experiments in previous studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Poli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Panigrahy et al., 2014</xref>). Mutants with higher mean YLD/hill than N22 were categorized as hy mutants and those with lower mean YLD/hill than N22 were categorized as ly mutants in low P conditions. The mutants were selected for further screening based on the YLD/hill in low P conditions, and the other traits such as TN/hill and PH were not considered. It was noted from a previous study that although some mutants had a higher TN, they failed to flower; similarly, mutants that had more PH achieved a poor YLD in low P conditions.</p><p>Phenotyping of 36 mutants for PH, TN, and YLD/plant showed that hy mutants are more responsive to P and also showed a significant variation between both conditions. The hy mutants showed a range of variations in their phenotypic expression in low P and normal conditions. Across two test environments, NH1576 (TN) and NH1491 and NH1427 (YLD), the TN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and YLD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) showed a low range of variation, compared with other mutants. These mutants, showing stable YLD performance across different environments, could be tested under multilocation trials to develop low P tolerant varieties.</p><p>Low P conditions trigger increased production of ROS in plants. Antioxidant machinery comprising enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) and others are produced as defense molecules to neutralize the ROS, whose uncontrolled production could have a devastating impact at the cellular level on the plant. Most studies on the effect of low P conditions on antioxidant systems were carried out in hydroponics (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2014</xref>), and there are very few reports of the same in soil conditions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the impact of low P soil on the antioxidant enzyme activity in the roots and leaves at both vegetative and reproductive stages of selected hy and ly mutants.</p><p>Enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT) act as a coping strategy to scavenge ROS (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Gilliham, 2015</xref>). Overexpression of genes involved in ROS detoxification resulted in lower cellular damage and the maintenance of photosynthetic energy capture under saline conditions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unknown whether ROS detoxification occurred because of low P stress. In a previous study, 8-day-old seedlings of an indica cultivar Zhenong 966 were subjected to minus (-) P conditions in hydroponics for 16 days. Both SOD and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in leaves were significantly higher in -P than in plus (+) P. The parameters <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub> were also reduced significantly in -P (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). In another study, Huanghuazhan, an indica cultivar was used to study the effect of -P conditions in hydroponics for 18 days. Antioxidant enzymes, namely SOD, POD, CAT, APX, and GR, were estimated in leaves, and it was concluded that the SOD and CAT activities were significantly higher in -P when compared with +P conditions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiment was designed to decipher the activity of antioxidant enzymes in low P field in both the vegetative and reproductive stages as well as in the roots and leaves. <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al. (2017)</xref> screened four rice varieties with different P levels in pot experiments up to maturity: Swarna and Akhanphou were tolerant to low P, and MTU1010 and RPBio 226 were sensitive to low P. Antioxidant enzymes were assayed at the reproductive stage with different P levels. The research team concluded that the SOD, POD, and CAT activities were significantly higher in low P conditions for all the genotypes. In tolerant varieties, the higher CAT activity when accompanied with higher <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> resulted in higher grain YLD in low P conditions. In our experiment, we estimated antioxidant enzymes both at the vegetative and reproductive stages in 27 hy and 9 ly mutants of N22 in low P conditions. Antioxidant enzyme activity and photosynthesis showed association with YLD under low P condition but not in normal condition.</p><p>In the vegetative stage, elevated SOD and CAT activities in both the roots and leaves of all hy mutants and higher POD activity in ly mutants were observed in low P conditions. Whereas, at the reproductive stage, hy mutants exhibited lower SOD and POD activities but a higher CAT activity in comparison with ly mutants in both the roots and shoots. These results clearly indicate that hy mutants possessed higher SOD and CAT activities at the early stages and a higher CAT activity at the reproductive stage in both the roots and shoots for scavenging the increased ROS levels in low P conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, ly mutants had a higher POD activity but lower SOD and CAT activities and were therefore less efficient in scavenging the ROS at the early stages. In ly mutants, a higher POD activity may not be adequate to remove H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as rapidly as CAT (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alam and Ghosh, 2018</xref>). This is likely to result in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules. It was reported that 10 &#x003bc;M of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is sufficient to inhibit 50% of photosynthesis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser, 1979</xref>). Therefore, for the survival of ly mutant plants in low P conditions, a high POD activity alone is insufficient to confer low P tolerance. A higher SOD activity combined with a higher CAT activity at the vegetative stage and a higher CAT activity at the reproductive stage seems to be important for scavenging the increased ROS levels under low P conditions. This may be one of the reasons for better survival and higher YLD of hy mutants under low P conditions.</p><p>In the vegetative stage, under low P conditions, in response to the accumulation of ROS, the activity of SOD was increased in both hy and ly mutants that resulted in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The hy mutants showed overall lower antioxidant activity only at the reproductive stage when compared with ly mutants. It is important to note that in low P conditions, the SOD activity was higher in hy mutants than in ly mutants at the vegetative stage, and correspondingly the CAT activity was also higher in hy mutants than in ly mutants at the vegetative stage; so, the ROS were effectively scavenged. However, at the critical reproductive stage, CAT activity in ly mutants could not match with the increased SOD activity. Additionally, CAT activity was increasingly efficient in neutralizing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when compared with POD activity. The POD activity could keep pace with increased SOD in both hy and ly mutants; so, we concluded that the difference is not due to POD but due to CAT at the reproductive stage. In hy mutants under low P conditions, grain YLD was positively and significantly correlated only with CAT in roots and shoots but not with POD and SOD at the reproductive stage. The hy mutants exhibited higher P concentration in roots, shoots, and grains when compared with ly mutants in low P conditions, suggesting that hy mutants had better P uptake and transport mechanisms that helped the mutants to thrive under low P conditions. This may be one of the reasons for the better survival and YLD of hy mutants under low P conditions.</p><p>From a physiological point of view, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> that represents the PSII photochemistry was reduced under low P conditions, but it was higher in hy mutants than in ly mutants. The hy mutants also had a higher q<sub>N</sub> that indicated that excessive excitation energy was lost in the form of heat and minimized the damage caused to photosystem II (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>). The hy mutants had higher SOD and CAT activities at the vegetative stage followed by a higher CAT activity at the reproductive stage. Besides, they also had higher <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub> that indicated that the deleterious effect of low P conditions on PSII mechanism was less in hy mutants. Overall, higher <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub>; qN; and P concentrations in roots, shoots, and grains could probably be the factors promoting hy mutants to cope with the adverse effects of low P conditions. In our study, hy mutants had more CAT activity under low P conditions that resulted in higher <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub>, which favored these mutants for better survival and seed set. On the other hand, in ly mutants, a higher SOD activity at both the stages enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. However, CAT activity in ly mutants was less at both stages, which resulted in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that inhibited photosynthesis and, thus, reduced grain YLD under low P conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>).</p><fig id="F13" position="float"><label>FIGURE 13</label><caption><p>Model diagram of the influence of higher and lower CAT activities on grain yield.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01543-g013"/></fig><p>Catalase is the most efficient enzyme, which neutralizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Mhamdi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Veronica et al., 2017</xref>), and Kcat of CAT was the highest among all the antioxidant enzymes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). This study indicated that low P stress reduces <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> in rice, however, mutations in N22 enhanced (in case of hy mutants) or decreased (in case of ly mutants) the activity of CAT, which facilitated the lower reduction of <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> in hy mutants as compared with ly mutants. This in turn might be an important factor that led to the higher YLD of hy mutants in low P conditions. It would be interesting to further probe into the effects of antioxidants and ROS pathways in low-P tolerance to establish a link between P metabolism and ROS pathways. It can also facilitate developing a ROS based biomarker to identify the genotypes for low-P tolerance in rice. The N22 mutants analyzed in this study are an important genetic resource for carrying out further analyses in this area of research.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the first five components accounted for 99.47% of the total variation and morphological traits like PH, YLD, and TN showing high coefficient values in PC1 (79.1%), indicating their major contribution in discriminating accessions, while the remaining variables had weak or no discriminatory power. In contrast, under low P conditions, PCs up to PC5 exhibited 90.17% variation with TN showing the highest coefficient along with SR, YLD, and PR, explaining the variance. TN is used as a surrogate for measuring tolerance to low-P conditions (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wissuwa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Panigrahy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Poli et al., 2017a</xref>). These results, therefore, indicate the impact of antioxidant enzymes in differentiating the genotypes under conditions of stress. Even the pooled analysis has shown that POD and SOD activities in roots contributed more toward differentiating genotypes than the morphological traits with high Eigen values for the first PC and indicated the need to identify and improve genotypes with these factors, for better tolerance under conditions of stress. Multivariate analyses conducted from the biochemical and morphological data of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from contrasting parents, N22 and IR 64, under drought stress also resolved the significant effect of biochemical factors in differentiating tolerant and sensitive lines, and they found that enzyme-morphology correlations were not significant under irrigated control but were significant in conditions of drought. The researchers concluded that GR had a significant and positive correlation with single plant YLD (SPY) under drought stress but not in normal conditions (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Prakash et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Loci RM3648 and RM451 showed significant association with YLD, TN, and SOD and POD activities in both the roots and leaves in low P conditions only. RM3334 and RM3600 were associated with only CAT activity in leaves in low P conditions. The closest genes flanking RM3688 is the oryzain alpha chain precursor (LOC_Os04g55650.1), which is located 5 kb downstream. The gene closest to RM451 is the SNF2 family N-terminal domain containing protein (LOC_Os04g47830.1), which is located 1 kb upstream. RM334 is close to the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 28 (LOC_Os05g02130.1), which is located just 124 bp upstream. Close to RM6300 is the mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim17 (LOC_Os05g02060.1), which is located 116 bp downstream. Interestingly, all four genes have a known relationship with antioxidants and are good candidates for establishing a functional link between ROS and low-P tolerance in future studies.</p><p>This is the first report to show physiological and biochemical traits together, studying several genotypes (36 mutants + 2 control&#x02013;N22 and Jaya) in low and normal P conditions, at different growth stages and tissues. Furthermore, the SOD, POD, and CAT activities in the roots and leaves at two stages of crop growth, vegetative and reproductive, as well as the fluorescence parameters, <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> and q<sub>N</sub>, at the reproductive stage were analyzed. Higher SOD and CAT activities at the vegetative stage and a higher CAT activity and <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> at the reproductive stage are important traits that confer tolerance to low P conditions. This was supported by the high correlation coefficients between SOD and CAT activities at the vegetative stage and CAT activity with grain YLD and <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> at the reproductive stage, particularly in low P conditions. We have also shown markers associated (RM3648, RM451, RM3334, and RM3600) with antioxidant enzymes, especially in low P conditions. From this study, the useful chlorophyll fluorescence, antioxidant enzymes, and associated markers were identified, which can be useful for the development of low P tolerant genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SN, SV, SD, SM, and DB designed the research work.
