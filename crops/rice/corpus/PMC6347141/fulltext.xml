However, the effects of long-term fertilization on microbial-mediated carbon mineralization are poorly understood. To identify the relative roles of microbes in carbon mineralization of yellow paddies, we investigated the long-term fertilization effects on soil properties and microbial communities and their relationships with carbon mineralization. The treatments included: no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), organic fertilizer (M), and constant organic-inorganic fertilizer (MNPK). NPK treatment significantly increased soil water content (WC), while M and MNPK treatments significantly increased the content of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (SMBN), and WC. Strong increases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, potential mineralized carbon, and turnover rate constant were observed in both organic-fertilizer treatments (M and MNPK), relative to the CK treatment. These changes in soil properties can be attributed to the variation in microbial communities. NPK treatment had no significant effect. Different fertilization treatments changed soil microbial community; SOC and SMBN were the most important contributors to the variance in microbial community composition. The variations in community composition did not significant influence carbon mineralization; however, carbon mineralization was significantly influenced by the abundance of several non-dominant bacteria. The results suggest that SOC, SMBN, and non-dominant bacteria (<italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Latescibacteria</italic>), have a close relationship to carbon mineralization, and should be preferentially considered in predicting carbon mineralization under long-term fertilization.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Open Fundation of Chang&#x02019;an University Key Laboratory of Land Rehabilitation of Shaanxi Provincial</institution></funding-source><award-id>2018-JC18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>31860160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by The Open Fundation of Chang&#x02019;an University Key Laboratory of Land Rehabilitation of Shaanxi Provincial (2018-JC18) and The National Natural Science Foundation of China (31860160).

The carbon in soil organic matter is about three times the carbon storage of terrestrial vegetation [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and a large proportion of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the world comes from decomposition of soil organic matter [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The International Panel on Climate change (IPCC) [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported that agriculture is an important terrestrial ecosystem with the potential to mitigate the greenhouse effect. The natural potential of global agricultural greenhouse gas emission reduction is as high as 2300&#x02013;6400 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per year, and more than 90% comes from reducing soil CO<sub>2</sub> release. In the last 100 years, the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations caused by irrational farming practices and the massive burning of fossil fuels has changed the dynamic balance of carbon in the atmosphere [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The global surface temperature is expected to rise by 1.8&#x02013;4.0 &#x000b0;C by the end of this century. Therefore, the study of soil organic carbon mineralization and its influencing factors has become one of the hot issues in global climate change.</p><p>Fertilization is a necessary agricultural farming method. Different fertilization methods lead to differences in soil nutrients, pH, and microbial species, which in turn affect the transformation and decomposition of organic carbon by soil microorganisms and, ultimately, greenhouse gas emissions from farmland [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Microbes are the main players in soil biochemical processes, and their abundance, activity, and composition are often closely related to soil organic carbon mineralization processes [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The application of chemical fertilizer has increased crop yield. For instance, Dai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have shown that the long-term omission of N and P fertilizer significantly reduced wheat and maize yields, but chemical fertilizer also affects the biochemical processes of soil microbes. According to Eo and Park [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], long-term use of chemical fertilizers causes changes in bacterial community composition. For instance, Eo and Park [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrated that the <italic>Chloroflexi</italic> and <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> Phyla were negatively affected by chemical fertilization. Leff et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also showed that N and P in fertilizers caused shifts in microbial communities. On the other hand, Lee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that the application of chemical fertilizers had no significant effect on soil microbial biomass carbon and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which is primarily driven by microorganism composition, consistent with the results of Wagai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, Dai et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that long-term application of chemical fertilizers can effectively increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and is not directly related to soil microbial communities.</p><p>Regarding treatment with organic fertilizers, Grunwald et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Ribeiro et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that the application of organic fertilizer promotes the rapid release of nutrients and significantly increases the mineralization of carbon pools. Organic carbon mineralization stems mainly from the decomposition of activated carbon pool components. Soil microbial biomass carbon and potential mineralized carbon are characterized by easy oxidation, easy decomposition, and easy mineralization. Soil microbial biomass carbon accounts for a small proportion of the soil organic carbon, which is more sensitive to the changes in soil quality and productivity than the total organic carbon [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Garcia-Pausas and Paterson [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that the mineralization of organic carbon was closely related to the community composition and abundance of microorganisms. Ramirez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that different fertilization treatments significantly change the composition of soil microbial communities, and lead to changes in the major bacteria in the soil. These studies suggest that differences in mineralization are driven by microorganisms. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that interactions between soil microbial community composition and SOC, lead to changes in the dominant species in the microbial community, which in turn affect the turnover of SOC. However, the effects of fertilization treatments on microorganism-mediated alterations in the mineralization process is still unclear. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of microbial regulation of soil carbon pool mineralization is of great significance for the accumulation and sustainable development of farmland soil carbon pool.</p><p>As the only province in China with no plain support, Guizhou Province is dominated by mountains and hills. With an increasing population, nonagricultural land use is increasing and agricultural land is gradually decreasing. Therefore, investigations into fertility conservation and sustainable use of existing cultivated soil are urgently needed. As an important soil resource, paddy soil from yellow earth accounts for 46% of the paddy soil area in Guizhou Province and has a large production function. In addition, yellow paddy soil also has an ecological function of fixing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and mitigating global climate change. Previous studies have focused on the biological activity, physicochemical properties, and carbon and nitrogen balance of yellow paddy soil [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, mineralization as a process of carbon output has not been studied in yellow soil. Furthermore, the impact of chemical fertilizer application on organic carbon mineralization has not been clearly defined, and the contribution of soil microbes to soil carbon pool change under different long-term fertilization conditions are still unclear.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to (1) study the effects of different fertilization measures on soil properties, microbial community abundance, and composition; (2) clarify the effects of different fertilization treatments on soil organic carbon mineralization; and (3) clarify the relative relationship between carbon mineralization parameters, soil properties, and soil microbial communities in paddy soils. We hypothesized that (1) the organic fertilizer treatment will significantly increase organic carbon mineralization and turnover rate compared to chemical fertilizer treatment; and (2) the main dominant species of bacteria will have a lower relative effect on organic carbon mineralization than other species under different long-term fertilization treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study site</title><p>The long-term experimental site was located in Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences (106&#x000b0;39'E, 26&#x000b0;29'N). Seated in the hilly area of central Guizhou, the study site has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average elevation of 1071 m and average annual temperature 15.3 &#x000b0;C. The average annual sunshine duration is about 1354 h and the relative humidity is 75.5%. The annual frost-free period is about 270 days and the annual precipitation is 1100&#x02013;1200 mm. The soil type of the experimental site is yellow paddy soil, and the parent material is Triassic limestone and sand shale weathering material. The soil is sticky, heavy, and has a high silt content. Iron-manganese bound or red-white interbedded layer, which lack organic matter and easily harden, appear in the shallow layer at some places. Due to an insufficient water source, the area is vulnerable to drought disaster. A yearly rice crop was grown in the experimental fields for most of the experimental period, with a period of 5 years (from 2002 to 2006) of corn crop.</p></sec><sec id="sec004" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The long-term location test began in 1995 and the data was collected in 2016. Thus, the study investigates the effects of fertilization treatments over 22 years in a field. The experiment was carried out over a large area with consistently separate treatment groups without any overlap. The plot area of 201 m<sup>2</sup> (35.7 m &#x000d7; 5.6 m) was divided into 4 treatment areas. Four representative fertilization treatments were selected for study on the long-term experimental site: no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), organic fertilizer (M) and constant organic-inorganic fertilizer (MNPK). The chemical fertilizer (NPK) included urea (including N 46%), superphosphate (including 16% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and potassium chloride (including 60% K<sub>2</sub>O). For the NPK group, 2&#x02013;3 days before annual rice transplanting in April, 50% of the urea was applied first followed by superphosphate and potassium chloride, as the base fertilizer. The remaining 30% and 20% of the urea were applied during two topdressing periods, 7&#x02013;10 days after transplanting the rice, and then later in the growing season, respectively. The application amount of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (NPK) was adjusted each year according to the nutrient content of organic fertilizer. The organic fertilizer was cattle manure (including C 413.8 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, N 2.7 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 1.3 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, K<sub>2</sub>O 6.0 g kg<sup>-1</sup>). Annual application of organic fertilizer consisted of 61.1 t ha<sup>-1</sup> for the M treatment. The NPK treatment consisted of N 165 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 82.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and K<sub>2</sub>O 82.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. M fertilizer was applied at one time, 2&#x02013;3 days before rice transplanting, as a base fertilizer. The M treatment did not require topdressing. In the MNPK treatment, the superphosphate and potassium chloride and part of the urea, (50%) were applied as a base fertilizer before the transplanting. The remaining 30% and 20% of the urea were applied during two topdressing periods, 7&#x02013;10 days after transplanting the rice, and then later in the growing season, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Soil sample collection</title><p>Rice was harvested once a year. The rice was transplanted in April each year, and harvested in mid-to-late October; the soil rested for approximately 6 months after harvest, i.e. no crops were planted until the following year. Samples were collected within one week after the rice was harvested in mid-to-late October 2016. At this stage, the surface soil changes from anaerobic to aerobic respiration, and soil moisture is not a dominant factor. Therefore, the correlation between soil organic carbon mineralization and the microbial community was studied in this context to understand soil changes during the fallow period.</p><p>Each of the 4 treatment areas was equally divided into 3 sections (67 m<sup>2</sup>). Samples were collected from 5 evenly spaced spots from each section, and then combined to get a representative sample. Three soil samples were collected from each treatment area. After collection, soil samples were stored in a cooler (for up to 4 hrs) and transported back to the laboratory. After sieving (2-mm) to remove rice root residue and animal residues, the sample was divided into three parts. One part was frozen at -80 &#x000b0;C for high through put sequencing analysis, one part was stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until determination of soil microbial biomass and water content, and the remaining part was air dried naturally to measure soil pH, total nitrogen, and organic carbon.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Soil chemical analysis</title><p>Soil samples were air-dried at room temperature for approximately 15 days. After drying, the samples were sieved (&#x0003c; 2 mm), and then suspended in water at a soil-to-water ratio of 1:5. Suspensions were mixed end-over-end for 1 h at 25 &#x000b0;C, then pH was measured using a pH meter (PHS-3E, INESA, China) [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Thirty grams of soil was adjusted to 60% of field capacity with deionized water and placed in a 50 mL beaker. The 50 mL beaker was placed in the bottom of a 1000 mL culture flask, and pre-cultured for 1 day at 25 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C. A 50 mL absorption cup containing 10 mL of 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> NaOH solution was placed on the bottom of the flask. After sealing the flask, the sample was incubated in a dark incubator at 25 &#x000b1; 1 &#x000b0;C. On the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th, 27th, and 30th day of culture, the lye absorption cup was replaced. Water was added to the soil to constant weight each time the lye absorption cup was changed. After addition of 2 mL of 1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> BaCl<sub>2</sub> solution and 2 drops of phenolphthalein indicator, the samples were titrated to a colorless solution with 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> HCl (calibrated with borax before each titration). The cumulative mineralization amount of organic carbon was calculated based on the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released during the culture period. The Ct value refers to the total amount of soil CO<sub>2</sub> release from the start of the cultivate to a certain point time. For example, the cumulative mineralization amount on the 9th day is equal to the sum of the mineralization amounts of the 3rd day + the 6th day + the 9th day. Soil organic carbon mineralization (CO<sub>2</sub> mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) = C<sub>HCl</sub> &#x000d7; (V<sub>0</sub> &#x02013;V<sub>1</sub>) &#x000d7; 22 / 0.03 at each time point; where C<sub>HCl</sub> is the concentration of hydrochloric acid, mol L<sup>-1</sup>; V<sub>0</sub> is the volume of the blank titration, mL; V<sub>1</sub> is the volume of hydrochloric acid consumed, mL.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>High-throughput sequencing</title><p>Microbial DNA was extracted from 0.5 g of soil samples using the E.Z.N.A. soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

In this study, chemical fertilizer did not significantly affect SOC content. This is consistent with the study by Li et al. in which the effects of chemical and organic fertilizer on soil properties after wheat crops were studied [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Li found no changes in carbon mineralization after chemical fertilization. In contrast, the application of organic fertilizer treatment in this study resulted in significantly increased carbon loss, as previously reported in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Fangueiro showed that addition of livestock slurry to soil resulted in large increases in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, the total amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> released after 30 d of incubation was significantly higher after organic fertilizer treatments (M and MNPK) compared to the chemical treatment. This data supports our hypothesis that organic fertilizer treatment can significantly increase organic carbon mineralization. The differences in organic versus chemical fertilizer effects may be due to inconsistent carbon inputs. Although the input of organic fertilizer directly increases the soil organic carbon content, organic fertilizers promote the growth of plants. The soil of chemical fertilizer application relies solely on the root residues and exudates of the crop to increase carbon input [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the carbon source in the soil treated by organic fertilizer treatment was more abundant, which enhanced the microbial activity and accelerated the carbon pool mineralization process. It is worth noting that in the organic fertilizer treatment, carbon emission, and potential mineralized carbon content of MNPK treatment were higher than the M treatment, but the difference between treatments was not significant. This result highlights the promotion of carbon mineralization by high nitrogen fertilizer (the sum of N fertilizer that is applied in M treatment and NPK treatment) in the MNPK treatment compared to the M treatment, consistent with the study by Henrique et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>No significant difference was detected for the C<sub>0</sub> value estimated by the first-order exponential model when soil was treated with chemical fertilizer (NPK). However, with organic fertilizer treatment (M and MNPK), the C<sub>0</sub> increased significantly. Application of cow manure (M treatment) led to an increase in the mineralization rate constant (k) from 0.032 (CK) to 0.047 and consequently to a decrease in the half-life time (T<sub>1/2</sub>) from 21.7 to 14.8 d (<xref rid="pone.0211163.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The trends were consistent with the investigation by Henrique et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Our results show that long-term fertilization treatments had significant effects on microbial community composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211163.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In particular, NPK treatment had significant effects on the relative abundance of a number of different bacteria phyla. Eo and Park [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggest that an imbalanced N-P-K ratio can drive changes in bacterial communities. Although soil was sampled only once in our study, the results support the conclusions. The long-term fertilization history and basic soil properties affected the microbial community composition. Jangid et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also showed that agricultural management practices, especially fertilizer treatments, over a long time, significantly alter the soil microbial community.</p><p>SOC and SMBN had the greatest impact on community composition, followed by C<sub>t</sub>, TN and SMBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211163.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In our study, the 22 years of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer may have induced different soil carbon nitrogen conversion ratios, resulting in altered microbial community composition. The significant effects of nitrogen content on the microbial community is in agreement with other studies. For example, EO and Park [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that N has significant effects on the bacterial community.</p><p>For soil organic carbon mineralization, the mineralization process is directly governed by the interactions between the amount of microbial biomass, microbial community structure, substrate quality and availability, soil properties, and microclimates [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, the soil samples from all treatments were incubated at the same temperature and humidity, and thus, temperature and humidity had no influence on differences in C mineralization. However, the fertilizer treatments changed soil properties and, thus, may have indirectly changed C mineralization. The influence of microbial communities and soil properties on C mineralization was thus analyzed. The results of this study showed that more than 95% of the community composition in all treatments was similar between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211163.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0211163.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The three dominant bacteria in all treatments were <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Chloroflexi</italic>, and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, These 3 bacterial species were not associated with C mineralization changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211163.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The non-dominant bacteria <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Latescibacteria</italic> were significantly negatively correlated and positively correlated with C mineralization and soil properties, respectively, which was in accordance with our second hypothesis. Therefore, microbial abundance of several non-dominant bacterial species contributed more to the differences in C mineralization than the overall microbial community distribution. These results are in agreement with Kemmitt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], who also indicate that the composition of the soil microbial biomass does not regulate mineralization of native soil organic matter. Thus, soil microbial communities may be functionally redundant with respect to native organic C mineralization.</p><p>One drawback of this study was that we only sampled the soil during one period. Jangid et al. [<xref rid="pone.0211163.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that seasons significantly affected bacterial composition, diversity, and abundance, and total microbial biomass was increased in winter; thus, sampling soil in different seasons may give different results. In this study, samples were collected in late October, after the rice harvest. Rice grows in April and is harvested in mid-to-late October in every year. During the rest of the year (approximately 6 months), the soil is fallow. At this stage, the surface soil changes from anaerobic to aerobic respiration, and soil moisture is not a dominant factor. We studied soil organic carbon mineralization and the microbial community in this context. Thus, our data elucidate changes in the soil only during this fallow period and can be the basis for soil management while the soil is resting. In addition, each of the 4 treatment areas were equally divided into 3 sections (67 m<sup>2</sup>). Samples were collected from 5 evenly spaced spots from each section, and then combined to get a representative sample. Three soil samples were collected from each treatment area. Consequently, there were a total of 60 points at which samples were collected. Thus, we feel that samples were representative of the soil during this fallow period. Despite the drawback of only one sampling period, the conclusions are still supported by the data presented in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Long-term fertilization influenced soil properties, microbial community, and C mineralization, and the differences were most obvious with constant organic-inorganic fertilizer treatment. Constant organic-inorganic fertilizer treatment significantly altered basic soil properties and increased organic C accumulation mineralization, potential mineralized C content, and turnover rate constant. We conclude that the difference in abundance of several bacteria influenced C mineralization, not the composition of soil microbial communities. In addition, SOC and SMBN were the most important contributors to the variance in microbial community composition. The non-dominant bacteria <italic>Gemmatimonadetes</italic> and <italic>Latescibacteria</italic> were significantly negatively correlated and positively correlated with C mineralization, which determined the difference in C mineralization.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that long term fertilization influences the microbial community.

Thus, understanding the response of the microbial community in different soil types is crucial in understanding the impact of long-term fertilization on the ecosystem.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0211163.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Cumulative mineralization of soil organic carbon for 30 days and variance analysis.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0211163.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0211163.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Environmental factors data and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) based Phylum level.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0211163.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank research staffs for their contributions to this work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0211163.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Post</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name>. <article-title>Soil carbon sequestration and land-use change: Processes and potential</article-title>. <source>Global Change Biol</source>. <year>2000</year>; <volume>6</volume>: <fpage>317</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>328</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0211163.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schimel</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Terrestrial ecosystems and the carbon cycle</article-title>. <source>Global Change Biol</source>. <year>1995</year>; <volume>1</volume>: <fpage>77</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>91</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0211163.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>IPCC</collab>. <chapter-title>Climate change, impacts, adaptation and vulnerability</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Parry</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Canziani</surname><given-names>OF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Palutikof</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Van der Linden</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name>, editors. <source>Contribution of working group II to the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Cambridge University Press</publisher-name>; <year>2001</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0211163.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hutchin</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name>. <article-title>Primary production in grasslands and coniferous forests with climate change: An over view</article-title>. <source>Ecol Appl</source>. <year>1991</year>; <volume>1</volume>: <fpage>139</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>156</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.2307/1941807</pub-id>
