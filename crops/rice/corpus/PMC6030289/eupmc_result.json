    "Paddy rice is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, so it is very important to accurately monitor its growth status and photosynthetic efficiency. The nitrogen (N) level is a key factor closely related to crop growth. In this study, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technology combined with multi-variate analysis was applied to investigate the effect of paddy rice variety on N fertilizer level monitoring. Principal components analysis was conducted to extract the variables of the main fluorescence characteristics to identify N levels. Experimental results demonstrated that no nitrogen fertilizer can be completely identified for each paddy rice variety. In addition, other N levels can also be well classified based on the fluorescence characteristics. The relationship between the fluorescence ratio (F735/F685 : F735, and F685 denote the fluorescence intensity at 735 nm, and 685 nm, respectively) and leaf N content of different paddy rice varieties is also discussed. Experimental results revealed that LIF technology is an effective method of monitoring the N fertilizer and leaf biochemical components of paddy rice."
