    "Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae) is an important egg predator of planthoppers which are destructive rice pests. The chemosensory genes in the mirid antennae play important roles in mating and prey-seeking behaviors. To gain a better understanding of the olfaction of C. lividipennis, we sequenced the antennal transcriptomes of the predator to identify the key olfaction genes. We identified 18 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 12 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 1 Niemann-Pick C2 protein (NPC2), 15 odorant receptors (ORs), 6 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 3 gustatory receptors (GRs) and 3 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the relative transcript levels of three ClivORs (ClivOR6, 7 and 14) in the female antennae were 3 to 6 folds higher than that in the male antennae, indicating these genes were more related to oviposition site selection. The relative transcript levels of ClivCSP8 and ClivOR11 were 2.6 and 2.7 times higher in the male antennae than that of the female, respectively, indicating that these genes might be involved in mate searching. Moreover, the responses of dsorco treated predators to volatiles emitted from infested rice were significantly reduced, indicating these volatiles might serve as crucial cues in the host searching of C. lividipennis."
