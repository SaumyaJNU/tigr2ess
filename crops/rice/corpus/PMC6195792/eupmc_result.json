    "As one of the non-selective cation channel gene families, the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) gene family plays a vital role in plant physiological processes that are related to signal pathways, plant development, and environmental stresses. However, genome-wide identification and analysis of the CNGC gene family in maize has not yet been undertaken. In the present study, twelve ZmCNGC genes were identified in the maize genome, which were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They were classified into five major groups: Groups I, II, III, IVa, and IVb. Phylogenetic analysis showed that gramineous plant CNGC genes expanded unequally during evolution. Group IV CNGC genes emerged first, whereas Groups I and II appeared later. Prediction analysis of cis-acting regulatory elements showed that 137 putative cis-elements were related to hormone-response, abiotic stress, and organ development. Furthermore, 120 protein pairs were predicted to interact with the 12 ZmCNGC proteins and other maize proteins. The expression profiles of the ZmCNGC genes were expressed in tissue-specific patterns. These results provide important information that will increase our understanding of the CNGC gene family in maize and other plants."
