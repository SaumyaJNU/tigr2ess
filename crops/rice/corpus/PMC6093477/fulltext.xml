Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a vital role in plant growth, developmental processes, and responses to pathogen infection, but the role of BRs in interactions between plants and insects remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a negative role of BRs in rice defense against brown planthopper (BPH, <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>) and examined its underlying mechanisms. We found that BPH infestation suppressed the BR pathway while successively activating the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. In addition, BR-overproducing mutants and plants treated with 24-epibrassinolide (BL) showed increased susceptibility to BPH, whereas BR-deficient mutants were more resistant than the wild-type. BRs down-regulated the expression of genes related to the SA pathway and reduced SA content while genes related to the JA pathway were up-regulated and JA content increased after BPH infestation. Furthermore, BR-mediated suppression of the SA pathway was impaired both in JA-deficient and JA-insensitive mutants. Our results demonstrate that BRs promote the susceptibility of rice plants to BPH by modulating the SA and JA pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Brassinosteroids (BRs)</kwd><kwd>jasmonic acid (JA)</kwd><kwd><italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (BPH)</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (rice)</kwd><kwd>salicylic acid (SA)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Research Program</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0100600</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">NSFC</named-content></funding-source><award-id>31522039</award-id><award-id>31471470</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China</named-content></funding-source><award-id>BK20150026</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Transformation Program</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2014ZX08001-001</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</named-content></funding-source><award-id>KJYQ201602</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is one of the most important staple foods, feeding over half of the world population. Insect pests are a major threat to rice production. The brown planthopper (BPH; Homoptera: Delphacidae) is a typical phloem-sucking herbivore and is one of the most serious and destructive insect pests in rice-growing areas (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Normile, 2008</xref>). As well as causing direct damage, it also indirectly affects plants by transmitting viruses, including the rice ragged stunt virus and the grassy stunt virus (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The most economical and efficient strategy to control BPH is host resistance (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Jena <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Although at least eight BPH-resistance genes have been cloned, knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms of plant&#x02013;BPH interactions is still limited (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Tamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that interactions between plants and phloem-sucking herbivores share similar mechanisms to plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions. For example, the BPH resistance locus <italic>Bph3</italic> in rice is a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane-localized lectin receptor kinases (<italic>LecRK</italic>s) that are considered to be potential cell-surface receptors that prime pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Bph9</italic>, <italic>Bph14</italic>, <italic>Bph18</italic>, and <italic>Bph26</italic> as well as the aphid-resistance gene <italic>Mi1.2</italic> have been categorized as genes that produce the coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat motif proteins (CC-NB-LRR) that are known to mediate resistance through direct or indirect recognition of pathogen effectors in rice (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Rossi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Tamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a small-molecule plant hormone that plays a vital role in plant innate immunity against pathogens, and several studies have shown that it is involved in resistance to phloem-feeding insects. For example, aphid infestation can induce SA accumulation and increase the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), a key enzyme in SA biosynthesis in wheat and barley (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Mohase and van der Westhuizen, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chaman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The SA pathway has been reported as participating in <italic>Bph9</italic>-, <italic>Bph14</italic>-, and <italic>Bph29</italic>-mediated BPH resistance in rice, with the SA content accumulating after BPH infestation (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). These findings indicate that SA plays an important role in plant defense response to sap-sucking herbivores.</p><p>Jasmonic acid (JA) is synthesized from linolenic acid through the action of several enzymes in plant chloroplast membranes, and current evidence indicates that it induces resistance against necrotrophic pathogens and chewing herbivores (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wasternack and Hause, 2013</xref>). Antagonistic interactions between SA and JA are well documented (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Aljbory and Chen, 2018</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated SA-mediated suppression of JA through the action of the <italic>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</italic> (<italic>NPR1</italic>), <italic>MYB44</italic>, and <italic>WRKY70</italic> genes in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Spoel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Shim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Other studies have shown that JA can inhibit SA through the <italic>JAZ</italic> and <italic>MYC2</italic> genes in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Both the SA and JA pathways in rice have been shown to be induced by BPH feeding (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). However, SA content and BPH resistance were significantly increased when expression of <italic>13-lipoxygenase</italic>, <italic>OsHI-LOX</italic>, a JA biosynthesis-related gene was silenced (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Hence, the relationship between SA and JA in the immunity response to BPH seems ambiguous, or paradoxical in at least some instances, and needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and development (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Tong and Chu, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Feng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Many studies have shown that BRs function as negative regulators of innate immunity in plants (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Belkhadir <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nahar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Interactions between BRs and SA have been reported in the disease-resistance response in rice (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and it has been found that the susceptibility mediated by BRs is also suppressed by the JA pathway (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nahar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In contrast to the relative wealth of understanding of the functions of BRs in the interactions of plants and pathogens, little information is available about the role of BRs in defense against herbivores, especially with regard to phloem-sucking herbivores in monocots.</p><p>To better understand the mechanisms of rice&#x02013;BPH interactions, we investigated the effects of BPH infestation on the BR pathway. We found that it was significantly inhibited by infestation and that two BR-overproducing mutants showed higher susceptibility to BPH than the wild-type. In contrast, BR-deficient plants displayed increased resistance. Further investigation showed that the role of BRs in promoting BPH susceptibility might be mediated by suppressing SA-mediated defense. In addition, BR-mediated suppression of SA depended on the JA pathway. Based on our results, we propose that BRs mediate susceptibility to BPH in rice by modulating the SA and JA pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The rice lines (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) used in this work included <italic>m107</italic>, <italic>slg-D</italic>, <italic>NahG</italic>, <italic>lhdd10</italic>, <italic>coi1-18</italic>, <italic>og1</italic>, and Zhonghua 11. <italic>m107</italic> and <italic>NahG</italic> were kindly provided by Professor Chencai Chu (Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing) (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Tong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

Likewise, silencing of <italic>BAK1</italic> and <italic>BRI1</italic> results in decreased JA-Ile levels in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The antagonistic crosstalk between the SA and JA pathways has been reported to modulate the defense response in rice (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Yuan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">De Vleesschauwer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Exogenous application of JA can dramatically decrease the SA content in rice, which suggests that JA can suppress the SA pathway (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Tamaoki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Our results showed that BR treatment increased the JA concentration while decreasing the SA content, and the suppressive effect of BRs on the SA pathway was eliminated in JA-deficient and JA-insensitive mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), indicating that BR-dependent induction of JA might contribute to the suppression of SA mediated by BRs. In comparison with the alleviation of BR-mediated suppression of SA in <italic>og-1</italic>, we found that the SA pathway was actually induced in the <italic>coi1-18</italic> mutant after BL treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). A possible reason could be that, except for the canonical JA pathway, there may exist an <italic>OsCOI1</italic>-dependent and biosynthesis-independent pathway of suppression of SA mediated by BRs; this hypothesis needs to be further tested. Although the antagonism between SA and JA has been well described in plant biotic stress responses (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Thaler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), here we have determined for the first time that the BR-mediated suppression of the SA pathway can occur through the JA pathway.</p><p>Growth&#x02013;defense trade-offs are thought to occur in plants as a result of resource restrictions, and hormone crosstalk has emerged as a major factor in the regulation of such trade-offs (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Huot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). BRs are crucial regulators of plant growth and in our study the BR pathway was clearly inhibited by BPH feeding whereas the defense-related SA and JA pathways were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that the rice host plants might activate a defense response to BPH infestation at the expense of reduced growth. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of a previous study that auxin-, gibberellin-, and BR-related genes were down-regulated while the SA and JA pathways were activated in response to BPH infestation (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<italic>a</italic></xref>). Although the SA and JA pathways were induced upon BPH infestation, we also found that the inductions of the two hormones were not simultaneous. The transcript levels of genes related to the SA pathway were moderately up-regulated at 6 h, their expression peaked at about 12 h, and this was followed by a decrease at 24 h, whereas genes related to the JA pathway were most significantly induced at about 24 h after BPH infestation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Similar transcript patterns of the SA and JA pathways in response to BPH infestation have also been described in previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that BRs positively regulated the JA pathway while negatively regulating the SA pathway, which resulted in increased susceptibility of rice plants to BPH. As a defense mechanism against BPH attack, the BR pathway was inhibited whilst the SA pathway was induced, which was followed by activation of the BPH resistance response. Although the underlying mechanisms of the molecular modulation of the interactions between these hormones needs to be further studied, our findings advance our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the resistance of plants to insect pests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s19"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1.
