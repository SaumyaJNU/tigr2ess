ANTs were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Animals were randomly given varying doses of ANT-rich extract treatment (500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg) in the absence or presence of 5-FU-induced mucositis. Buccal mucosae were photographed and scored for macroscopic analysis and incisional biopsies of cheek pouches were collected for microscopic examination of oral mucositis. 5-FU caused marked hemorrhage, extensive ulcerations and abscesses compared to non-treated animals with slight erythema. Histologically, a loss of collagen bundles and inflammatory cell infiltrates was observed. After 29 days of ANT treatment, lesions resolved, and abundant collagen fibers were evident in the lamina propria. Buccal mucosa of 5-FU-injected rats showed increased Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) p50 and p65 in oral keratinocytes.

Introduction</title><p>Oral mucositis is a significant complication of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, occurring in 80&#x02013;100% of patients undergoing &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; regimens and 40% of patients receiving standard dose chemotherapy [<xref rid="B1-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Initially, oral mucositis manifests as erythematous lesions 4&#x02013;5 days following chemotherapy, progresses to erosive and ulcerative lesions within 7&#x02013;10 days and persists for 2&#x02013;4 weeks [<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lesions associated with mucositis result in severe pain, difficulty in speech and swallowing, and a decreased quality of life for the patient. Furthermore, it predisposes the patient to a higher risk of local and systemic infection and interferes with the ability to deliver the intended dose of cancer therapy, thereby posing a threat to patient life, as well as causing an increased length of hospital stay for the patient [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a common chemotherapeutic agent which is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 5-FU is an antimetabolite drug that acts as a phase-specific anti-pyrimidine by inhibiting DNA synthesis via inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate synthase [<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additional molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of 5-FU have been reported, such as via the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase pathway activation [<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 5-FU was also found to inhibit cancer cell migration by upregulating Sestrin-2 [<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy with 5-FU causes toxicity to the entire gastrointestinal tract. These cytotoxic effects are particularly evident in the oral and the oropharyngeal mucosa due to its rapid rate of epithelial cell turnover. Oral mucositis is not only a consequence of direct injury to the oral basal cells, but is also caused by a series of complex biological events based on five overlapping biological phases: initiation, message generation, signal amplification, ulceration, and healing [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mechanism of 5-FU-induced oral mucositis has been well identified. Likewise, the activation and translocation of transcription factor, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), from the cytosol to the nucleus is one of the key elements in the initiation of 5-FU-induced mucositis that leads to the upregulation of genes and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 [<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 [<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) [<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The consumption of anthocyanins (ANTs) has a wide range of health-promoting properties [<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ANTs are members of the flavonoid group of phytochemicals that have been shown to have antioxidative properties and potential in therapeutic immunomodulation, leading to anti-cancer [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In vitro, ANTs from black soybean seed coats prevent excessive inflammation by blocking the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 into the nucleus in human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In an in vivo rat model of acute lung inflammation, ANT from blackberries was shown to reduce inflammatory parameters in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, human models have revealed that ANT could suppress NF-&#x003ba;B activation in monocytes and reduce the plasma concentration of pro-inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, Tao, et al. reported that the administration of ANT from red cabbage (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L. var. <italic>capitata</italic> L.) could prevent irinotecan-induced intestinal mucositis [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Black rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) has been widely cultivated and consumed in Southeast Asian countries for a long time. ANT in black rice was able to restore liver enzyme activity in rats with liver damage through its antioxidant properties [<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, ANTs were also shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="B22-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Despite these findings, there have been no investigations into the effects of black rice-derived ANT in oral mucositis.</p><p>Although a variety of new approaches to oral mucositis have been employed, an efficacious intervention for prophylaxis or management of oral mucositis has not yet been identified. Based on our ANT study, and the critical role of NF-&#x003ba;B activation in the initiation of oral mucositis, the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of ANT-rich extract found in <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. on oral wound healing, using an experimental rat model of 5-FU-induced mucositis, as well as attempting to elucidate possible transcription factor mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-19-02981"><title>2.

Identification of Anthocyanins (ANT) in Oryza sativa L.</title><p>The ANT composition of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. was determined by HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) HPLC-ESI-MS. The ANT were purified using a Hypersil Gold C18 column and the resulting chromatogram at 530 nm is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). A chromatogram within the retention time of 30&#x02013;30.5 min indicated the presence of Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G); in addition, a chromatogram within the retention time of 36.5&#x02013;37.2 min, was identified as Pelargonidin-3-glucoside (P3G). Fragmentation patterns in the mass spectra of C3G and P3G in the ANT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f001">Figure 1</xref>B.

In the group which underwent 5-FU injection, the general condition of the animals, as reflected in their weight loss, became poor; however, the groups under pretreatment with ANT-rich extract were less morbid. During the experimental period, no mortality was seen in the rats that had received ANT-rich extract. Rats in group A and E showed no general health problems.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-19-02981"><title>2.3.

Severe clinical manifestations of oral mucositis patterns such as erythema, extensive ulcerations, and abscesses were shown in groups B, C and D which were subjected to 5-FU injection. On day 29, rats in group B showed a macroscopic pattern of accentuated erythema, extensive ulcers, and abscesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Interestingly, rats in group C showed generalized erythema without abscesses and hemorrhage. Animals receiving ANT-rich extract intake for 1000 mg/kg (group D) showed lesion healing without erythema. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D show the box plot of the macroscopic scores of the mucositis lesion on days 17 and 29, respectively. On day 17, the macroscopic scores of the lesion in group B were predominately grade 2 and 3 (2.83 &#x000b1; 0.27), and the values were higher when compared to group C (2.05 &#x000b1; 0.1) and group D (2.0 &#x000b1; 0.9). In addition, the administration of deionized water (DI) (group A) or ANT-rich extract alone (group E) revealed a significantly lowered macroscopic score (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) compared to group B. On day 29, a significant decrease of macroscopic score (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) was found in group D (0.27 &#x000b1; 0.4) but not group C (1.05 &#x000b1; 0.9) compared to group B (2.28 &#x000b1; 0.4). Furthermore, no mucositis lesions were observed at the left buccal mucosa of all rats throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). The macroscopic scores on days 17 and 29 were measured by three examiners. The Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient (r) was used to show the correlation between the examiners (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02981">Figure S1</xref>). According to the macroscopic results obtained, we concluded that pretreatment with ANT-rich extract 1000 mg/kg in 5-FU rats for 29 days exhibited a significant recovery of wound healing compared to rats receiving 5-FU alone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-19-02981"><title>2.4. Effect of ANT-Pretreatment on Histopathological Aspects of 5-FU-Induced Oral Mucositis</title><p>Collagen is the primary component of the extracellular matrix in connective tissue [<xref rid="B23-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Closely comparable histopathological results of oral mucositis lesions were obtained compared with the macroscopic findings. At day 29, Mallory&#x02019;s azan-stained buccal mucosae in 5-FU-injected rats without ANT-rich extract pretreatment (group B) showed a severe loss of collagen bundles in the connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). For the ANT-rich extract pretreatment group (groups C and D), well-organized, parallel, densely packed and thick bundles of collagen fibers were demonstrated in the lesion, whereas collagen fibers were prominently mature in the oral mucosae of non-5-FU control rats (group E). In addition, a corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained wound section is shown for granulation tissue and inflammatory cells in the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Examination of the non-5-FU-injected group without oral mucositis (groups A and E) revealed normal rat buccal mucosae with normal epithelium and connective tissue without inflammatory infiltration. Rats in group B showed granulation tissue with an abundant accumulation of mononuclear cells around the blood vessels, the presence of hemorrhagic areas, and active inflammation, but inflammation was attenuated in the ANT-rich extract-pretreatment group. Oral mucositis lesions with healing in group C revealed vascular ingurgitation, areas of re-epithelialization, inflammatory cell infiltration with neutrophil prevalence, and the absence of hemorrhagic areas, edema, ulceration or abscesses. These results were more pronounced in group D with no discrete erythema, no hemorrhagic areas or abscess, comparable to the histopathologic examination in group E. The amount of collagen was quantified in respective tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). The average collagen level in group B was significantly lower than that in the non-5-FU control (group A) (37.8 &#x000b1; 5.4 and 52.8 &#x000b1; 4.9; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

The oral epithelium thickness was also compared among the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f004">Figure 4</xref>D).

ANT Protect 5-FU-induced Oral Keratinocyte Cell Growth Suppression</title><p>Based on the results above, we sought to examine the effect of ANT-rich extract on 5-FU in oral keratinocytes in vitro. At first, cell proliferation was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The dose of ANT-rich extract up to 2 mg/mL did not affect the survival or growth rate of the cells (data not shown). The growth inhibitory response of oral keratinocytes to 5-FU was investigated for 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). 5-FU at the concentrations of 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g/mL induced an apparent statistically significant cell growth inhibition (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) but did not exert a cytotoxic effect. Based on this finding, we chose a 5-FU concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/mL for use in further studies regarding whether or not ANT-rich extract can restore the suppressive effect of 5-FU on cell growth. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, ANT-rich extract alone did not affect cell growth when compared to the growth of the control cells. In addition, the dose of ANT-rich extract (1 mg/mL), which did not affect cell growth when used alone, resulted in an enhanced recovery of cell growth when used in combination with 5-FU. Our findings suggested a protective effect of ANT-rich extract on the amelioration of 5-FU-induced growth suppression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot8-ijms-19-02981"><title>2.8. ANT Suppresses NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 Levels in Nuclear Fraction of Oral Keratinocytes</title><p>Our study demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B activation was found in the biopsy of rat oral mucosae treated with 5-FU; we therefore evaluated whether ANT-rich extract inhibited 5-FU-induced NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 activation. Oral keratinocytes were treated with 0.5 and 1 mg/mL ANT-rich extract and/or 10 g/mL 5-FU for 1 h, and isolated nuclei were analyzed for the kinetics of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (nuclear translocation), assessed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). 5-FU significantly increased the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and NF-&#x003ba;B p65 as compared to the control (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Following 0.5 mg/mL of ANT-rich extract treatment, we observed 44.2% and 41.4% inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 phosphorylation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f008">Figure 8</xref>B).

There was no statistically significant difference in NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 levels between untreated cells and ANT-rich extract alone-treated cells (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The expected decrease in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was also evident across the ANT-rich extract dose range, while ANT-rich extract abundantly abrogated NF-&#x003ba;B p50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f008">Figure 8</xref>C) and NF-&#x003ba;B p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f008">Figure 8</xref>D) nuclear translocation in response to 5-FU.There was a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) present between 0.5 and 1 mg/mL of ANT-rich extract treatment regarding the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 levels, whereas treatment of cells with 0.5 mg/mL ANT-rich extract did not affect the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of NF-&#x003ba;B p65. These data are in agreement with our results in the animal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02981-f005">Figure 5</xref>) indicated that 5-FU increased the phosphorylation of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 and is thereby suppressed by ANT-rich extract treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-19-02981"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Studies on mucositis using animal models focus on continuing the search for new therapies for oral mucositis. The results from this study suggest that ANT-rich extract demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory properties and oral mucosa wound healing through the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 signaling in 5-FU induced oral mucositis rat model and in the oral keratinocyte culture. To the best of our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time that ANT-rich extract from black rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is able to protect rats from post-chemotherapy oral mucositis and suppress the cell growth inhibitory effect of 5-FU. The results demonstrate a protective effect of ANT-rich extract on 5-FU induced oral mucositis, which was consistent with previous studies stating that ANT significantly lowered chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis [<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that ANT-rich extract from bilberry exhibited a protective effect against the myelotoxicity caused by 5-FU [<xref rid="B27-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Microorganisms inhabiting the oral cavity can enter the system through the ulcerative lesions seen in oral mucositis, consequently causing systemic infection in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy [<xref rid="B28-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Additionally, our findings revealed a significant loss of body weight in rats treated with 5-FU as early as day 14, suggesting a systemic repercussion of experimental oral mucositis, consistent with previous studies in a hamster model [<xref rid="B29-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, gavage feeding with ANT did not cause any alterations in the average body weights of rats. In the present study, the chromatogram of purified products following ANT detection showed that C3G was the predominant ANT present in Thai <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. The minor ANT detection was P3G. The ANT composition identified in our black rice extract was consistent with previous reporting [<xref rid="B30-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, ANT was extracted in ethanol and contained C3G &#x02248; 0.85 mg/g and P3G &#x02248; 0.076 mg/g of the dry extract. The FRAP value and total phenolic content of the ANT-rich extract is 27.23 mM Fe (II) equivalents/gFW and 181.73 mM GAE/gFW, respectively. However, Sompong, et al. demonstrated tthe C3G (5.69 mg/g) and peonidin3-glucoside (11.46 mg/g) contents in black rice using HCl solvent in methanol (85:15, (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) [<xref rid="B31-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Their total phenolic contents values (300&#x02013;600 mM GAE/gFW) were also higher than those of our extracts. The previous study on the ANT content of different rice varieties demonstrated that Thai red rice, Niaw Dam Pleuak Khao and Niaw Dam Pleuak Dam, followed by China black rice, has a superior quality with respect to its ANT compositions [<xref rid="B31-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The higher amount of ANT content and antioxidant capacities from the previous study compared to our findings are probably due to differences in rice cultivars, as well as varying methods of extraction, separation, purification, and analysis between the studies.</p><p>Previous study showed that rats receiving ANT-rich extract from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. Japonica at 500 mg/kg had an effect against liver damage by alcohol [<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Before beginning the current experiments, different concentrations (250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg/kg) of the same ANT extracts were tested. C3G is considered as a powerful antioxidant with pharmacological benefits including antioxidant properties [<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We report for the first time that the highest ANT dose (1000 mg/kg body weight) from Thai black rice, which was gavage-fed once daily, contains approximately 0.85 mg/kg; C3G shows maximum protective and healing effects on oral mucositis induced by 5-FU. Apart from total phenolic and anthocyanin content, black rice contains high levels of flavonoids; more phytochemical analysis and the pharmaceutical activity of this plant should be further investigated.</p><p>5-FU is a common chemotherapeutic drug that causes oral mucositis [<xref rid="B4-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 5-FU injected rats have been demonstrated to be at a high risk of oral mucositis [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recent studies have pinpointed NF-&#x003ba;B as having a key role in the pathogenesis of mucositis [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, we detected an abundance of activated NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 in nuclear-stained oral keratinocytes obtained from rats injected with 5-FU. The exact mechanism(s) by which 5-FU causes oral mucositis are still unknown; however, 5-FU has been reported as an inducer of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the abundant amount of activated NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 seen in oral keratinocytes and inflammatory cells in the granulation tissues of rats treated with 5-FU alone suggests the importance of NF-&#x003ba;B in the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced oral mucositis. In agreement with our investigation, previous studies have shown strong associations between NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated biological manipulation of the oral mucosa and mucositis progression [<xref rid="B35-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In the present investigation, we demonstrated that ANT-rich extract significantly reduced the lesions induced by 5-FU in the oral mucosa. The data provided in this study strongly suggest that ANT-rich extract given prior to chemotherapy favorably affects the severity and duration of ulcerative mucositis induced by 5-FU. The macroscopic and microscopic effects were associated with reduced inflammatory infiltration and epithelialization. Accordingly, these histopathologic findings were presented in a previous study [<xref rid="B27-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although there were variations in the parameters used for biochemical analysis, plant species, and ANT content in the study mentioned. The results herein further verify the anti-inflammatory role of ANT on NF-&#x003ba;B and HMGB1 expression following 5-FU-treatment by immunohistochemical analysis and ELISA. Thus, the protective role of ANT found in the present study may be explained by its capacity to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p65 activation, thereby inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines that mediate 5-FU-induced oral mucositis. These findings are consistent with previous observations in animal and clinical studies, where ANT demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by the inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B transactivation [<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and decreased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators in human subjects [<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The primary damage of oral mucositis response describes an activation of transcription factors such as NF-&#x003ba;B leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6, which cause damage to both epithelium and connective tissue [<xref rid="B2-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the ANT-rich extract partially protects against 5-FU-induced cellular stasis in oral keratinocytes, and restores oral mucosal surfaces in vivo via immunological modulatory effects. Future studies should assess the predictive potential of ANT in determining associated cytokine production in vitro using peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p><p>In the present study, erythema, hyperemia, hemorrhagic areas, and extensive ulcer and abscesses appeared in the cheek pouches of rats which were subjected to 5-FU injection by day 14, and their degree was maximal by day 17. Wound healing involves complex cellular and molecular interactions. There are five phases involved in the pathogenesis of mucositis, including initiation, primary damage and message generation, signal amplification, ulceration, and healing phase [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following the initiation of the healing cascade by direct injury to DNA, a series of transcription factors were prompted to respond to the primary damage, which triggered a consequence of cytokine release. In the final stage of the healing process, collagen deposition and remodeling occurs. Our findings demonstrated a slight decrease in the macroscopic scores of mucositis in rats which were treated with ANT-rich extract (groups C and D) compared to group B on day 17 of the experiment. However, a significant decrease in these scores (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) was observed on day 29 in rats which were treated with ANT-rich extract for 1000 mg/kg (group D) compared to group B. In addition, ANT-rich extract treatments attenuated NF-&#x003ba;B activation, suppressed the elevation of HMGB1 expression, and induced collagen formation. Thus, from our findings, ANT-rich extract treatments may not result in direct repair during the initiation stage of the wound healing but promote a permeability of collagen to the lesion, epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and repair the destructive mucosa during the late stage. Nevertheless, specific growth factors such as nerve growth factor [<xref rid="B36-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or drugs such as corticosteroids [<xref rid="B37-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which take part in the effective wound healing in the oral cavity should be employed to compare the efficacy with ANT-rich extract.</p><p>The present study is, as far as we know, the first investigation into the protective effects of ANT in 5-FU&#x02013;induced oral mucositis and its involvement in protecting oral keratinocytes from the growth inhibitory effect of 5-FU. Mucositis can affect the entire mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, with oral and oropharyngeal mucosae being common sites of disease occurrence [<xref rid="B38-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our findings in vitro are consistent with animal studies demonstrating that the nuclear portions of NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and NF-&#x003ba;B p65 were activated by 5-FU, then suppressed following ANT-rich extract administration. However, the molecular mechanisms in other cells involved in oral mucositis such as oral fibroblasts should be further investigated [<xref rid="B39-ijms-19-02981" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. With these outcomes, further clinical studies on the anticancer activities of black rice extract should be performed.</p><p>In conclusion, our results highly suggest that ANT found in Thai <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. extracts possess anti-inflammatory and protective effects against experimental models of mucositis induced by 5-FU. We speculate that these anti-inflammatory effects are related to NF-&#x003ba;B suppression. The possibility of using this extract in the treatment of human oral mucositis merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-19-02981"><title>4.

To prevent nonspecific binding, the membrane was blocked with a solution containing 5% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) nonfat dry milk with 1% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at RT. Anti-NF-&#x003ba;B p50 or p65 Ab was incubated for 1 h at RT. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse monoclonal IgG (MP Biomedicals Inc., Solon, OH, USA). Labeled bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare Bio-Science, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and exposed to high-performance chemiluminescence film (GE Healthcare).
