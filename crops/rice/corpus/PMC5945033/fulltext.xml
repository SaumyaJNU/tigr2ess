Unmanned aerial systems have a high potential of being utilized to improve this detection process since they can reduce the time needed for scouting for the disease at a field scale, and are affordable and user-friendly in operation. In this study, a commercialized quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with digital and multispectral cameras, was used to capture imagery data of research plots with 67 rice cultivars and elite lines. Collected imagery data were then processed and analyzed to characterize the development of ShB and quantify different levels of the disease in the field. Through color features extraction and color space transformation of images, it was found that the color transformation could qualitatively detect the infected areas of ShB in the field plots. However, it was less effective to detect different levels of the disease. Five vegetation indices were then calculated from the multispectral images, and ground truths of disease severity and GreenSeeker measured NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were collected. The results of relationship analyses indicate that there was a strong correlation between ground-measured NDVIs and image-extracted NDVIs with the <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> of 0.907 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0854, and a good correlation between image-extracted NDVIs and disease severity with the <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> of 0.627 and the RMSE of 0.0852. Use of image-based NDVIs extracted from multispectral images could quantify different levels of ShB in the field plots with an accuracy of 63%. These results demonstrate that a customer-grade UAV integrated with digital and multispectral cameras can be an effective tool to detect the ShB disease at a field scale.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Development Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>1604A0702016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41771463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Dongyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41771463, 41771469), and the Science and Technology Development Program of Anhui Province (1604A0702016).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world, providing a major source of nourishment for over half the world population. Rice diseases, especially sheath blight (ShB) caused by <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> AG1-1A, are among the most important factors limiting rice production worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The ShB disease usually develops in the later tillering or early internode elongation stage of rice. Infected tissue looks brown to yellow or even bleached in color. Symptoms of the disease first appear on the lower sheaths of plants and then develop onto upper sheaths and leaves. ShB spreads from plant to plant through the growth of the fungus and usually forms in a circular pattern in the field [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under favorable conditions, this disease spreads quickly to top plant parts, causing lodgings of the plants. The disease occurs every year, causing significant losses in grain yield and quality in the US and other rice-producing counties of the world [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ShB has become the second most economically-important disease in rice in the world [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Cultivar resistance can be the most effective, economic means for management of rice ShB and other crop diseases. Plant phenotyping plays a critical role in breeding programs for the development of cultivars of rice and other field crops with improved disease resistance. Plant phenotyping also has been widely used in crop breeding programs to assess plant traits such as plant growth, development, abiotic stress tolerance, architecture, physiology, ecology, and yield [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, optical sensor technologies have been developed and used to assist plant phenotyping and disease detection and diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Digital (red, green, and blue)-, multispectral-, hyperspectral-, flrorescence imaging- and thermal infrared-based sensors have been utilized to characterize plant disease symptoms, detect different diseases, and even quantify severity of several diseases in the laboratory and field [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies have been conducted on wheat, barley and vegetables including tomatoes and cucumbers [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, no significant advances in high-throughput phenotyping have been made on rice. This is probably due to the flooding conditions under which rice plants grow, limiting the ability to use this remote sensing technology.</p><p>Unmanned Aerial Systems, one of new remote sensing platforms, has played an important role in application in precision agriculture. This technology has the advantages of high-spatial resolution, high efficiency, low costs, and flexibility in use [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Use of the technology can facilitate the quick and accurate detection of plant diseases at a field scale and thus improve disease management efficacy through on-time applications and/or site-specific applications of fungicides.</p><p>In this study, a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with digital (Red, Green, and Blue bands) or multispectral (Near-infrared, Red edge, Red, Green to Blue bands) camera, was utilized to capture high-spatial resolution imagery data of different ShB-resistant rice cultivars and lines in research plots to characterize and detect the ShB disease in rice at a field scale. The objectives of this work were to: 1) quantify the changes in color, texture and structure associated with the symptoms of ShB at the level of canopy by high-resolution digital and multispectral images, 2) determine the correlations between color features or vegetation indices and ShB severity, and 3) evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of vegetation indices-based detection of ShB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Experimental site</title><p>A field trial was conducted at Texas A&#x00026;M AgriLife Research Center (30&#x000b0;03'53.4"N, 94&#x000b0;17'38.7"W), Beaumont, Texas, USA. Sixty-seven rice cultivars and elite lines with different levels of resistance to ShB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187470.t001">Table 1</xref>) were selected to characterize and detect their differences in the development of the disease in research plots. Rice was drill seeded in 67 plots consisting of seven 2.4-m rows, spaced 18 cm between rows on May 8, 2015. Each plot was divided into two equal-length sections. One end section of the plot was inoculated with the ShB pathogen by manually broadcasting 100 ml of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solani</italic> inoculum on July 10; the other end section was left with no pathogen inoculation, serving as the disease-free control. Our previous observations showed that the ShB pathogen has very limited ability to spread from one section to another [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This experiment was specifically designed to allow for observing and comparing the development of the disease at different growth stages of rice. Fertility, irrigation, and weed and insect pest control followed local recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On August 23 and 30, the severity of ShB was rated on a scale of 0 to 9 where 0 represents no symptoms and 9 represents most severe in symptoms and damage (leaves dead or plants collapsed). The resistance of selected cultivars to ShB was indicated as very susceptible (VS), susceptible (S), and moderately susceptible (MS) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187470.t001">Table 1</xref>). Both disease assessment dates corresponded approximately 3 and 2 weeks from maturity of most of the rice cultivars and elite lines evaluated in this study.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0187470.t001"

The denser and more vigorous the plant, the greater the difference is observed between the reflected light signals. When taking the ground NDVI readings in this study, the GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor was held 100 cm above the canopy of rice plants, with an ovalfield of view covering the area of 42 cm<sup>2</sup>.

In this study, high-resolution RGB and multispectral imagery data were acquired and analyzed with the aim of qualitatively and quantitatively detecting the rice ShB in research plots. The results demonstrate that color features extracted from RGB and multispectral images could partially distinguish the canopy changes caused by the disease. However, it does not provide sufficient information to differentiate different levels of ShB because of less spectral wavelength and broad bands associated with the RGB camera used in this study. This limits the potential application of UAV equipped with RGB camera to the detection of the disease at a commercial scale and to the screening of ShB-resistant cultivars and elite lines in research plots for the rice breeding program.</p><p>On the contrary, NDVI, one of five kinds of VIs calculated from multispectral imagery data in this study, had a strong relationship with ShB severity.

These results indicate that it is insufficient to utilize NDVIs to quantify ShB severity at an earlier stage of disease development. This is in agreement with the results obtained from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. More works is needed to improve the differentiation accuracy of rice ShB at early growth stages. Using hyperspectral sensor might be a way to characterize subtle details of crop diseases. Yang demonstrated that VIs calculated from nano-level hyperspectral bands can assess the severity of bacterial leaf blight in rice precisely [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mahlein pointed out that hyperspectral camera and VIs derived from sensitive bands have data benefits to diagnose plant diseases and phenotypes [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our previous research also confirmed that hyperspectral sensor with broad wavelengths and narrow bands can capture subtle changes in the symptoms of ShB in rice at an earlier stage of disease development [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, additional investigations are needed to explore the potential use of narrow-bands multispectral and hyperspectral sensors to effectively detect ShB at early stages of development.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Influence of sampling area selection on the detection of ShB</title><p>Selection of sampling areas in the field can affect the accuracy of detecting ShB severity due to the nature of cluster distribution of the disease in infected fields [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this study, three methods of selecting a sample area, circular sampling, rectangle sampling, and manual selection by a plant pathologist, were evaluated to determine their efficacy of detecting ShB severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187470.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These three sampling methods were all acceptable in efficacy with no significant differences in R<sup>2</sup> and RMSE. The R<sup>2</sup> and RMSE values for the correlation between image-extracted NDVIs and ShB severity are, respectively, 0.627 and 0.0852 for the circular area sampling method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187470.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), 0.598 and 0.0825 for the rectangle area sampling method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187470.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and 0.635 and 0.0854 for the selection of sampling area by an investigator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187470.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The reason for the method of selecting sample area by an investigator having a highest value of R<sup>2</sup> is because such manual selection can effectively target diseased areas for disease assessment. The R<sup>2</sup> value is relatively greater for the circular area sampling method than for the rectangle area sampling method. This is due to fact that the circular area sampling method could cover more percentage of diseased areas in the field plots than the later one. The rice ShB tends to spread more likely in circular pattern than in rectangle pattern from a point focus of inoculation in the field [<xref rid="pone.0187470.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This resulted in a decreased error in disease detection made by the circular area sampling method. Therefore, selecting an optimal sampling method based on the spread pattern of a disease is also a factor to improve disease detection efficacy when using image-based UAV platforms.</p><fig id="pone.0187470.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187470.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Three sampling methods.</title><p>They were assigned as rectangle area sampling (black rectangle), circular area sampling (red circle), and manual sampling by a plant pathologist (yellow dashed lines).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0187470.g005"/></fig><fig id="pone.0187470.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0187470.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><p><bold>Correlations between image-based NDVIs and ShB severity using circular sampling (A) and rectangle sampling (B) methods on Aug 30<sup>th</sup></bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0187470.g006"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Influence of flying altitude on the detection of ShB</title><p>Flying altitude can be an important factor affecting the ability of UAVs to detect the details of ShB development and plant canopy in the field.

Collected imagery data were then processed and analyzed to characterize the development of ShB and quantify different levels of the disease in the field. Ground truth data of ShB severity and NDVIs were also measured for comparisons. Hue value of color features obtained from RGB images can clearly differentiate the infected areas from the healthy, uninfected areas in field plots on August 30<sup>th</sup>. NDVIs calculated from the multispectral images could quantify different levels of the disease in the plots with an accuracy of 63%. Image-based NDVI values were strongly correlated with ground-NDVI values with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.91. There was a good relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64) between ground-NDVI values and disease severity. These results demonstrate for the first time that image-based NDVI is an effective means to detect ShB and quantify the severity of the disease at a field scale.</p><p>Combined use of an UAV with high-spatial resolution camera is an innovation that has the high potential for quick and accurate detection of ShB, one of the most important diseases in rice in the world. This technology can aid in the scouting and monitoring process of this disease and reduce the costs in time and effort associated with this process. This UAV system in the current form can also assist crop breeders in breeding for rice cultivars with resistance to ShB. In addition, such new UAV system developed from this research also has provided a basis to develop site-specific precision fungicide application technology for control of this important disease in rice in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187470.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Disease assessment data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187470.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187470.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Ground truth data (0823).</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187470.s002.JPG"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187470.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Ground truth data (0830).</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187470.s003.JPG"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187470.s004"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Imagery data (0823&#x02013;0830).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187470.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We greatly thank Dr. Chenghai Yang at the USDA ARS-AATU for providing experimental devices, and Drs.
