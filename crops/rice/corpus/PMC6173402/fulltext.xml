Migration of the BPH have one of its roots in tropical Vietnam in the Mekong River Delta and the insecticide resistance status of BPH populations from Vietnam is thus important for East Asia. In the present investigation, we evaluate the susceptibility of BPH populations from nine provinces from the Red River Delta, the Central Coastal region and the Mekong River Delta of eight insecticides during 2015&#x02013;17. BPH field populations of Vietnam have developed a low to moderate level of resistance to the neonicotinoids dinotefuran, nitenpyram and imidacloprid, the pyrethroid etofenprox, the anticholinesterase fenobucarb, as well as fipronil and pymetrozine, and the growth regulator buprofezin. There was a correlation of in toxicology of fipronil, dinotefuran, etofenprox, buprofezin, which represents four different modes of action. The neonicotinoid nitenpyram, pymetrozine and fenobucarb did not show correlation in toxicology to any of the investigated insecticides. For most insecticides, a gradient of susceptibility was established from the Red River Delta in the north, through the Central Coastal region and to the Mekong River Delta in the south of Vietnam. The most susceptible populations were from the north. Insecticide resistance of the BPH populations in Vietnam is not at an alarming level and they are not the direct origin of high insecticide resistance found in East Asia. The cross-resistance pattern of BPH populations in Vietnam, where insecticides with different modes of action correlated, indicate that insecticides should be used with caution. There could be a buildup of a general metabolic resistance, which alone or in combination with the emergence of target-site resistance mutations will cause control problems. The results will be beneficial for development of resistance management strategies to prevent and delay development of insecticide resistance in BPH not only for Vietnam, but also for more northern Asian regions due the migration of BPH from tropical Vietnam.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>DANIDA</institution></funding-source><award-id>14-P01-VIE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khoa</surname><given-names>Dao Bach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Denmark's development cooperation DANIDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dfcentre.com/research/">http://dfcentre.com/research/</ext-link>) as part of the Denmark - Vietnam Research Cooperation Programme (RCP) 2013, Project: 14-P01-VIE.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. (Graminales: Poaceae), is one of the important stable foods feeding nearly half of the world population. The brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> St&#x000e5;l, (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is an important pest insect in most rice growing regions, especially in Asia. They damage rice directly through feeding causing hopper burns and by transmission of rice virus diseases such as grass stunt, ragged stunt and wilted stunt virus, respectively, e.g. causing yield loss of 2.7 million t during 2005&#x02013;2007 in China [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Vietnam is one of the major rice-exporting countries and rice-production covers about 7.75 million ha with a yield of 43.3 mill t per year [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Vietnam, BPH occurs in most of the rice-growing seasons and all regions. BPH caused serious hopper burns in Vietnam in 1978, 1991, 1992, 2006 and 2007 with losses of 700,000 t and 1 mill t in 2006 and 2007, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Due to diverse topography and tropical monsoon climate, rice is grown in three main regions in different seasons in Vietnam. In northern Vietnam, the Red River Delta has two main rice-growing seasons, winter-spring (Feb-May) and summer-autumn (Jun-Oct). The Central Coast region has two rice-growing seasons, winter-spring (Jan-Apr) and summer-autumn (May-Nov). In south Vietnam the rice-growing seasons constantly varies based on the weather condition, floods and the dike systems, but mostly the Mekong River Delta has three rice-growing seasons, winter-spring (Dec-Mar), summer-autumn (Apr-Jul) and autumn-winter (Aug-Nov).</p><p>The BPH is a long-distance migratory pest. At rice blooming stage, a long-winged, migratory form develops and mass migration follows. In East Asia, the migration of the BPH has root in the Mekong Delta in tropical Vietnam and in the Philippines. Migration of BPH from the Vietnamese root goes northwards through Central Vietnam and maybe also from neighbouring Laos to the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam, depending on weather conditions, especially the wind. This completes the &#x02018;first step migration&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This BPH population overwinters in the Red River Delta on rice and continues to migrate to southern China in the early summer [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where the BPH pest population builds up on the first Chinese rice crop. This then initiates the &#x02018;second step migration&#x02019; moving BPH populations to the Yangtze River Delta, the Korean Peninsula and Japan [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As the BPH moves northwards through a range of agro-ecological zones, a selection of genetic traits can be expected. This selection is influenced by the range of rice cultivars grown with varying BPH resistance phenotypes [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the control methods practiced, in the regions passed along the migration route. Exemplified by the 2005&#x02013;2007 outbreak, where initially BPH resistance to imidacloprid occurred suddenly at a high frequency, all the way from Vietnam to Japan, and insecticide usage increased by 10,000 t per year in Vietnam in 2006 and 2007 compared to 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A better understanding of BPH population properties of the emigration regions are needed, especially for insecticide resistance risk assessment and better pest management practices.</p><p>The control of BPH worldwide is relaying on chemical insecticides including organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids as well as newer chemicals. Misuse and overuse of chemical insecticides have caused a series of disadvantages, which involved ecological and social problems [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The BPH has high potential for insecticide resistance development due to its distinct biological and behavioural characteristics, such as short development time, high fecundity and dispersal capacity. BPH have developed resistance against many insecticides with different modes of action [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In the last decades rice production in Vietnam is intensifying and increasing the use of agrochemicals e.g. insecticides. Monitoring and understanding of insecticide resistance is essential for successful pest management and BPH is not an exception. In this study we investigate insecticide resistance of the three rice growing regions of Vietnam, where the insecticide resistance ration is described for three populations in each region during 2015, 2016 and 2017. Based on the frequency of insecticide usage, which is more frequent in the south a gradient of susceptibility is hypothesized to be established from north to south Vietnam. The most susceptible populations are expected in the north. Due to the intensive use of insecticides the susceptibility is hypothesized to decrease from spring to autumn and from 2015 to 2017. We additionally hypothesize that the selection process will follow a pattern when following the correlation of LC<sub>50</sub> and the slope of the dose-response regression line: i) an initial phase where the susceptible population will be characterized by a low LC<sub>50</sub> and a steep slope of the regression line (homogenous susceptible population, but with some natural variation), ii) a second phase where selection with an insecticide will initially decrease the slope substantially and increase the LC<sub>50</sub> slightly (heterogenous population, mixture of populations with different tolerance, iii) in the late stages of the selection of a resistance LC<sub>50</sub> will increase significantly and a steep slope of the regression line will appear again (homogenous resistant population, with limited variation).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Insects</title><p>The susceptible BPH population has been kept at the Plant Protection Research Institute in Hanoi since 1998.

About ten rice seeds were sow in cups that contain alluvial soil with supplying NPK nutrient. When seedling rice had four leaves they were used for bioassay. Agar powder was diluted according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction and allowed to cool to 37&#x000b0;C and then was poured on the rice seedling cups to cover the soil surface. Rice seedlings were dipped into six dose of insecticide solution for 30 s and kept at room temperature until the seedling dried (&#x0003e; 15 min). Ten third instar nymphs were transferred onto the rice seedling and the cup was covered with a plastic tube with a plastic mesh above. A test was replicated three times.

This yielded a total of 54 dose-response curves for each of the 8 insecticides. However, this number was reduced to 53 as the data from PhuYen in spring 2016 were discarded; they showed an aberrant, low susceptibility to all insecticides and were considered as a technical outlier.</p><p>Dose-response curves were estimated by regression for each insecticide separately using the R drc package [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This package does now allow the specification of a statistical design, so each singular regression was given a unique key to identify it by year, region, locality and season; the 3 replicates for each such combination were pooled. This allowed pairwise comparisons of the 53 regression curves, or fewer, as the model was reduced. Model reduction was carried out by constructing alternative keys, leaving out one or more of year, region, locality and season from the key. Alternative models were tested used the anova.drc function, choosing the simpler model if P&#x0003e;0.05. Finally, levels of year and levels of region were merged, if the pairwise comparisons from drc allowed (P&#x0003e;0.05). However, only levels adjacent in time (2015&#x02013;16 or 2016&#x02013;17) or space (north-central or south-central) were merged. Differences in the final, reduced models were taken as statistically significant at P&#x0003c;0.05 by way of the compParm function, using ratio comparison for LC<sub>50</sub> and difference comparison for slope. A dose-response curve was estimated separately for the susceptible laboratory strain for each insecticide.</p><p>Pearson correlation coefficients between LC<sub>50</sub>-values were computed for all pair-wise comparisons (n = 28) of insecticides using the R package "psych".

Initially, highly persistent organochlorines such as DDT (dichlordiphenyltrichlorethan) and BHC (benzene hexachloride) were used, but these insecticides have been banned since the 1970s due to environmental impact. Subsequently, the organophosphates and carbamates were widely used as control agents against BPH, but were replaced due to resistance. During the last decades pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, insect growth regulator and phenylpyrazole insecticides have been widely applied to control BPH. The extensive use of these insecticides evolved resistant populations of BPH and populations with high levels of resistance to the major classes of insecticides has emerged throughout Asia [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The Vietnam BPH populations have moderate anticholinesterase resistance levels, which are similar to the stable medium resistance levels observed in other Asian countries [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An earlier study from Vietnam showed a much higher level of variation among populations for fenobucarb toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which could be attributed to the use of topical application bioassay, which focuses more on intrinsic toxicological properties of the insecticide rather than the interaction of the pest with the insecticide in a simulated exposure situation. Anticholinesterase insecticides should be used with caution since resistance is prominent in many Asian countries. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the correlations between anticholinesterases and neonicotinoids, indicating cross-resistance possibly caused by detoxifying enzymes.</p><p>Pyrethroid resistance in the present study was low like in studies from China, Korea and Japan [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Pymetrozine, an azomethine pyridine insecticide, is extremely effective against sucking pest insects [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The moderate level of pymetrozine resistance without cross-resistance observed in China [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204962.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was decreasing in 2014&#x02013;15 [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The hypothesis of a gradient of susceptibility from the Red River Delta in the north to the Mekong River Delta in the south of Vietnam is not rejected. Mostly the highest resistance index is found in the south and the general trend is following the hypothesis. There was a significant geographic difference in toxicity for dinotefuran, imidacloprid, buprofezin, etofenprox and fipronil. Nitenpyram and fenobucarb did not show any geographic significant differences, whereas pymetrozine was unique with the lowest LC<sub>50</sub> values in the central provinces.</p><p>The hypothesized decreased susceptibility of BPH populations from 2015 to 2017 and from spring to autumn was largely not shown. In 2015, dinotefuran had a higher LC<sub>50</sub> in the south and central provinces compared to that in the north. Dinotefuran LC<sub>50</sub> decreased in 2016 and 2017. Etofenprox toxicity increased significantly in some years in some regions and also showed some seasonal differences, but generally there was not a trend of decreasing susceptibility. For fipronil, in 2016 in the northern provinces, LC<sub>50</sub> was significantly increased compared to 2015, but it decreased again in 2017. A similar decreasing fipronil toxicity was observed in the central and southern provinces in 2017.</p><p>Insecticide resistance in Vietnam is not at an alarming level and we did not even identify a single population with a very high level of resistance to any of the insecticides. This could be the result of a successful campaign to improve farmers&#x02019; pest management decisions in Vietnam, where print materials, such as pamphlets and posters, billboards, and radio and TV programs were designed to motivate farmers to avoid using insecticides in the first 40 days after sowing. These programs had positive effects on farmers&#x02019; beliefs, attitudes, and practices, reducing insecticide sprays by more than 50% [<xref rid="pone.0204962.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The eight insecticides investigated in BPH populations in Vietnam are at different stages of resistance development. Anticholinesterase resistance was probably established many decades ago and is at a homogenous stable level reflected by the low level of variation found on fenobucarb. Nitenpyram is at the other end of resistance development, mostly showing the natural variation of susceptibility. For fipronil, etofenprox, buprofezin, dinotefuran and imidacloprid we found heterogenous populations in the early stages of resistance selection increased LC<sub>50</sub> and low slope, as well as more homogenous populations, which have advanced in their resistance selection with further increased LC<sub>50</sub> values and steeper slopes.</p><p>The cross-resistance pattern of this survey showed that nitenpyram, pymetrozine and fenobucarb was not involved in any relationships. The cross-resistance of fipronil, etofenprox, buprofezin and the neonicotinoids dinotefuran and imidaclopird in this investigation should be noted and the background of this tolerance to multiple insecticides of different modes of action should be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, the cross-resistance pattern of BPH populations in Vietnam, where insecticides with different modes of action show correlation, indicate that insecticides should be used with caution. There could be a buildup of a troublesome general metabolic resistance, which alone or in combination with the emergence of target-site resistance mutation will cause control problems. Vietnam is not a focal point of insecticide resistance origin spreading throughout South-East Asia. The results will be beneficial for development of resistance management strategies to prevent and delay development of insecticide resistance in BPH not only from Vietnam, but also from countries in the more northern Asian regions due the migration of BPH from tropical Vietnam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204962.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Results of the bioassay with buprofenzin of BPH populations from North, Central and South Vietnam.</title><p>RI<sub>50</sub> were calculated by dividing LC<sub>50</sub> with AVG LC<sub>50</sub> (16.90) of the susceptible population.
