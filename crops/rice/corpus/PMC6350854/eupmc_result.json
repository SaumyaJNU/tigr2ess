    "Purpose:To characterize a biodegradable microsphere-hydrogel drug delivery system (DDS) for controlled and extended release of ranibizumab. Methods:The degradable microsphere-hydrogel DDSs were fabricated by suspending ranibizumab-loaded or blank poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres within a poly(ethylene glycol)-co-(L-lactic-acid) diacrylate/N-isopropylacrylamide (PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm) hydrogel. The thermal responsive behavior of various DDS formulations was characterized in terms of volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) and swelling ratios changes from 22°C to 42°C. The mechanical properties were characterized using rheological methods. Degradability of hydrogels were also examined via wet weight loss. Finally, Iodine-125 was used to radiolabel ranibizumab for characterization of encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release. Results:All DDS formulations investigated were injectable through a 28-gauge needle at room temperature. The VPTT increased with increase of cross-linker concentration. The swelling ratios decreased as temperature increased and were not influenced by presence of microspheres. Rheology data confirmed that increase of cross-linker concentration and microsphere loading made DDS stiffer. Increase of degradable cross-linker concentration facilitated hydrogel in vitro degradation. Controlled release of ranibizumab were achieved for investigated DDS formulations for 6 months; and increased degradable cross-linker concentration produced faster and more complete release. Conclusions:The biodegradable DDSs are suitable for sustained release of ranibizumab. Considering ease of injection, degradability and release of ranibizumab, DDS with 3 mM cross-linker concentration and less than 20 mg/mL microsphere loadings is more favorable for future application. Translational Relevance:The investigated DDS is promising for controlled and extended release of anti-VEGF therapeutics to achieve better treatment regimen in ocular neovascularizations."
