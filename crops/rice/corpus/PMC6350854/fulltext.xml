The VPTTs for PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with varying PEG-PLLA-DA concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) investigated in this study ranged from 31.5&#x000b0;C to 33.5&#x000b0;C, and increased with PEG-PLLA-DA concentrations. All of hydrogels were injectable through a 28G needle at room temperature and transformed to a solidified collapsed material after temperature increased to physiological level. It is well understood that the VPTT behavior of NIPAAm-based hydrogels results from a balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties in the polymer chains.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Hydrophilic moieties tend to increase the VPTT and hydrophobic moieties tend to lower the VPTT. The VPTT of PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with lowest PEG-PLLA-DA concentration (1 mM) was similar to the VPTT of pNIPAAm alone, which is reported as &#x0223c;32&#x000b0;C.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> And increased VPTT in hydrogels with higher PEG-PLLA-DA concentration can be attributed to the hydrophilic character of PEG group added to the pNIPAAm chains.</p><p>The above thermal transition behavior of PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels was also evaluated by changes in swelling ratios at different temperatures below and above their VPTTs. The swelling ratio for polymeric hydrogels determines their water content and is positively related to the molecular weight of the polymer chains between cross-links, which scales with the mesh size of hydrogel network.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Swelling ratios for PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with varying PEG-PLLA-DA concentrations decreased as temperature increased above their VPTTs. This indicated that hydrogels started to lose water and collapsed due to more dominant hydrophobic polymer&#x02013;polymer interaction at higher temperatures. Since the mesh size of hydrogels are well known to be proportional to the swelling ratios,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> this decrease in swelling ratios above VPTTs indicates a decrease of hydrogels' mesh size, which is favorable for sustained drug release. The decrease in swelling ratios and loss of water create convective flow and contribute to IB drug release. Interestingly, hydrogels with higher PEG-PLLA-DA concentration exhibited higher swelling ratios at investigated temperatures. This is opposite to the swelling of PEG-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels, where higher PEG-DA concentrations made hydrogel more rigid and less swelling.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> One possible explanation for this increased swelling at higher PEG-PLLA-DA cross-link concentration is that the higher MW of PEG-PLLA-DA (&#x0223c;4288 g/mol) comparing to MW of PEG-DA (575 g/mol) produced longer polymer chains after copolymerization with pNIPAAm. This would result in larger space between cross-links allowing for more water exposure and enhanced hydrophilic character of PEG groups added to the pNIPAAm chains. Therefore, hydrogels became more swollen and less responsive to temperature changes at higher PEG-PLLA-DA concentration. In addition, we observed no effects of microsphere load amount on hydrogel's temperature-dependent swelling behavior. The 3 mM PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with three different microsphere load amount (0, 10, and 20 mg/mL) exhibited similar swelling ratios with increasing of temperature. This indicated that presence of microspheres inside the hydrogels' network, at least at concentration up to 20 mg/mL, did not influence hydrogels' water content and thermoresponsive behavior, which is of great importance for microspheres' delivery and localization.</p><p>The mechanical properties of PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with and without microspheres were characterized using small-amplitude oscillatory motion rheometry. The strain amplitude used for frequency sweeps test was 1%, and this was validated by results of strain dependence test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-f03">Figure 3a</xref> as the sample stayed well in the linear viscoelastic deformation range. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-f03">Figure 3b</xref>, which showed the effects of PEG-PLLA-DA cross-linker concentration on G&#x02032; and G&#x02033;, we observed that increasing cross-linker concentration caused an increase in elastic moduli than in loss moduli, which means higher G&#x02033;/G&#x02032; ratio at higher cross-linker concentration. The results suggested that increasing cross-linker concentration will make hydrogels more solid-like and difficult to inject through small gauge needles. This is in agreement with our preliminary studies, where we found that hydrogels with PEG-PLLA-DA concentrations beyond 3 mM are difficult to be injected through 28-gauge needles. All hydrogels investigated were elastic, demonstrated by higher storage moduli than loss moduli regardless of cross-linker concentration. In addition, the hydrogels in this study were designed to serve as injectable carriers for microspheres; therefore, it is important that the encapsulation of microspheres should not affect injectability of the system. We observed no differences in both G&#x02032; and G&#x02033; comparing 3 mM PEG-PLLA-DA/NIPAAm hydrogels with 10 mg/mL microspheres to those without microspheres. However, hydrogels with higher microsphere load (i.e., 20 mg/mL) presented increased G&#x02032; and G&#x02033;&#x02014;with more increase in G&#x02032; than G&#x02033;&#x02014; over the high frequency range (&#x0003e;10 rad/s). The current data suggest that microsphere load greater than 20 mg/mL can influence the mechanical properties and injectability. Considering the above results, 10 mg/mL was chosen as microsphere load amount for in vitro release study.</p><p>At the end of study (190 days), the shape of hydrogels started to disintegrate into amorphous polymers. We speculate that the hydrolytically degradable cross-linker PEG-PLLA-DA, which is important for maintaining hydrogels' shape integrity, has been hydrolyzed and the remaining PNIPAAm chains are still held together by physical cross-links formed through hydrophobic interactions. This hydrophobic interaction was confirmed when we lowered the temperature below hydrogels' VPTTs at the end of degradation (after 190 days of incubation), the remaining polymers became transparent and soluble. It is worth noting that the degradation of hydrogels was relatively faster during the first month, then became much slower before losing their shape integrity. This slow degradation was desirable for localizing the encapsulated microspheres since the complete degradation of microspheres take &#x0223c;154 days.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Biocompatibility of the materials used in the DDSs is an important consideration.

We believe that increase of degradable cross-linker concentration in hydrogels would further facilitate a complete drug release; however, the downside is a decreased injectability through a small gauge needle.</p><p>The microsphere-hydrogel DDSs with varied degradable cross-linker concentrations exhibited similar IB release of &#x0223c;20%, which is also comparable to IB release of ranibizumab from the nondegradable system (21.0% &#x000b1; 2.0%).<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This IB release of encapsulated ranibizumab is most likely caused by convective mass transport of ranibizumab bound to the surface of microspheres, and free drugs in the hydrogels network, if any.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This convective flow resulted from the quick loss of water during collapse of hydrogels' network as the temperature increased above the VPTTs, which was demonstrated by decrease in hydrogels' swelling ratios as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-f02">Figure 2</xref>. It is worth pointing out that the IB release of anti-VEGF could be favorable in neutralizing initial higher amount of VEGF at the beginning of treatment for ocular neovascularization.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The release rate of ranibizumab after first week was found to be well controlled by degradable cross-linker concentration; DDSs with higher degradable cross-linker concentration presented faster daily release. The common triphasic release profiles from microspheres<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> were not seen in these microsphere-hydrogel composite systems. In our system, steady zero-order release profiles were achieved for all cross-linker concentrations after 7 days, which supports our hypothesis that hydrogels act as a second barrier to further control and sustain the release of drug.</p><p>Clinical dosage of ranibizumab is 0.5 mg per IVT injection, with very high initial IVT drug concentration. The vitreous concentration of ranibizumab declined in a close to mono-exponential manner with a half-life of &#x0223c;3 days, and less than 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL ranibizumab were still maintained in the vitreous humor after 1 month.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> DDSs in this work have an initial release of 2.28 to 3.31 &#x003bc;g within 24 hours and a steady state release of 0.02 to 0.04 &#x003bc;g/day. Given that ranibizumab exhibits strong binding affinity to VEGF at 2.4 ng/mL, and IC<sub>50</sub> for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was reported to be 54.72 ng/mL,<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we hypothesize that this sustained low dose release will have a therapeutic effect. In addition, the dosage of our DDSs can also be increased and adjusted by either initial drug stock solution concentration or microsphere load amount. Future in vivo efficacy of the DDSs is planned in appropriate animal models.</p><p>There are variety of DDSs for sustained anti-VEGF release currently under development. For example, refillable rigid port delivery system (RPDS) developed by Forsight Vision4 and Genentech is in clinical trials for evaluating safety and efficacy in treatment of wet AMD.<xref rid="i2164-2591-8-1-12-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> RPDS is an IVT implant that is the size of a grain of rice. It consists of a subconjunctival refill port outside of the eye and an IVT reservoir preloaded with drug. One of the biggest advantages of RPDS is that on-demand refills can be performed in an in-office procedure using a customized exchange needle. However, since the drug reservoir is nonbiodegradable, both surgical implantation and removal are required, which may increase risks of complications. Comparing to RPDS, the major advantage of the microsphere-hydrogel DDS presented in this work is that no surgical implantation and removal are needed since the system can be injectable through a small gauge needle and is biodegradable. In addition, other advantages are adjustable release dosage from microsphere loading and reproducible and linear release with low IB. However, maintaining drug bioactivity over the long-term release for both systems needs to be addressed in future.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study characterized important biomaterial parameters of a degradable microsphere-hydrogel DDS for controlled and extended release of ranibizumab. The VPTTs of degradable thermoresponsive hydrogels were below physiological temperature and suitable for injection through 28G needles. This thermoresponsive behavior was also reflected by hydrogels' temperature-dependent swelling ratios, and the microspheres did not influence the hydrogels' swelling. The mechanical properties of hydrogels were found to be related to their cross-linker density; higher cross-linker density investigated in this study gave more solid-like behavior. Higher microsphere load amount (&#x0003e;20 mg/mL) could also potentially make DDS stiffer and more difficult to inject, which should be carefully considered before clinical applications. By controlling the degradable cross-linker (PEG-PLLA-DA) concentrations for hydrogels, we were able to control the release rate and final percent release of ranibizumab. Higher degradability of hydrogels produced faster drug release rate and prompted more complete release. Considering the ease of injectability and more complete release of ranibizumab, hydrogels with 3 mM PEG-PLLA-DA concentration and microsphere load amount (10 mg/mL) seemed more favorable for sustained delivery of ranibizumab. Our degradable DDS is promising for controlled and extended localized release of anti-VEGF therapeutics to achieve better treatment regimen in chronic ocular diseases such as AMD and other ocular neovascularizations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH/NEI (EY0254-34) research grant.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>W.
