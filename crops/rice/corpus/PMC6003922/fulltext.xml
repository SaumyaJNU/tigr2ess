APX plays a central role in the elimination of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protects plants from the oxidative damage that can occur as a result of biotic and abiotic stresses. At present, the only known function of APX is as a peroxidase. However, in this study, we demonstrate that <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> APX2 also operates as a molecular chaperone in rice. The different functions of OsAPX2 correlate strongly with its structural conformation. The high-molecular-weight (HMW) complexes had chaperone activity, whereas the low-molecular-weight (LMW) forms displayed predominantly APX activity. The APX activity was effectively inhibited by sodium azide, which is an inhibitor of haem-containing enzymes, but this did not affect the protein&#x02019;s activity as a chaperone. Additionally, the OsAPX2 conformational changes could be regulated by salt and heat stresses and these stimulated OsAPX2 dissociation and association, respectively. Our results provide new insight into the roles of APXs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is one of the most important crops in the world and is cultivated in a range of agro-climatic conditions. Therefore, rice plants encounter a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses. These stresses increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during adverse conditions and generate oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Most organisms, including rice, have evolved effective mechanisms for managing these potentially damaging increases in ROS. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) is one of the most important of these defence components and can detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> Rice has eight <italic>APX</italic> genes and these encode enzymes that function in the cytosol (APX1 and APX2), peroxisome (APX3 and APX4), mitochondria (APX5 and APX6) and chloroplast (APX7 and APX8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated that a variety of APX enzymes can detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in specific locations within different organisms in response to a range of external stimuli. The expression of these genes is regulated by a variety of stress factors, suggesting that APXs play important roles in plant stress resistance. Chloroplast APXs are generally more sensitive than cytosolic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and although there are no corresponding data on rice APXs, chloroplastic APXs from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and green algae are highly susceptible to photooxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Previous studies of mutations in cytosolic APX1 and APX2 confirmed that these enzymes are crucial for counteracting abiotic stress during plant growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Under normal growth conditions, <italic>APX2</italic> expression is difficult to detect but it is significantly upregulated in response to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Overexpression of <italic>APX2</italic> is reportedly linked with improvements in salt tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Medicago sativa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, a gene knockout study demonstrated the critical role that OsAPX2 plays in rice plants growing under drought, high-salt or cold stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and another study reported that transgenic alfalfa overexpressing the <italic>OsAPX2</italic> gene had an increased capacity for salt tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">We previously demonstrated, using an in-gel enzyme assay, that APX activity in the shoot tissue of a salt-sensitive rice cultivar (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. cv. IR29) increased significantly in response to salt treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. During salt stress, the OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 isoenzymes played critical roles in eliminating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the IR29 cultivar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Our studies, using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), found that recombinant OsAPX1 and OsAPX2 proteins had a variety of forms with different molecular weights (data not shown). This resembled results from previous studies on 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx) reported by K&#x000f6;nig <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and Jang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. One of the Prx antioxidant proteins had a dual function as both a peroxidase and a chaperone and its enzymatic activity was regulated by its structural status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The 2-Cys Prx regulated its own structure in a redox-dependent manner. The oxidized form of the 2-Cys Prx was a low-molecular-weight (LMW) dimer; however, reduced and hyper-oxidised dimers formed high-molecular-weight (HMW) complexes (e.g., decamers or dodecamers). These dynamic changes were closely related to functional switching between the protein acting as a peroxidase and a molecular chaperone. The LMW complexes had high peroxidase activity, whereas the HMW complexes functioned predominantly as chaperones.</p><p id="Par4">To date, functional studies of APX proteins have been restricted to their antioxidant properties. However, in this study, we identify a novel function for APX proteins as molecular chaperones and also reveal the relationship between the structure and different functions of an APX protein. The different functions of OsAPX2 are strongly dependent on its structure. APX activity was greatest in the LMW protein forms, whereas the molecular chaperone activity predominated in the HMW complexes. Additionally, APX activity was not required for OsAPX2&#x02019;s chaperone activity. The HMW complexes and LMW forms were regulated by heat stress <italic>in vitro</italic> and by salt treatment in the IR29 cultivar. Therefore, our results provide new insight into the functions of APXs to study in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>OsAPX2 forms multiple structures of different sizes</title><p id="Par5">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the structural analyses of recombinant OsAPX2 protein using reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and native-PAGE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) followed by SEC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Large amounts of purified protein were obtained under reducing conditions and the OsAPX2 protein was present as a monomer of approximately 27&#x02009;kDa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). On the native gel, OsAPX2 protein was present in an LMW form and in HMW complexes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). To investigate the native structures of these proteins in more detail, we performed SEC analysis using FPLC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The OsAPX2 proteins were separated into four fractions corresponding to the major dimeric form (F4), the LMW forms (F2 and F3), and the HMW complexes (F1). Each of these fractions corresponded to a peak in the SEC analysis and was further analyzed by native-PAGE. The proteins in the first SEC fraction (F1&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;kDa), which contained the largest OsAPX2 complexes, were too large for 10% native-PAGE and were retained at the top of the separating gel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, inset). The F2 and F3 forms had molecular weights between 158 and 440&#x02009;kDa. F2 and F3 have a molecular weight close to 440&#x02009;kDa and 158&#x02009;kDa, respectively. Although it is difficult to precisely separate F2 and F3, F2 has a molecular weight greater than F3. The major-peak (F4) proteins eluted at a position corresponding to the dimeric forms (approximately 54&#x02009;kDa). In contrast to the native-PAGE analysis, reducing SDS-PAGE of all fractions resulted in a single 27&#x02009;kDa band corresponding to the OsAPX2 protein monomer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, inset, lower panel).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural analysis of the recombinant <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> ascorbate peroxidase 2 (OsAPX2) protein.

We found that the proteins were eluted with nearly the same retention times that they had in the first SEC analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which suggests that the structures of these proteins remained relatively stable during experimentation <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown).</p><p id="Par10">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> illustrates that APX activity in the F4 fraction (which consisted mainly of dimeric protein; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) was highest compared with the other fractions and with the total protein extract.

However, salt stress disrupted the majority of the OsAPX2 HMW complexes, which transformed into the dimeric and LMW forms, indicating that the regulation of OsAPX2 activity might differ from that of 2-Cys Prx activity.

The purified OsAPX2 proteins were treated for 10&#x02009;min at various temperatures.

These results suggest that the dual functions of OsAPX2 are closely linked to conformational changes in the protein that are modulated by salt (dissociation) and heat (association) stresses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">APX is one of the key enzymes regulating the level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In plants, the APXs are classified according to their cellular location, with OsAPX2 being found in the cytosol. This study demonstrates that OsAPX2 can act as a molecular chaperone in addition to its primary function as a peroxidase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the dual functions of OsAPX2 as a molecular chaperone and peroxidase. However, previous studies have shown that 2-Cys Prx, another H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxifying enzyme, has dual functions as a molecular chaperone and peroxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Similar structural changes were observed in OsAPX2, and native-PAGE and SEC analyses showed that OsAPX2 could also exist in different conformational states. Therefore, the dual functionality of OsAPX2 could have a structural basis similar to that underlying the different roles played by 2-Cys Prx proteins.</p><p id="Par15">This study has confirmed that the dual functions of OsAPX2 are closely associated with changes in its protein structure. Extracts of the recombinant OsAPX2 protein were separated into different fractions based on molecular weight. The fraction containing predominantly dimeric proteins showed the highest APX activity, whereas the fraction containing mostly HMW complexes had the highest chaperone activity. These results clearly indicate that oligomerization of the OsAPX2 protein promotes molecular chaperone activity, whereas the LMW forms are more strongly linked with APX activity. Therefore, as with the 2-Cys Prx proteins, the dual functions of OsAPX2 are associated with the protein&#x02019;s capacity to adopt different structural conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">APX contains a haem group that plays a key role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, whereas particular regions of the polypeptide chain may be more important for other functions of OsAPX2, including its role as a molecular chaperone. Sodium azide inhibits haem-containing enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and treating the OsAPX2 protein with sodium azide completely inhibited its APX activity but did not affect its activity as a molecular chaperone. Because the molecular chaperone activity of sodium azide-treated OsAPX2 protein was unaffected, this activity does not require a functional haem group.</p><p id="Par17">The structural changes in the OsAPX2 protein can apparently be modulated by different environmental conditions. We monitored the <italic>in vivo</italic> structural status of OsAPX2 under various abiotic stress conditions and found that it could be altered by salinity stress. OsAPX2 proteins extracted from the salt-sensitive rice cultivar IR29 were mainly present in the HMW form, whereas exposure to salt stress converted them into the dimeric and LMW forms that are associated with APX activity. The proteins reverted to their predominantly HMW form when the salt stress was withdrawn. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> reported total APX activity, redox status, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in the salt-sensitive rice seedling IR-29 following salt treatment (100&#x02009;mM NaCl). Total APX activity was significantly increased in the leaves and roots of IR-29 following salt treatment. The ratio of reduced/oxidized ascorbate was also reduced in IR-29. As ascorbate is oxidized in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging reaction by APX, the decreased ratio is likely due to the increase in APX activity. Additionally, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content of the leaves and roots of IR-29 was decreased. The low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content following salt treatment could be partially accounted for by the increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-scavenging activity. Therefore, our results can be linked to the functional and structural changes of OsAPX2 in IR-29 following salt stress. Under salt stress, it is likely that the HMW complexes of OsAPX2 can switch to the LMW form to increase APX activity.</p><p id="Par18">In addition, to investigate the MW switching of OsAPX2 in a salt-insensitive rice cultivar in response to salt stress, we selected the salt-tolerant rice cultivar Pokkali, which was obtained from the International Rice Research Institute (Los Ba&#x000f1;os, Philippines). To determine the structural status of OsAPX2 and its response to salt treatment (100&#x02009;mM NaCl), we performed native-PAGE and western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Like IR-29, under normal condition, the OsAPX2 in the salt-tolerant cultivar Pokkali was present primarily in HMW complexes. In IR-29 (salt-sensitive), OsAPX2 mainly formed HMW complexes with very few LMW proteins; salt stress broke down the majority of the HMW complexes into dimeric and LMW forms. However, unlike in IR-29, the protein structure in Pokkali did not change following salt treatment with 100&#x02009;mM NaCl and subsequent recovery. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> reported that two rice cultivars, IR-29 and Pokkali, undergo different morphological and biochemical changes under salt stress. Following salt treatment with 100&#x02009;mM NaCl, IR-29 showed structural damage to chloroplasts and a decrease in photosynthetic activity but showed little physiological damage in Pokkali despite increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The MW switching of OsAPX2 from HMW complexes to dimeric and LMW forms seems to occur in salt-sensitive rice to overcome salt stress in conjunction with increased APX activity.</p><p id="Par19">In the present study, because most OsAPX2 proteins present <italic>in vivo</italic> adopted the HMW form, purified OsAPX2 was used to investigate the effect of heat stress. The data showed that increasing the temperature gradually increased the proportion of HMW OsAPX2 and there was a corresponding decrease in the LMW protein form. We can conclude that OsAPX2 has dual functions as both a chaperone and APX and that these are associated with the HMW and LMW forms of the protein, respectively. Additionally, structural changes in the protein can be triggered by external environmental conditions. However, further experiments will be required to describe precisely the mechanisms that modulate the structural and functional alterations in OsAPX2 that are stimulated by changes in temperature and salinity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that the purified OsAPX2 protein exhibited a new function as a molecular chaperone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Molecular chaperone activity was exhibited predominantly by the HMW form, which was prone to switching by heat stress <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, it was difficult to prove the MW switching of OsAPX2 following heat stress in rice. Since the predominant form of OsAPX2 was the HMW form, a different form induced by heat stress, in normal conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. We do not currently understand why the mechanism of association of OsAPX2 is different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. It will be necessary to explore this in future studies. However, the present study strongly suggests that OsAPX2 has various structures, that the LMW form functions as a strong peroxidase, and that the HMW form acts as a molecular chaperone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Model showing the salt- and heat-dependent structural changes that occur during the conversions between the LMW and HMW forms of OsAPX2.
