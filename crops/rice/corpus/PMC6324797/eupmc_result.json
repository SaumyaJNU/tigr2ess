    "Increasing amounts of crop residues are being returned to croplands. Understanding nitrogen (N) availability in crop residues under various N fertilization regimes is important in optimizing N management. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution, fate and residual effects of urea and maize residue-N using a 15N isotope technique. Four N regimes were tested: three basal-topdressing ratios of N applied as urea (100-0, 75-25, 50-50) and one basal application of 75% N as urea and 25% N as manure (75U+25M). An average of 31.4% wheat N uptake was derived from urea, 9.2% from maize residue, and 59.5% from the soil in the first season. During the growing stages of wheat, maize residue contributed 0.3-4.8% and 3.1-13.2% to soil mineral and microbial biomass N, respectively, and those originated from urea was 1.0-4.2% and 4.6-16.8%, respectively. Regarding the fate of urea and residue-N after the first season, 35.9% and 16.9% of urea-15N and residue-15N were recovered by wheat, 28.1% and 46.9% remained in the soil, and 36.0% and 36.2% were lost. The contribution of urea to crop N uptake and N recovery efficiency increased, while that of residue-N decreased with increasing proportion of topdressing N. Substituting 25% mineral N with manure decreased the urea-15N loss without negative effects on crop dry matter and N uptake. Residual urea-15N and maize residue-15N from the previous season contributed 3.9% and 3.0% to summer maize N uptake. Additionally, 29.3% of residue-15N remained in the soil after the second season, while only 18.6% of urea-15N remained. Our study suggests that fertilizer and crop residue are actively involved in soil N transformation and plant N nutrition, emphasizing the capacities of organic residues to sustainably supply nutrients. Considering the utilization of both N fertilizer and maize residue, we may suggest a 75-25 split in N fertilizer application, but more appropriate options need to be further assessed under different cropping systems."
