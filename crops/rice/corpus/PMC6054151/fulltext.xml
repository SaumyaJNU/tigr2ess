Sudden low temperature events that often occur during early seedling development in spring can directly affect chlorophyll development (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kusumi and Iba, 2014</xref>). Rice seedlings are susceptible to cold stress, with an impact that ultimately affects grain yield (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Therefore, cold stress is a common problem that affects grain production, and rice varieties with increased cold tolerance are preferred (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Many studies have suggested that plants can regulate early chloroplast development under cold stress. The chlorophyll content in young leaves of a virescent mutant was low, but gradually increased to normal levels as they grew (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Temperature-sensitive virescent mutants were used to study mechanisms regulating chloroplast development in seedlings under cold stress, and many genes were identified (e.g. <italic>V3</italic>, <italic>St1</italic>, <italic>OsV4</italic>, <italic>TCD9</italic>, and <italic>TSV</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms of chloroplast development in rice seedlings under cold stress remain poorly understood.</p><p>Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and have crucial roles in plant development and growth by fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> and biosynthesis of carbon skeletons, as well as other physiological processes (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis and L&#x000f3;pez-Juez, 2013</xref>). Formation of a photosynthetically active chloroplast from a proplastid is controlled by both nuclear-encoded polymerase (NEP) and plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP) genes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). NEP is a single protein that is responsible for the transcription of genes encoding PEP subunits, ribosomal proteins, and other plastidic &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; proteins (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Liere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). PEP, on the other hand, is a large, dynamic complex with many transiently attached peripheral subunits (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Chloroplast RNAs need to be processed to become functional rRNAs and mRNAs. Many of the processing factors for RNA cleavage, splicing, editing, and stability are RNA-binding proteins (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tillich and Krause, 2010</xref>). All are encoded by the nuclear genome. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a family of RNA-binding proteins that usually carry out specific RNA processing in chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Stern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Shikanai and Fujii, 2013</xref>). PPR proteins are defined by tandem arrays of a degenerate 35 amino acid repeat (PPR motif). In higher plants, the PPR family comprises many members, with 450 in Arabidopsis and 655 in rice (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Toole <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The functions of PPR proteins are well characterized (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Stern <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Shikanai and Fujii, 2013</xref>). Chloroplast-targeted PPR proteins were characterized as being involved in regulating RNA splicing, RNA editing, RNA stability, and RNA translation during plant development and growth (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ichinose <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Several PPR genes in rice, such as <italic>YSA</italic>, <italic>OsV4</italic>, <italic>WSL</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic>, <italic>OspTAC2</italic>, and <italic>WSL4</italic>, were reported to function in RNA editing, RNA splicing and chloroplast development (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Su <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; D. <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The rice PPR mutant <italic>ysa</italic> develops albinic leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the plants gradually turn green and recover to normal green at the six-leaf stage (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Su <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <italic>WSL</italic> encodes a PPR protein that is targeted to the chloroplast and plays an essential role in the splicing of <italic>rpl2</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The P-family PPR mutant <italic>wsl4</italic>, which exhibits white-striped leaves before the five-leaf stage, has defective chloroplast RNA group II intron splicing (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, the functions, substrates, and regulatory mechanisms of many PPR proteins in rice remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we isolated and characterized the rice mutant <italic>wsl5</italic> that develops white-striped leaves at the early seedling stage. <italic>wsl5</italic> is albinic under low temperatures. <italic>WSL5</italic> encodes a P-family PPR protein containing an RNA recognition motif (RRM) at its N-terminus and 15 PPR motifs at its C-terminus. WSL5 locates to the chloroplast and is essential for chloroplast ribosome biogenesis under cold stress. We showed that RNA editing sites of <italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>atpA</italic> were not edited, and plastid-encoded genes <italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>rps12</italic> were not efficiently spliced in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant. Abnormal splicing of <italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>rps12</italic> may lead to chloroplast failure to form functional ribosomes, which blocks retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus.

<italic>WSL5</italic> encodes a chloroplast-targeted PPR protein that is essential for chloroplast development in juvenile plants under cold stress</title><p>PPR genes constitute a large multigene family in higher plants. PPR proteins are essential for plant growth and development, and most of them are involved in RNA editing, splicing, and regulation of stability of various organellar transcripts (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Barkan and Small, 2014</xref>). In contrast to PPRs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, little is known about the functions of PPRs in rice. Here, we present a molecular characterization of the PPR gene <italic>WSL5</italic> in rice. It has an RRM and 15 PPR motifs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Fig. S3</ext-link> at Dryad). The WSL5 protein was predicted to contain a chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) in its N-terminal region, suggesting that the protein is one of the PPRs targeted to chloroplasts, and this was confirmed by subcellular localization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The disruption of <italic>WSL5</italic> under natural conditions led to abnormal chloroplasts and caused a variegated phenotype that affected both the chlorophyll content and the chloroplast ultrastructure up to the four-leaf stage, whereas the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant was albinic under cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Fig. S2</ext-link> at Dryad). This finding suggests that the function of <italic>WSL5</italic> in rice is essential for early chloroplast development under cold stress. This conclusion is further supported by the results of expression analysis. <italic>WSL5</italic> was highly expressed in leaf sections L3 and L4 at the seedling stage. A high level of <italic>WSL5</italic> was noted under low temperatures. Sequence alignment of homologous proteins using <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, maize, and rice showed that the mutant site in <italic>wsl5</italic> is conserved within the RRM motif.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>WSL5 is involved in splicing of plastidic genes and in ribosome biosynthesis</title><p>A large group of nuclear-encoded PPR proteins involved in RNA editing, splicing, stability, maturation, and translation is required for chloroplast development (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). To date, six PPR proteins have been reported to be involved in RNA splicing of group II introns in chloroplasts. Among them, the maize PPR4 protein acts as an <italic>rps12</italic> trans-splicing factor (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz-Linneweber <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> PPR protein OTP51 functions as a plastid <italic>ycf3-2</italic> intron <italic>cis</italic>-splicing factor and OTP70 has been implicated in splicing of plastid transcript <italic>rpoC1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">de Longevialle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chateigner-Boutin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In this study, the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant caused defects in the splicing of <italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>rps12</italic> in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), implying that WSL5 probably controls chloroplast RNA intron splicing during early leaf development. The majority of those splicing factors act on distinct, but overlapping, intron subsets, and each intron has been shown to require multiple proteins (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">de Longevialle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Khrouchtchova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In rice, WSL can splice <italic>rpl2</italic>, while WSL4 can splice <italic>rpl2</italic> and <italic>rps12</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). WSL5 could not interact with WSL and WSL4 in the yeast system (data not shown). These three proteins are all involved in the splicing of <italic>rpl2</italic>. There is no functional redundancy among them. There may be an unknown regulatory mechanism to control the function of these three proteins. Further studies on searching for interacting partners of WSL5 will help to uncover the regulatory mechanism of the splicing of chloroplast genes.</p><p>Defective <italic>rps12</italic> and <italic>rpl2</italic> splicing could account for the white-stripe leaf phenotype and plastid ribosome deficiency in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). We found that 23S and 16S rRNAs were decreased in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant under cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">F</xref>). The lack of mature <italic>rps12</italic> and <italic>rpl2</italic> mRNA in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant may severely affect ribosome functions in plastids. The absence of RPL2 and RPS12 protein resulted in the inability to make functional ribosomes. Thus, the ribosome assembly defect in <italic>wsl5</italic> may also contribute to the <italic>wsl5</italic> phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Possible mechanism of <italic>WSL5</italic> regulating chloroplast development under cold stress and normal conditions</title><p>To study the molecular mechanism of <italic>WSL5</italic> in regulating chloroplast development under different temperature conditions, we compared gene expression patterns in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant and wild type by RNA-seq analysis. Our findings showed that under cold stress, <italic>WSL5</italic> influences the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, oxidation&#x02013;reduction processes, photosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, chlorophyll biosynthesis process, and chloroplast development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Dataset S2</ext-link> at Dryad). Plastid thioredoxins are important for maintaining plastid oxidation&#x02013;reduction balance (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bohrer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Many genes involved in regulating plastid oxidation&#x02013;reduction balance were changed under C20 and C30 conditons, such as <italic>OsTRXm</italic> and <italic>OsTRXz</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Fig. S10</ext-link> at Dryad). <italic>OsTRXm</italic> is involved in regulation of activity of a target peroxiredoxin (Prx) through reduction of cysteine disulfide bridges (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). OsTRXz interacts with TSV to protect chloroplast development under cold stress (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), V3 and St1, regulate the rate of deoxyribonucleotide production for DNA synthesis and repair (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). <italic>V3</italic> and <italic>St1</italic> are repressed at constant 20 &#x000b0;C in <italic>wsl5</italic>, indicating that mutation in <italic>WSL5</italic> leads to defects in DNA synthesis and repair in juvenile plants at low temperatures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Fig. S10</ext-link> at Dryad). The expression of fatty acid metabolism genes <italic>OsFAH1</italic>, <italic>OsFAH2</italic>, and <italic>OsFAD7</italic>, and plastid starch metabolism genes <italic>AGPS2b</italic> and <italic>PHO1</italic>, was dramatically changed in <italic>wsl5</italic> compared with the wild type at low temperatures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">Fig. S10</ext-link> at Dryad). Chloroplast development depends on co-operation between nuclear and chloroplast genes. The altered expression of these nuclear genes in the <italic>wsl5</italic> mutant may be due to the absence of RPL2 and RPS12 proteins and thereby impede the transfer of retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus.</p><p>In conclusion, <italic>WSL5</italic> influences the expression of plastid genes and biogenesis of plastid ribosomes. It is essential for chloroplast development in rice seedlings under cold stress by maintaining the retrograde signaling from plastids to the nucleus. Identification of this new PPR protein will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of plastid development and ribosome biogenesis, and shed light on understanding chloroplast development in juvenile plants under cold stress.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s29"><title>Data deposition</title><p>The following data are available at Dryad Data Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.59185</ext-link>.</p><p>
