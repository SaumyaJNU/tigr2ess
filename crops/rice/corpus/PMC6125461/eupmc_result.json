    "Single segment substitution lines (SSSLs) have been confirmed to be powerful tools to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. This study illuminated the process and methods of QTL analysis with SSSLs on heading date (HD) in rice. QTL identification under two cropping seasons revealed 98 of 202 SSSLs associated with HD. A total of 22 QTLs were positioned in relative narrow regions on chromosomes by mrMLM.GUI software. QTL qHd3-1 was precisely positioned at 4.4â€‰cM on chromosome 3 by a secondary F2 population. Through SSSL pyramiding, double segment substitution lines were constructed and used to analyze epistatic interactions of digenic loci. Epistatic effects for three pairs of QTLs were estimated, indicating the interactions of QTL qHd3-1 with other QTLs detected and the role to enhance the expression of early ripening or restraining of late flowering QTLs. Additionally, analysis of QTL in different environments provided information about the stability of HD QTLs. This type of research points out the way to excavate favorable genes for design breeding."
