The present study was conducted on cacao (<italic>Theobroma cacao</italic>), the source of chocolate, and one of the crops known to accumulate Cd in certain conditions. There are a range of possible genetic and agronomic methods being tested as a route to such reduction. As part of a gene-based approach, we focused on the Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Proteins (NRAMPS), a family of proton/metal transporter proteins that are evolutionarily conserved across all species from bacteria to humans. The plant <italic>NRAMP</italic> gene family are of particular importance as they are responsible for uptake of the nutritionally vital divalent cations Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as well as Cd<sup>2+</sup>. We identified the five <italic>NRAMP</italic> genes in cacao, sequenced these genes and studied their expression in various organs. We then confirmed the expression patterns in response to variation in nutrient cation availability and addition of Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Functional analysis by expression in yeast provided evidence that <italic>NRAMP5</italic> encoded a protein capable of Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport, and suggested this gene as a target for genetic selection/modification.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mars Wrigley Confectionery Cocoa research UK</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026;amp; Human Services | National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-GM056285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eide</surname><given-names>David J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mars Wrigley Confectionery Ciocoa Research UK</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Proteins (NRAMPS) represent a family of proton/metal transporter proteins that are evolutionarily conserved across all species from bacteria to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The plant NRAMP gene family are of particular importance as they are responsible for uptake of the nutritionally vital divalent cations Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Cd<sup>2+</sup> a toxic metal with no known role in plant growth and development. Cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) is present in the agricultural environment from either geological sources, industrial pollution, or from the application of rock phosphate fertiliser, which can contain relatively high levels of Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Humans absorb plant-derived Cd<sup>2+</sup> either from their diet, or from smoking, and it accumulates in the body during life. Because of the known ill effects of Cd<sup>2+</sup> there has been much global regulatory pressure in recent years to reduce human exposure, and this has focused attention on those food ingredients, including cereals and cereal products, vegetables, nuts and pulses, starchy roots or potatoes, and meat and meat products, which are the main source of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in the diet. Of specific relevance is the decision of the EU regulatory authorities to reduce from 2019 the permissible levels of dietary Cd<sup>2+</sup> (Commission Regulation (EU) no 488/2014). In an attempt to reduce the levels of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in crops, including cacao (the source of chocolate), a variety of research studies are underway to develop agronomic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> or genetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> solutions to this problem.</p><p id="Par3">This present study focused on the characterization of the NRAMP gene family in cacao and was designed to investigate the possible role of these proteins in controlling levels of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in this crop. It involved an initial survey of the gene family across all plants and then the isolation, study of expression, and functional characterization of selected members of the family shown to be present in the cacao genome. It is hoped that such investigations will inform genetic approaches to selecting cacao clones with reduced Cd<sup>2+</sup> or using gene-editing methods to modify existing clones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of NRAMP gene family in selected viridiplantae species</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Prediction of homologs</title><p id="Par4">A BlastP search was conducted using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> metal transporters NRAMP1 to 6 protein sequences as queries to identify orthologs in two algae and 28 other plant species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/">http://www.phytozome.net/</ext-link>).

Algae and the moss <italic>S</italic>. <italic>fallax</italic> NRAMPs formed the strongly supported basal cluster A, distinct from the derived major clusters B and C. Cluster B had representatives of NRAMP homologs from all selected viridiplantae species, whereas cluster C was formed by NRAMPs exclusively from vascular plants. The strong support for clusters B and C derived from cluster A suggests that all the land plant NRAMP genes have evolved from same ancestor. Cluster B can be further divided into sub-clusters B1, B2 and B3. The second copy of NRAMP homologs from both algae species formed group B1. Five NRAMP homologs from mosses (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>patens</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>fallax</italic>) and a homolog from spike moss (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>moellendorffii</italic>) were nested in sub-cluster B2. The angiosperm-exclusive B3 sub-cluster, derived from the primitive angiosperm (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>trichopoda</italic>), contained 74 NRAMP homologs, largely from eudicots.

TcNRAMP2 and 3, AtNRAMP2 through 5, and OsNRAMP2 and 6 also grouped in sub-cluster B3. Cluster C comprised NRAMP homologs from vascular plants. The cluster was subdivided into sub-clusters C1 and C2 with strong bootstrap support. AtNRAMP1 and 6 formed a predominantly eudicot cluster C1 with 40 homologs from other plant species including OsNRAMP3 and TcNRAMP6. The angiosperm exclusive sub-cluster C2 contained 43 NRAMPs with nearly equal representation from monocots and eudicots. TcNRAMP1 and 5 clustered here with OsNRAMP1, 4 and 5.

However, the encoded proteins exhibit limited selectivity for divalent metal cations and some NRAMP proteins can also mediate Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport. Cadmium enters into root cells as an opportunistic hitchhiker on poorly specific transporters. The nutrient cations and Cd<sup>2+</sup> are taken up through roots and then transported to other plant organs. This fact implies that the genes encoding transporters involved in uptake of Cd<sup>2+</sup> from soil may be expressed more highly in roots compared to other plant organs. The Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> NRAMP transporters can also mediate Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport.

In view of the significant structural and functional homology of these cacao NRAMPs with the functionally characterized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice Cd<sup>2+</sup> transporters, they may have a similar role in cadmium uptake. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a third study to determine the transcript accumulation of TcNRAMP1, 3 and 5 in response to cadmium stress.

All three genes, as expected, showed high sensitivity to nutrient cation deficiency; however, addition of Cd<sup>2+</sup> drastically reduced the expression of <italic>TcNRAMP1</italic> and <italic>5</italic> to the level detected under control conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Differential expression of these genes in plants grown both with and without Cd<sup>2+</sup> suggests their role in cadmium transport. As previously discussed, Cd<sup>2+</sup> enters the root cell opportunistically through poorly specific transporters. It can be argued that the control system (at present unknown) for <italic>TcNRAMP1</italic> and <italic>5</italic> probably recognized Cd<sup>2+</sup> as a divalent nutrient cation, which resulted in complete reversal of their extremely high expression sensitivity under Cd<sup>2+</sup> supplemented conditions. These results are also supported by reported role of closely similar <italic>AtNRAMP1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and <italic>OsNRAMP5</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> in Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport. Addition of Cd<sup>2+</sup> did not trigger change in expression of <italic>TcNRAMP3</italic>, which suggests a role in the transport of a metal other than Cd<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Expression pattern of a gene may not necessarily be informative with respect to its function. Therefore, we cloned five <italic>TcNRAMP</italic>s and expressed them in yeast strains for functional characterization. Results showed that transporters encoded by <italic>TcNRAMP3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> have broad substrate specificity including Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. TcNRAMP6 is specific for Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In addition to nutrient cations, yeast expressing <italic>NRAMP5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> exhibited high sensitivity to Cd<sup>2+</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a,b</xref>). The yeast cells expressing <italic>TcNRAMP5</italic> accumulated three times more Cd<sup>2+</sup> than the vector only. In contrast, cells expressing <italic>TcNRAMP6</italic> showed the same level of Cd<sup>2+</sup> accumulation as the control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). <italic>TcNRAMP1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> failed to show transport activity for the metals tested. The metal transport activity reported previously for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice NRAMPs supports the present findings for the respective orthologs in cacao. Like TcNRAMP5, OsNRAMP5 and AtNRAMP1 have been implicated in Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, heterologous expression of <italic>AtNRAMP6</italic> in yeast enhanced sensitivity to Cd<sup>2+</sup> without affecting cadmium content in the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, <italic>TcNRAMP3</italic>, an ortholog of <italic>AtNRAMP3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>, showed transport activity for Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> but not for Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Recently, it has been reported that the AtNRAMP2 protein is involved in remobilization of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in Golgi for root growth instead of uptake through roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Based on structural and expression similarities, it is suggested that TcNRAMP2 may be involved in remobilization rather than uptake of metal cation(s).</p><p id="Par29">Structure&#x02013;function relationships in the context of substrate preference in the NRAMP family have been demonstrated in recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The crystal structure of the bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus capitis</italic> NRAMP transporter (ScaNRAMP) revealed a substrate-binding site that coordinates divalent transition-metal ions including Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Four conserved residues including aspartic acid (D)49, asparagine (N)52, alanine (A)223, and methionine (M)226 directly bind the metal substrate. Functional investigations have established that mutation of ion-coordinating residue N52 very strongly reduces its binding affinity for Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Inspection of the substrate-binding site in the sequences used in this study revealed that the metal substrate binding residue N52 located in motif1 was conserved in all sequences apart from TcNRAMP1 where serine replaced asparagine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). TcNRAMP1 and TcNRAMP5 shared 92% similarity in protein sequence and showed similar expression pattern in expression studies; however, TcNRAMP1 failed to show transport activity for the metals tested (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), a finding that may be attributed to the mutation at the conserved residue N52 (based on ScaNRAMP numbering) resulting in complete loss of function. In order to test this hypothesis we developed a synthetic version (TcNRAMP1m) of TcNRAMP1 (S52N). Like TcNRAMP1, functional characterization of the TcNRAMP1m in yeast expression system did not show any transport activity for Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) which implies that the N52 residue in cacao NRAMP1 has no role in binding of the metals tested.</p><p id="Par30">Complete/partial loss of function of the NRAMPs have been associated with mutation of highly conserved residues involved in metal selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and the truncations leading to major structural changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The key metal selectivity role of conserved methionine (M226) is well established in bacteria. A methionine-to-alanine substitution reduced binding affinity and transport of Cd<sup>2+</sup> without affecting binding behaviour of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. However, it enables transport of calcium and magnesium, a finding that suggests that the conserved methionine is essential for transport of low-abundance transition metals in the presence of high-abundance divalent metals such calcium and magnesium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Inspection of the conserved methionine in the sequences we identified here revealed 86% conservation. Among the various protein sequences, OsNRAT1 (NRAMP aluminium transporter 1) and AtNRAMP5 have a methionine-to-alanine substitution, whereas valine has replaced the methionine in OsNRAMP4. Rice OsNRAT1 transports the highly abundant trivalent aluminium metal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, hence the substitution of methionine may have led to the diverged function. However, AtNRAMP5 and OsNRAMP4 have not yet been functionally characterized. Phenylalanine (F398 ScaNRAMP numbering) is also highly conserved in NRAMPs and induced mutation of the residue in AtNRAMP4 has reduced its ability to transport Cd<sup>2+</sup> in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. On other hand, a mutant identified in tobacco encoding a truncated NRAMP5 protein showed no transport activity for Mn<sup>2+</sup> and a weak transport activity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> compared to wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Also, OsNRAMP5 mutants developed using either ion-beam irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> or the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> generated C terminal truncations that showed low uptake of Cd<sup>2+</sup> without compromising yield. We identified a splice variant among the <italic>TcNRAMP5</italic> clones with partial deletion of exons 10 and 12 and complete deletion of exon11. The variant, which encodes a 510 aa peptide, contains the conserved residues that have been implicated as the substrate binding site; however, it lacks transmembrane domain 10 compared to full length TcNRAMP5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). In contrast to TcNRAMP5, the splice variant did not show evidence for any metal transport activity when expressed in yeast (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>); this suggests that a deletion in the C terminal region may cause a complete loss of function despite having the conserved substrate binding site. This result is consistent with previous findings in tobacco<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This finding is also supported by an investigation in yeast that affirms the importance of the entire C-terminal domain in stability and trafficking of membrane protein Pma1 H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results imply a role of <italic>TcNRAMP5</italic> in Cd<sup>2+</sup> uptake in cacao. Identification or induction of loss of function mutations in the gene may help in the development of cacao clones with reduced Cd<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>NRAMP homologs prediction, phylogeny, and gene/protein bioinformatic analyses</title><p id="Par31">A BlastP search was conducted using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> metal transporters NRAMP1 to 6 protein sequences as queries to identify orthologs in two algae and 28 other plant species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/">http://www.phytozome.net/</ext-link>).
