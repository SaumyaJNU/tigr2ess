Identifying genes and mechanisms controlling root angle is therefore of paramount importance to plant breeding. Here we show that the actin-binding protein Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD) controls root growth angle by linking actin filaments and gravity-sensing organelles termed statoliths. <italic>RMD</italic> is upregulated in response to low external phosphate and mutants lacking of RMD have steeper crown root growth angles that are unresponsive to phosphate levels. RMD protein localizes to the surface of statoliths, and <italic>rmd</italic> mutants exhibit faster gravitropic response owing to more rapid statoliths movement. We conclude that adaptive changes to root angle in response to external phosphate availability are RMD dependent, providing a potential target for breeders.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The orientation of plant roots responds to gravity and influences nutrient acquisition.

Quantification of transcript and protein levels revealed that RMD was more abundant under LP (versus HP) conditions in the root (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;e</xref>). In contrast, RMD transcript levels did not change in response to different temperatures, pH values or drought stress conditions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a&#x02013;c</xref>). The <italic>RMD</italic> promoter contains 15 auxin (AuxRE) and 4 phosphate (PHR1-like) response motifs within the 3000-bp region upstream of the start codon. However, we detect no obvious signal difference of the auxin response reporter <italic>DR5::3XVENUS-N7</italic> in WT columella cells under LP versus HP, while phosphate-starvation makers <italic>Phosphate Transporter 2</italic> (<italic>PT2</italic>) and <italic>Phosphate Transporter 6</italic> (<italic>PT6</italic>) were upregulated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8e&#x02013;g</xref>). We therefore reason that upregulated RMD expression in columella cells under LP results from the response to low phosphate (rather than auxin signaling). Moreover, <italic>proRMD::GUS</italic> and <italic>RMD-GFP/rmd-1</italic> reporters are higher in shallow crown roots versus steeper crown roots and primary roots, especially under LP conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;e</xref>). Consistent with RMD up-regulation, the fluorescence intensity of ring-like AFs around columella statoliths is enhanced under LP (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a&#x02013;c</xref>).

Our results revealed that RMD expression level is positively correlated with the formation of shallow crown root angles. Interestingly, variation in RMD levels under high and low phosphate does not affect the growth angle of the primary root, indicating that RMD-mediated responses to soil phosphate are restricted to roots with non-vertical GSAs. This interpretation would be consistent with the idea that root branches and primary roots are fundamentally different in terms of GSA control despite the many apparent similarities in the machinery of gravity perception and gravitropic response between these root classes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">We report that the actin-binding protein RMD controls root growth angle in response to external phosphate. We propose a model for RMD action (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4m</xref>), where under LP, higher RMD levels in columella cells promote stronger interactions between AFs and statoliths that delay their sedimentation, resulting in less robust auxin-driven root gravitropic response and shallower crown root angle. In contrast, lower RMD levels ultimately result in a steeper crown root angle under HP. RMD therefore appears to function to buffer gravitropic signalling in response to external phosphate levels. While the current data show that the adaptive root angle response is RMD dependent, further work would be required to determine the extent to which up-regulation of RMD at the transcript level is responsible for this. Our work provides new mechanistic insights into how plants regulate key components of the gravitropic machinery to adapt their root systems architecture in response to soil nutrient availability and provide new molecular targets for plant breeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par20">The genetic background of rice cultivars were 9522 (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L ssp <italic>Japonica</italic>) and Zhonghua11 (ZH11) (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L ssp <italic>Japonica</italic>) which grow well in the filed in Shanghai.
