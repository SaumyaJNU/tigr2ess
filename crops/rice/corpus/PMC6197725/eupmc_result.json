    "Dyes are most commonly used in textile industries for colouring clothes. After colouring, dri-marine reactive red dye is drained into lakes and rivers, which is very hazardous for aquatic as well as human life. The treatment of this dye solution is necessary to make it clear before it is drained into river. For the treatment of this dye solution one of the cheapest and easy method is adsorption of dye with the natural adsorbents i.e. fuller׳s earth and rice husk. Data presented here focuses to improve the textural characteristics of both the adsorbents through chemical treatment. Selected chemicals for adsorbents treatment are acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate, both chemicals are very cheap, non-hazardous and never used before. Emphasis in this data article is to develop the easy and cost-effective method for removal of dri-marine reactive red dye."
