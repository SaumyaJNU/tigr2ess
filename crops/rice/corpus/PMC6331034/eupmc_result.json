    "The MYB family, one of the largest transcription factor (TF) families in the plant kingdom, plays vital roles in cell formation, morphogenesis and signal transduction, as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the underlying function of bamboo MYB TFs remains unclear. To gain insight into the status of these proteins, a total of 85 PeMYBs, which were further divided into 11 subgroups, were identified in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) by using a genome-wide search strategy. Gene structure analysis showed that PeMYBs were significantly different, with exon numbers varying from 4 to 13. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PeMYBs clustered into 27 clades, of which the function of 18 clades has been predicted. In addition, almost all of the PeMYBs were differently expressed in leaves, panicles, rhizomes and shoots based on RNA-seq data. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that 12 PeMYBs related to the biosynthesis and deposition of the secondary cell wall (SCW) were constitutively expressed, and their transcript abundance levels have changed significantly with increasing height of the bamboo shoots, for which the degree of lignification continuously increased. This result indicated that these PeMYBs might play fundamental roles in SCW thickening and bamboo shoot lignification. The present comprehensive and systematic study on the members of the MYB family provided a reference and solid foundation for further functional analysis of MYB TFs in moso bamboo."
