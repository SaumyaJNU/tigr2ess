Dwarf cultivars are not only improved in lodging resistance and harvest index, but also have better responses to fertilizers (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Khush, 2001</xref>). The introduction of two well-known dwarf genes, <italic>semi-dwarf1</italic> (<italic>sd1</italic>) in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and <italic>reduced height1</italic> (<italic>Rht1</italic>) in wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>), to create semi-dwarf varieties has greatly increased crop yields and initiated the &#x02018;Green Revolution&#x02019; in the 1960s (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hedden, 2003</xref>). Since then, efforts have been made by breeders to collect novel dwarf germplasms and reveal their dwarf mechanisms. More than 70 dwarf mutants have been characterized in rice so far (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/">https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/</ext-link>).</p><p>Dwarfism in plants is mainly caused by deficiency in various endogenous hormones. Gibberellin (GA) is one of the most important phytohormones determining plant height (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Li, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2011</xref>). GAs are a group of diterpenoid compounds that act as regulators in a range of growth and developmental processes in higher plants, including stem elongation, leaf differentiation, photomorphogenesis, pollen development, and flowering (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Richards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Fleet and Sun, 2005</xref>). Dwarf mutants deficient in GA biosynthesis or signaling usually exhibit a <italic>dn</italic>-type dwarf phenotype accompanied by deep green and rough leaves (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Several genes, namely <italic>d18</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Itoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), <italic>d35</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Itoh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), <italic>sd1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Monna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and <italic>eui</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), that contribute to a defective GA biosynthetic pathway have been cloned in rice. In addition, genes encoding the GA receptor GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Ueguchi-Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), DELLA proteins (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Silverstone <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), and the F-box protein GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF2 (GID2) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gomi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) have also been isolated, and an integrated GA signaling pathway has started to emerge (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Sun, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). DELLA protein acts as a GA signaling repressor that restrains the expression of GA-responsive genes in the absence of GA (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Eckardt, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Schwechheimer, 2008</xref>). When GA is present, GID1 binds to GA and subsequently interacts with DELLA proteins in the nucleus, resulting in the recognition of DELLA proteins by the SCF<sup>GID2/SLY1</sup> complex, degradation of DELLA proteins via the 26S proteasome pathway, and consequently activation of the expression of GA-responsive genes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Gubler, 2004</xref>). Despite the fact that numerous dwarf or semi-dwarf mutants have been reported, only <italic>sd1</italic> and its alleles act as useful dwarf sources and thus have been widely used for rice breeding (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Intervarietal hybrid rice yields 10&#x02013;20% more than inbred varieties, and it covers &#x0003e;50% of the total rice-planting area in China (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Two-line intersubspecific (<italic>indica</italic>/<italic>japonica</italic>) hybrids could further increase yield potential, exceeding the yield plateau reached by intervarietal hybrid rice. However, in hybrid breeding programs, both male and female parents must carry the same recessive dwarf gene <italic>sd1</italic> to solve the problem of higher plant stature due to heterosis, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Moreover, the extensive use of limited dwarf sources may cause &#x02018;bottleneck effects&#x02019; in the genetic background when breeding new varieties, which would cause genetic vulnerability to pests or diseases (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Kikuchi and Futsuhara, 1997</xref>). If one parent has a dominant dwarf gene, there will be no restriction on whether or not the other parent has a recessive dwarf gene, which would greatly expand the genetic backgrounds that can be selected for both parents and save time and labor costs in breeding high yield rice hybrids. Thus, the identification of dominant dwarf germplasms is urgent for hybrid rice breeding. However, there have only been a few dominant or semi-dominant dwarf mutants, including <italic>D53</italic>, <italic>Dx</italic>, <italic>D-h</italic>, <italic>LBD4</italic>, <italic>Sdd</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), <italic>Slr1-d</italic>, <italic>Ssil</italic>, and <italic>Tid1</italic>, characterized in rice so far (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Miura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Sunohara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Piao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In addition, these dwarf mutants are not available for practical breeding due to their unfavorable phenotypes, such as severe dwarfism, low fertility, and short grains. In rice, there are currently no dominant dwarfing sources with high breeding value that are being used in practical production.</p><p>Five alleles of <italic>Slr1-d</italic> mutants have been previously reported in rice. They showed ~50&#x02013;70% reduction in plant height when compared with their wild types (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In the present study, we characterized a new mutant allele of <italic>Slr1-d</italic>, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>. The <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> mutant reduces plant height by 37%, which is much milder dwarfism than previously reported alleles. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation site in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is less conserved in the TVHYNP domain of SLR1, which is thought to be the reason for the milder dwarf phenotype in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>. Expression of <italic>SLR1</italic> and five key GA biosynthetic genes is disturbed in the <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> mutant. The S97L substitution in SLR1 leads to a decreased interaction with GID1. In the genetic background of cultivar 9311 with <italic>sd1</italic> eliminated, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> homozygous plants showed suitable plant height and decent seed setting for sterile line production. Moreover, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> heterozygous plants also showed significant yield potential compared with normal 9311 plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The semi-dominant dwarf mutant <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is a spontaneous mutant identified from the <italic>indica</italic> rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) cultivar Zhongxian 3037 (ZX3037).

However, most of these dwarf mutants are accompanied by unfavorable phenotypes such as severe dwarfism, low fertility, and short grains; thus <italic>sd1</italic> and <italic>Rht1</italic> are still the dwarf sources predominantly used to produce modern semi-dwarf varieties in rice and wheat, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hedden, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Both <italic>sd1</italic> and <italic>Rht1</italic> are related to GA. <italic>SD1</italic> encodes the GA biosynthetic enzyme, GA20 oxidase 2, catalyzing late steps of gibberellin biosynthesis, and its mutation reduces the endogenous GA level, causing the semi-dwarf phenotypes in <italic>sd1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Spielmeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>RHT1</italic> encodes a GA signaling repressor DELLA protein; deletion in the N-terminal region constitutively suppresses GA signaling and consequently results in a dominant, semi-dwarf phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Both cases highlight the pivotal role of GA in regulating plant height, making the GA pathway a prime target for generating useful dwarf sources for crop breeding (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hedden, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we isolated and characterized a new allele of rice <italic>Slr1-d</italic> mutants, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>. Similar to the five previously reported alleles of <italic>Slr1-d</italic> mutants, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> had wide, dark-green leaf blades, with reduced response to exogenous GA treatment, and reduced elongation of all internodes. <italic>Slr-d6</italic> is inherited in a semi-dominant dwarf manner. Based on anatomical observations of the culm, we concluded that cell length reduction was the immediate reason for plant height reduction in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>. However, the <italic>Slr1-d1</italic>, <italic>-d2</italic>, <italic>-d3</italic>, <italic>-d4</italic>, and <italic>-d5</italic> mutants had ~50&#x02013;70% reduction in plant height (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), while <italic>Slr-d6</italic> mutant plants only led to a 37% reduction in plant height, which is much milder dwarfism than for previously reported alleles. <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> has a 1 bp substitution resulting in the amino acid substitution S97L in the conserved TVHYNP motif of SLR1. Based on multiple sequence alignment of the conserved DELL1/TVHYNP domain of DELLA protein orthologs, we found that the amino acid of the mutation site in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is less conserved than other alleles, which might be the reason for milder dwarfism in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>.</p><p>DELLA protein is one of the key components of the GA signaling pathway and acts as a suppressor of GA responses. The expression of <italic>SLR1</italic> in the root of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> was up-regulated, which is consistent with the dwarf phenotype. Conversely, the expression of <italic>SLR1</italic> in both the leaf and internode of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> was down-regulated, which is not consistent with the dwarf phenotype. This conflicting result suggests that the dwarf mechanism hidden in <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> could not be explained by its mutated DELLA-encoding gene at the transcriptional level. DELLA protein also plays a role in maintaining GA homeostasis by feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Gubler, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi, 2008</xref>). When a loss-of-function mutation occurs in DELLA protein, the transcript levels of GA20ox and/or GA3ox genes are lower than in the wild type. Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in DELLA protein often result in up-regulation of <italic>GA20ox</italic> and <italic>GA3ox</italic> gene expression. <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is a gain-of-function mutant of rice DELLA protein. The expression of <italic>SD1</italic> in the internode and sheath and <italic>OsGA3ox2</italic> in the root and internode of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> was up-regulated, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, <italic>SD1</italic> in the root and <italic>OsGA3ox2</italic> in the leaf of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> were down-regulated. There are two possible reasons to explain this paradoxical phenomenon: first, the feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis pathway mediated by gain-of-function mutation in DELLA protein has tissue specificity, which mainly happened in the rapidly elongated tissues such as internode and sheath in rice at the jointing&#x02013;booting stage; secondly, the changed expression of one GA biosynthetic gene in one tissue may also have a feedback regulation on its expression in the other tissues to maintain GA homeostasis. Similar to <italic>SD1</italic> and <italic>OsGA3ox2</italic>, the expression of <italic>OsCPS1</italic>, <italic>OsKS1</italic>, and <italic>OsKAO</italic> was mainly up-regulated in internode and/or sheath, and down-regulated in leaf. This is consistent with the current opinion that downstream steps usually regulate feedback on upstream steps in the same biosynthesis pathway. Previous studies have mainly focused on one tissue to illustrate the feedback regulation of DELLA protein on the GA biosynthesis pathway. Whether the feedback regulation of DELLA protein on the GA biosynthesis pathway has tissue specificity still needs to be confirmed.</p><p>DELLA protein may interact with the GA receptor, GID1, in a GA-dependent manner, which guides its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Gubler, 2004</xref>). Based on a yeast two-hybrid assay and a &#x003b2;-gal activity test, we found that the mutated SLR1 protein, Slr1-d6, still interacted with GID1 in a GA-dependent manner, but with decreased interaction ability. Previous studies have also revealed that DELLA proteins interact with GID1 via the N-terminal DELLA/TYHYNP domain of DELLA protein (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Ueguchi-Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Willige <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), especially the valine and proline residues of the TVHYNP motif that directly binds to GID1 (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Murase <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The S97L substitution in Slr1-d6 is adjacent to the important proline residues of the TVHYNP motif; thus we speculate that the 97th serine residue of the TVHYNP motif also plays a role in the interaction between SLR1 and GID1. Taken together, the semi-dominant dwarf phenotypes of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> might be caused by inefficient degradation of the mutated DELLA protein, Slr1-d6.</p><p>Dominant dwarf germplasms possess special advantages in rice hybrid breeding programs. When one parent carries a dominant dwarf gene, it does not matter whether the other parent has a recessive dwarf gene, meaning that a higher number of parental genetic backgrounds can be used, which promotes the use of heterosis. Modern rice varieties are basically semi-dwarf cultivars, intrinsically carrying a recessive dwarf gene. The overwhelming majority of rice dwarf mutants are generated from rice varieties already containing a dwarf gene, which makes it difficult to evaluate the dwarfism effects of new dwarf germplasms accurately for additive effects. Here, we evaluated the dwarfism effects of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> in the genetic background of 9311 with <italic>sd1</italic> eliminated. In the same genetic background of 9311, <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> showed stronger dwarfism ability than <italic>sd1</italic>. The production of F<sub>1</sub> hybrid seeds requires sterile parents that are 10&#x02013;20 cm shorter than the pollen donor parents to increase pollen shedding on the female panicle (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Virmani and Edwards, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Here we provide strong evidence that <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is of great practical application value in rice hybrid breeding. First, the <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> homozygous plants, with heights of ~70 cm, are not much shorter than the main cultivated varieties of rice with plant height of between 80 cm and 120 cm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ricedata.cn/">http://www.ricedata.cn/</ext-link>). Thus, the <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> homozygous plants could be used as the sterile parents, while most rice cultivars could be used as the pollen donor parents. Secondly, the seed-setting rate of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> homozygous plants is ~80%, which is sufficient for production of F<sub>1</sub> hybrid seeds. Moreover, the yield per plant of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> heterozygous plants increased by 25% when compared with the normal 9311. Theoretically, if <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> is used in the sterile parents as a dominant dwarf source, the genetic backgrounds of the pollen donor parents will not be restricted, and the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid plants will gain the standard <italic>sd1</italic> semi-dwarf plant height and have a higher yield potential for carrying the heterozygous genotype of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic>. The <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> heterozygous plants that have been selected for yield testing had less competition pressure for space from their neighbors in the segregation population, which would contribute to their yield just like a marginal effect. However, the exact yield-increasing potential of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> in heterosis utilization still needs to be fully evaluated with more cross-combinations.</p><p>In rice, mutants of SLR1 located in DELLA/TYHYNP and SAW subdomains may lead to dominant dwarf phenotypes (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Asano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In addition, overexpression of <italic>SLR1</italic> variants that are mutated in LHRI, VHIID, LHRII, and PFYRE subdomains could also generate dwarfing transgenic seedlings (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These studies indicate that mutation of SLR1 in multiple subdomains could lead to the generation of dominant dwarf mutants, making <italic>SLR1</italic> the prime target gene for generating dominant dwarf sources. In light of great yield-increasing potential of <italic>Slr1-d6</italic> and gene-editing techniques developed in rice (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Shan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), we propose that the rice DELLA protein-encoding gene, <italic>SLR1</italic>, is a potential target for gene editing in rice molecular breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s20"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
