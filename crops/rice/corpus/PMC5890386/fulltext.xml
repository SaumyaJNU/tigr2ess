In South and South East Asia, about 40% of rice production is from deltaic regions that are vulnerable to salt stress. A quantitative approach was developed for characterizing genotypic variability in biomass production, leaf transpiration rate and leaf net photosynthesis responses to salinity during the vegetative stage, with the aim of developing efficient screening protocols to accelerate breeding varieties adapted to salt-affected areas. Three varieties were evaluated in pots under greenhouse conditions and in the field, with average soil salinity ranging from 2 to 12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Plant biomass, net photosynthesis rate, leaf transpiration rate and leaf conductance were measured at regular intervals. Crop responses were fitted using a logistic function with three parameters: 1) maximum rate under control conditions (Y<sub>max</sub>), 2) salinity level for 50% of reduction (b), and 3) rate of reduction (<italic>a)</italic>. Variation in the three parameters correlated significantly with variation in plant biomass production under increasing salinity. Salt stress levels that caused 50% reduction in net leaf photosynthesis and transpiration rates were higher in the tolerant genotype BRRI Dhan47 (16.5&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 14.3&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively) than the sensitive genotype IR29 (11.1&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 6.8&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). In BRRI Dhan47, the threshold beyond which growth was significantly reduced was above 5&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the rate of growth reduction beyond this threshold was as low as 4% per unit increase in salinity. This quantitative approach to screening for salinity tolerance in rice offers a means to better understand rice growth under salt stress and, using simulation modelling, can provide an improved tool for varietal characterization.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Leaf photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Modelling</kwd><kwd>Rice</kwd><kwd>Salt-stress</kwd><kwd>Water-stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0020">Salinity is one of the main limiting environmental factors for crop production worldwide. Its occurrence and severity are expected to increase by around 25% by 2050 in vulnerable regions, particularly in deltaic costal zones (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Dasgupta et al., 2014</xref>) where rice growing areas account for more than 65% of global production, making salinity one of the major threats to food security. Rice has been classified as salt-sensitive (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Maas and Hoffman, 1977</xref>). Salinity has different effects on yield and growth, depending on crop stage, stress severity and duration, as well as the tolerance of the variety (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lutts et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Zeng and Shannon, 2000</xref>). Rice yield has been estimated to decrease by 50% at a salinity level of 6.9&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Grattan et al., 2002</xref>). Addressing salt stress by developing improved salt-tolerant rice cultivars could mitigate the effects of salinity on rice production and contribute to improving food security at a global scale.</p><p id="par0025">Salinity tolerance in rice results from complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Numerous studies have been conducted to understand salt stress tolerance mechanisms such as minimizing sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) uptake and excluding Na<sup>+</sup> from the shoot (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Platten et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Ismail and Horie, 2017</xref>). Candidate genes have been identified that confer salinity tolerance through regulating ion transport, osmoprotection and growth acceleration (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Horie et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Ismail and Horie, 2017</xref>). This understanding has contributed significantly to the successful breeding of salt-tolerant varieties and for identifying suitable donors for breeding programs (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2008</xref>). However, quantifying the contribution of these mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level in relation to their functions at the whole plant scale and under field conditions still remains unresolved.</p><p id="par0030"><xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Maas and Hoffman (1977)</xref> described plant responses to salinity using a simple quadratic equation, which defines the rate of yield decrease per unit of salinity increase, and the critical level of salinity at which a significant decrease in yield was observed. Thus far, these parameters have not been correlated with physiological processes occurring in the plant. Considering that yield results from the combination of numerous complex processes, the use of this equation may not be suitable for screening for salinity tolerance traits. Understanding salinity response processes at different scales within the plant could play an important role in accelerating progress for developing salt-tolerant high yielding rice varieties (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Horie et al., 2012</xref>). Ion and nutrient imbalances, adjustment of water status, stomatal conductance, and reduction in photosynthetic activity are among the physiological responses occurring at the plant level (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Horie et al., 2012</xref>). These responses have been reported to follow a two-step process with an initial water deficit effect over a short term and an ion toxicity effect over a longer term (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Munns et al., 1995</xref>). Specific responses to salt stress involve mechanisms limiting salt entry and excluding salt at the whole plant and/or cellular level, especially from active tissues such as young leaves and reproductive parts. This mechanism preserves the photosynthetic apparatus and other physiological processes necessary for plant survival and growth. Salinity also has a direct effect on cell expansion and division, as typically reflected by a reduction in leaf area (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 1984</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Netondo et al., 2004</xref>). Genotypic variability in the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> accumulating in plant tissue under salt stress was reported to be associated with variation in photosynthesis (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Moradi and Ismail, 2007</xref>). This can even be observed at salinity levels lower than 2&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, at which symptoms of the effects of salinity are not yet visible (<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Yeo, 1998</xref>).</p><p id="par0035">In addition to variations in salt exclusion and salt partitioning to roots and old tissues, variability in responses of photosynthetic traits to salinity is also important &#x02212; largely the result of variability in tissue tolerance of accumulated salts. Tolerance to salinity during the vegetative and reproductive stages of rice involves numerous different mechanisms that contribute to the whole plant growth and productivity (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Flowers, 2010</xref>). Exposure of rice to salinity around the time of panicle initiation and flowering affects the growth and development of panicles and spikelets causing spikelet sterility, thus limiting sink size and grain formation. Senescence of expanded leaves is also accelerated by salinity, partially reducing assimilation due to the reduction of the photosynthetically active leaf area and further reducing assimilates allocated to grains. These processes result in changing source-sink relationships within the crop, leading to a reduction in grain yield.</p><p id="par0040">Quantifying the variability of these physiological mechanisms using mathematical equations provides a means to describe and disaggregate the contribution of different limiting factors, particularly the genotypic component of the variability in crop responses. This approach could be used to develop trait-based modelling &#x02212; a framework to test hypotheses about crop performance and to integrate the complex unpredictable variability of soil salinity in the field, as one of the main limitations in developing adapted varieties and technologies to overcome the effects of salinity (<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Skaggs et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Crescimanno and Garofalo, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Soltani and Sinclair, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="par0045">In this study, a mathematical equation was developed to quantify effects of salinity on rice crops during the vegetative stage. Three genotypes with contrasting salinity tolerance were evaluated in both greenhouse and field experiments. Plant growth and leaf gas exchange, in response to four different levels of salinity treatment during the vegetative stage, were assessed. The patterns of these responses were used to develop an equation incorporating traits and varietal differences related to salt stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="par0050">Rice response to salinity treatment during vegetative stage was characterized over a series of four experiments (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

A field experiment was used to evaluate responses at the plant population (crop) level and to validate genotypic variability and salinity effects observed in the greenhouse experiments. The greenhouse experiments were conducted at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Los Ba&#x000f1;os, Philippines (14.17 N, 121.26 E), using three rice genotypes (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); IR29, IR64 and BRRI Dhan47, characterized as sensitive, intermediate and tolerant of salt stress, respectively (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2008</xref>).

The three experiments were arranged in randomized block design with salinity treatment as main factor and genotypes as the subplot factor. The pots were submerged in tanks filled with a nutrient solution. Each tank contained 96 pots arranged to maintain 20&#x000a0;cm spacing between plants. Four tanks corresponding to the four salinity treatments were used in Experiments 1 and 2. Two tanks were used (control and Treatment 2) in Experiment 3. Each genotype was represented by 32 pots in each tank with one plant per pot, with pots rotated weekly when the nutrient solution was renewed. The pH of the nutrient solution in each tank was adjusted daily to 5.5, and salinity was recorded hourly using a 5TE sensor connected to an EM50 datalogger (Decagon Devices, Inc. USA, Supplementary Fig. 1) at 10&#x000a0;cm depth. Plants were grown in a nutrient solution from sowing until the start of the salinity treatment, then exposed to their respective salinity treatments from 21 to 50 d after sowing (DAS) in Treatments 1 and 2. For Treatment 3 (12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the treatment was terminated at 35 DAS (when most of the fully expanded leaves of the sensitive genotype, IR29, senesced) to permit recovery before flowering, after which plants were maintained using the control treatment solution.

At the end of the stress period, plant biomass was reduced to between 0.36 and 0.61 in Treatment 2 (8&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) relative to the control. This result is consistent with the reported rice crop responses at this level of salinity. For instance, grain yield was reported to decrease to 0.5 at a mean seasonal soil salinity of 6.77&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Grattan et al., 2002</xref>).

The genotype BRRI Dhan47 consistently responded as a salt-tolerant genotype, with its biomass reduced by only 25% at the end of the stress and by 50% at flowering. It is likely that under higher salinity conditions (&#x02265;12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the severe osmotic stress limiting plant growth and function was equivalent to an apparent water stress of 516&#x000a0;kPa in Experiments 1 &#x00026; 2 (Supplementary Table 1) with Treatment 3 suggesting that at higher levels the two component effects of salinity (osmotic stress and ion toxicity) were over-shadowed by the severe stress conditions due to limited water uptake. Previous studies have reported similar ranges for decrease in rice growth under similar water deficits (<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Wopereis et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Castillo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="par0195">Significant interaction between genotype and salinity treatment was observed. This interaction was observed for the plants under mild salinity stress treatment (4&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). No significant difference in plant growth was observed between BRRI Dhan 47 and IR64 under stress compared to the control, but a significant increase in plant biomass and leaf area index was observed in IR29 under stress. Rice was reported to be unaffected by salt stress at this lower salinity after the 5- leaf stage (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>). As the salt stress in the current experiment was initiated at 21 DAS, the seedlings were already beyond the critically sensitive stage and were expected to tolerate mild stress (below 4&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). An increase in plant growth was even observed for both IR29 and BRRI Dhan47, suggesting stimulation of growth. This increase in growth under mild salinity has been attributed to an increase in root uptake of nutrients, mainly driven by the difference in osmotic potential between the plant and the soil solution (<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Marcelis and van Hooijdonk, 1999</xref>). Passive uptake of soil nutrients was reported at a xylem osmotic potential of 200&#x000a0;kPa. The osmotic potential of a soil solution at 4&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is lower than that level (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Horie et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Schr&#x000f6;der et al., 2014</xref>). Defining this critical level of water salinity is important for management of rice field irrigation with brackish water, particularly in determining amount and timing of saline water to be mixed with fresh water when the latter is scarce.</p><p id="par0200">Based on the variability in plant growth responses to increasing salinity from one level to another, the rice plant biomass decrease was fitted using a three-step linear regression (Supplementary Fig. 3). A first linear phase characterized by a plateau takes place before the critical level of salinity (significant decrease point) occurs. A second phase then follows where the plant responds to the osmotic stress of the saline soil solution and results in a slowdown in its function and is likely limiting uptake of toxic ions such as Na<sup>+</sup>. A third phase occurs when a critical amount of sodium has been accumulated. In this condition, the plant&#x02019;s system is affected by ion toxicity resulting in an irreversible destruction of functional cells and tissues. This new description is consistent with the two-phase response of wheat plants to salinity described by <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Munns et al. (1995)</xref>. Based on the extent of tolerance of a genotype, the first phase was broken down into two phases allowing the determination of the level of tolerance within and between species. This further integrates the dimension of the duration of exposure to the stress while expressing the response based on accumulated Na<sup>+</sup>. No genotypic differences in plant growth were observed at the highest salinity level (12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Treatment 3), suggesting that water uptake was the dominant factor in that treatment. Even the tolerant genotype was overwhelmed due to both osmotic stress and higher accumulation of salt in plant tissues resulting in dual effects of toxicity and internal dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="sec0095"><label>4.2</label><title>Modelling leaf gas exchange responses to salinity</title><p id="par0205">The trends of leaf gas exchange response to salinity have been fitted with both a two piecewise linear function and a logistic function determined by three parameters. The two piecewise linear function achieved a higher coefficient of determination than the logistic function as it captured specific responses of the crop growth related to the current experimental conditions. The shape of the two piece-wise functions was not consistent among genotypes or among variables. The individually linear parameters were not comparable among genotypes and indicated a more environmental (experiment and time of measurement) factor dependence. For instance in Experiment 2, salinity had less effect with the dilution effect of high biomass production, mitigating the stress impact. Plants showed higher biomass production and thus higher transpiration and photosynthesis as they were growing in the dry season with higher radiation. In contrast, plants in Experiment 1 showed lower biomass production, lower transpiration and leaf net photosynthesis, resulting in less dilution of accumulated salt, thus causing early trigger of responses to salinity. It is likely that the two piecewise linear function captured the plasticity of responses to salinity in these rice genotypes due to stimulation and slowing of processes, as indicated by the variability of the linear coefficients (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The replicability of the function is then limited, as was observed for the leaf conductance where one linear regression would result in a better fit than a two piecewise linear function (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c).</p><p id="par0210">In addition, the RMSE<sub>n</sub> of the two piecewise linear function was higher compared to the RMSE<sub>n</sub> of the logistic function, based on the observed data from the field experiment (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), suggesting that the sigmoid function presented lower error and thus better fit than the two piecewise linear function.</p><p id="par0215">The trends of the genotypic responses were similar and consistent with their level of tolerance when a logistic function was used. A sensitive cultivar was defined as having the lowest threshold value of salinity that reduced the leaf gas exchange variables to 50% of their value under the control treatment and having the highest reduction rate value. In contrast, a tolerant cultivar like BRRI Dhan 47 had the highest value of (<italic>b)</italic> and the lowest value of <italic>(a)</italic>. These parameters are therefore useful indicators for salinity tolerance and can be of interest for phenotyping, as they are measurable and indicative of genotypic variability.</p><p id="par0220">It is worth noting that the severity of salinity impact on the rice crop is greater in drier environments (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Asch and Wopereis, 2001</xref>). Thus, the salinity levels we defined as thresholds to cause a significant effect on plant functions are limited to the environmental conditions of the experiments, assuming that toxic salt accumulation is driven by transpiration. Future validation of these values under drier environments is desirable to confirm the tolerance level of the genotypes. However, relative genotypic difference may remain similar under low humidity since the tolerant genotype, BRRI Dhan47, can adjust its transpiration rate at a lower salinity levels than IR29 and IR64, both of which maintained their transpiration up to a salinity level of 8&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Since BRRI Dhan 47 has been reported to tolerate salinity stress above 12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2008</xref>), a study on the performance of BRRI Dhan47 under drought stress could confirm if the delayed responses of its transpiration at higher salinity levels are mainly driven by osmotic stress or by salt exclusion ability. Studies of tissue tolerance would also confirm if the ability of BRRI Dhan 47 to maintain photosynthesis is due to higher ion toxicity tolerance involving compartmentation within cells or tissues as reported for other tolerant rice genotypes (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Flowers et al., 1985</xref>, <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Yeo et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p id="par0225">The parameters defined for leaf gas exchange responses correlated with plant growth responses to salinity and could be of interest to identify traits that are critical for tolerance. Integrating the logistic equations into crop models could link the process responses directly to crop yield assessment, in which the parameter <italic>(b)</italic> will quantify the tolerance of the genotype and the parameter <italic>(a)</italic> its resilience. The logistic function further allows representation of growth maintenance or decrease with temporal variability of soil salinity compared with the usual seasonal salinity effect representation in most crop models. Early reports in modelling rice crop responses to salinity in the indica subgroup have reported a threshold of salt stress for plant biomass and yield reduction at 3&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with a decrease of 13% per unit increase in salinity beyond this threshold (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Maas and Hoffman, 1977</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 1999</xref>). This critical value reflects variability among genotypes when complex plant processes contributing to yield, such as photosynthesis and its interactions with limiting environmental factors, such as salinity, were considered. With the recently released salt-tolerant varieties, such as BRRI Dhan47, this threshold has increased to more than 4 or 5&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the rate of decrease in <italic>(a)</italic> declined to as low as 4% per unit of salinity increase beyond the threshold. The impact of this change in threshold on yield would be interesting to quantify. Variation in salinity tolerance in rice and crop responses to salinity during the reproductive stage have also been reported as independent of the mechanisms involved in tolerance during vegetative stage (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Moradi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Ahmadizadeh et al., 2016</xref>). Similar investigations would, therefore, be of interest for the entire crop growth duration to better capture the contribution and impact of tolerance on the crop yield variability in saline fields. The capacity of the genotype to recover after the salinity treatment also suggests the need for a complex approach in quantifying the salinity effect. For instance, the production of new tillers after the stress may result in yield loss reduction if these tillers were productive. Additional work is on-going to explore the integration of these findings into the rice crop model ORYZA (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouman et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>) to assess the effects of the observed variability at the whole plant level for genotypes with different tolerance thresholds. This offers a mechanistic description of the genotypic variability of rice crop responses to salinity, while limiting the number of parameters for the model. This type of quantification can also be performed for additional new varieties using crop modelling (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Karlberg et al., 2006</xref>), to estimate expected gains and to determine the geographical regions where these varieties will likely be more successful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0100"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0230">Several salt-tolerant rice varieties were recently released with the potential to increase and sustain rice productivity in salt-affected areas. This study developed approaches to characterize and quantify tolerance in these varieties. At a high salinity level of 12&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, no significant differences in biomass were observed among the contrasting rice genotypes evaluated in this study, indicating that even the tolerant genotype was overwhelmed due to both osmotic stress and higher accumulation of salt in plant tissues, causing both toxicity and internal dehydration. The responses of leaf gas exchange variables were fitted using both piecewise linear and logistic functions. The logistic equation allowed better comparison among genotypes and provided a simplistic quantification approach for their tolerance, providing parameters that quantified both tolerance and resilience of a genotype. For the tolerant genotype BRRI Dhan47, a 50% loss in leaf conductance did not occur until a salinity level of 11.08&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, but BRRI Dhan47adjusted its stomatal conductance at a lower level than the other genotypes (1.04&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Although the transpiration and net photosynthesis rates of BRRI Dhan47 decreased to 50% only at salinity levels of 14.30 and 16.15&#x000a0;dS&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, the slope of this reduction was statistically similar to that of IR64 and IR29, thereby suggesting a window for further improvement in this trait to future enhance salinity tolerance. For future studies, we propose an integration of these equations into crop modelling to evaluate the impact of the observed variability on rice yield. This might further contribute to improving modelling of rice production in salt-affected areas for both agronomic research and for virtual multi-location evaluation of breeding lines. Further investigations of these parameters using larger numbers of contrasting genotypes and genetic populations would be important, and could also facilitate further understanding of the traits associated with salinity tolerance and their genetic control during the vegetative stage. For whole-season crop responses, similar studies would be needed to understand and quantify genotypic variability in salinity tolerance during the reproductive stage. Since different important mechanisms are involved during these two phases, quantifying the salinity effect on kernel formation from initiation through pollination and grain filling would be necessary to define variability in grain size and number, and effects on the source capacity caused by leaf senescence, and biomass partitioning. Linking this quantification approach with crop modelling, trait-based selection and genome-wide association would provide innovatively integrated approaches for rice breeding.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmadizadeh</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vispo</surname><given-names>N.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Calapit-Palao</surname><given-names>C.D.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pangaan</surname><given-names>I.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vi&#x000f1;a</surname><given-names>C.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>R.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reproductive stage salinity tolerance in rice: a complex trait to phenotype</article-title><source>Indian J.
