NHEJ often leads to a small insertion/deletion and is widely used in generating loss-of-function mutants. HDR utilizes a DNA donor repair template (DRT) that is flanked with sequences homologous to those adjacent to the DSBs to guide the DNA repair (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Puchta, 1998</xref>). HDR can be used for targeted allele replacement or introduction of markers to target loci, providing a valuable tool for crop improvement. In principle, three potential mechanisms have been proposed for HDR of DSBs: single-strand annealing (SSA), synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and the so-called double strand break repair (DSBR) model (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Puchta, 1998</xref>). During SSA, both ends of the DSB carry complementary sequences. These molecules can then anneal to one another to form a chimeric DNA molecule with the 3' overhangs. Consequently, the sequences between the complementary sequences will be lost. Therefore, SSA is also classified as a non-conservative HDR-mediated DSB repair mechanism (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Puchta and Fauser, 2013</xref>). In the cases of DSBR and SDSA, the homologous repair template can be supplied in <italic>cis</italic> or in <italic>trans</italic>. Following the DSB induction, 3' end invasion of a single strand into a homologous double strand occurs, resulting in a D-loop. Reparative synthesis is initiated using the newly paired strand as a template. In DSBR, DNA synthesis occurs at both broken ends so that genetic information is copied from both strands of the homologous sequences, which may lead to a crossover event (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Puchta and Fauser, 2013</xref>). DSBR is a prominent mechanism for meiotic recombination (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Osman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In SDSA, the DSB is at first resected and processed to generate 3' overhangs on both sides of the DSB. The 3' overhangs are then paired with the homologous arms of the DRT and are extended by DNA synthesis using the DRT as a template. Then, the newly synthesized strands withdraw from the DRT and anneal back to the locus (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Puchta and Fauser, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Paix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). SDSA has been proposed as a repair mechanism when the single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotides (ssODNs) are used as the DRT (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Paquet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Richardson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Kan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). When dsDNAs are used as repair templates, different DSBs generated by Cas9 variants engage in different repair pathways and the polarity of the overhang structure is a critical determinant of DSB repair pathway choice in human cells (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bothmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, analyses of the sequence requirements for efficient repair of DSBs generated by Cas9 in human cells indicated that the repair process is more consistent with SDSA when either ssODNs or dsDNAs are used as repair templates (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Paix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Thus, the mechanism underlying HDR of DSBs when a dsDNA is used as the DRT still remains inconclusive, especially in plants.</p><p>Genome editing technologies enable precise modifications of DNA sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> and offer great promise for crop improvement. CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated Cas9) has revolutionized genome editing because of its simplicity and versatility (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Miao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Shan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; J. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). CRISPR/Cpf1 (CRISPR from <italic>Prevoltella</italic> and <italic>Francisella</italic> 1), a new class 2 CRISPR/Cas system, was recently exploited as an alternative to the widely used SpCas9 in genome editing in many organisms including plants (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fonfara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Gao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; S. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Cpf1 utilizes a thymidine-rich protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site &#x02018;TTTN&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) or non-canonical &#x02018;TYCV&#x02019; (S. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), and is guided by a single CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The Cpf1 crRNA (~43 nt) is shorter than that of SpCas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) by 60 nucleotides and no <italic>trans</italic>-acting crRNA is needed (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Fonfara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Moreover, Cpf1 produces long 5'-protruding ends, which may facilitate the pairing and insertion of repair templates (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Thus, the CRISPR/Cpf1 system is emerging as an attractive tool for editing AT-rich regions (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Begemann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; S. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Herein, we coupled a plant codon-optimized LbCpf1 from <italic>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic> ND 2006 (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) with a simple ribozyme crRNA array driven by the <italic>OsU3</italic> promoter (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Gao and Zhao, 2014</xref>). We demonstrated that DRTs with either only the left homologous arm or two homologous arms function efficiently in achieving precise targeted replacement of the <italic>Acetolactate synthase</italic> (<italic>ALS</italic>) gene, which encodes a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and is a major target for ALS-inhibiting herbicides such as chlorsulfuron and bispyribac sodium (BS) in rice (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Mazur <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). Our findings support the hypothesis that SDSA is involved in HDR of DSBs generated by Cpf1-crRNA in plant cells when the dsDNA is used as a DRT. Our observation that the left homologous arm alone is sufficient for HDR not only offers a better understanding of the mechanism underlying HDR in plants, but also greatly simplifies the design of DRTs for targeted allele replacement in crop plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Construction of the CRISPR/LbCpf1-related vectors</title><p>The vectors used in this study were based on the vector pCXUN-LbCpf1 that replaced the ubiquitin-Cas9 in plasmid pCXUN-Cas9 (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) with ubiquitin-LbCpf1 in plasmid LbCpf1-OsU6 (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).

The calli that survived one round of selection pressure of hygromycin were subsequently transferred onto induction medium and regeneration medium with 0.4 &#x000b5;M BS. Then, the regenerated plants were used for PCR-RE.

The achievement of precise gene replacement events using only left armed-DRT not only further our understanding of the potential mechanism underlying HDR of DSBs, but also greatly simplifies the design of DRTs for precision genome editing in crop improvement. However, we observed a relatively lower efficiency of CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated <italic>ALS</italic> gene replacement in this study, compared with that of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene replacement in our previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; J. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). The difference in efficiency probably results from the fact that the editing activity of Cpf1 is not as high as that of Cas9 as reported by others and our previous study (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; S. <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Despite the lower efficiency, CRISPR/LbCpf1-mediated gene replacement targets sequences that cannot be edited by Cas9 due to the differences in PAM requirement (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Jinek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Cong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). LbCpf1 utilizes a thymidine-rich PAM &#x02018;TTTV&#x02019; (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), which enables targeting AT-rich regions of a genome such as 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and the promoter of a gene of interest. It is usually more difficult to find suitable target sequences in the above-mentioned regions for SpCas9, which has a PAM requirement of NGG. Therefore, CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated gene editing is particularly useful for precisely knocking-in a gene of interest or replacing a gene/promotor at a targeted specific locus, or inserting a small DNA fragment that encodes an epitope tag or fluorescence protein at the 5' or 3' end of a gene.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>HDR of Cpf1-induced DSBs in rice is consistent with the proposed SDSA model</title><p>When a dsDNA DRT is used as the repair template, the Cas9-(D10A) induced 5' overhang DNA structure and DRTs with an asymmetric left homology arm are particularly amenable to gene conversion/replacement (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bothmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Cpf1 cleavage produces 5'-protruding sticky ends, which may facilitate the pairing and insertion of the DRT through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In this study, we added two crRNA targets at each end of the DRTs. We achieved either precise gene replacement or partial HDR events both in transient assays and in stable edited rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, we did not detect any events harbouring the integration of the entire DRT with the target sequences at each end, indicating that the DSBs are indeed resected through exo- and/or endonucleolytic processing of the 5' end to yield the 3' overhangs on both sides of the DSBs (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bothmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Paix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The invasion of 3' end single strands may lead to the formation of a Holliday junction (HJ) and paired with the homologous arms of the DRT, and then extended by DNA synthesis, thus resulting in conservative precise gene replacement (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Puchta, 1998</xref>). Our observations of the successful achievement of HDR events when a DRT with only the left homologous arm was used as repair template are consistent with a replicative repair process that requires pairing between a 3'-homology arm on the donor and homologous sequences in the genome on at least one side of the DSBs, as demonstrated recently in human cells (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Paix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Besides, we also observed the template switching between DRT and wild-type sequences as shown in some partial HDR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), indicating the occurrence of template switching due to unstable replication forks during multiple rounds of dissociation and re-invasion (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This phenomenon, again, is similar to the recently reported precision gene editing using Cas9 endonuclease in human cells (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Paix <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we here demonstrate synthesis-dependent repair of Cpf1-induced DSBs, which enables us to replace the wild-type <italic>ALS</italic> gene precisely with the intended mutant version that carries two discrete point mutations conferring herbicide resistance to rice plants. Our finding that donor with only the left homology arm is sufficient to achieve targeted gene replacement enables us to gain a better mechanistic understanding of HDR of DSBs for targeted gene replacement in various organisms and simplifies the design of DRTs to improve agriculturally important traits in crops through CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated genome editing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
