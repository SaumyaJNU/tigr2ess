    "Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) rice is one of the most important crops of Thailand. It is a challenging task to identify the genes responding to salinity in KDML105 rice. The analysis of the gene co-expression network has been widely performed to prioritize significant genes, in order to select the key genes in a specific condition. In this work, we analyzed the two-state co-expression networks of KDML105 rice under salt-stress and normal grown conditions. The clustering coefficient was applied to both networks and exhibited significantly different structures between the salt-stress state network and the original (normal-grown) network. With higher clustering coefficients, the genes that responded to the salt stress formed a dense cluster. To prioritize and select the genes responding to the salinity, we investigated genes with small partners under normal conditions that were highly expressed and were co-working with many more partners under salt-stress conditions. The results showed that the genes responding to the abiotic stimulus and relating to the generation of the precursor metabolites and energy were the great candidates, as salt tolerant marker genes. In conclusion, in the case of the complexity of the environmental conditions, gaining more information in order to deal with the co-expression network provides better candidates for further analysis."
