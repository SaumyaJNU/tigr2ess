The resulting adaptation trait may reverse, or become fixed in the population leading to evolution of species. Deciphering the molecular basis of adaptive traits can thus give evolutionary clues. In phytophagous insects, a change in host-plant range can lead to emergence of new species. Among them, <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> is a major agricultural lepidopteran pest consisting of two host-plant strains having diverged 3 MA, based on mitochondrial markers. In this paper, we address the role of microRNAs, important gene expression regulators, in response to host-plant change and in adaptive evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Using small RNA sequencing, we characterized miRNA repertoires of the corn (C) and rice (R) strains of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic>, expressed during larval development on two different host-plants, corn and rice, in the frame of reciprocal transplant experiments. We provide evidence for 76 and 68 known miRNAs in C and R strains and 139 and 171 novel miRNAs. Based on read counts analysis, 34 of the microRNAs were differentially expressed in the C strain larvae fed on rice as compared to the C strain larvae fed on corn. Twenty one were differentially expressed on rice compared to corn in R strain. Nine were differentially expressed in the R strain compared to C strain when reared on corn. A similar ratio of microRNAs was differentially expressed between strains on rice. We could validate experimentally by QPCR, variation in expression of the most differentially expressed candidates. We used bioinformatics methods to determine the target mRNAs of known microRNAs. Comparison with the mRNA expression profile during similar reciprocal transplant experiment revealed potential mRNA targets of these host-plant regulated miRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">In the current study, we performed the first systematic analysis of miRNAs in Lepidopteran pests feeding on host-plants. We identified a set of the differentially expressed miRNAs that respond to the plant diet, or differ constitutively between the two host plant strains. Among the latter, the ones that are also deregulated in response to host-plant are molecular candidates underlying a complex adaptive trait.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5119-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>Regulation of gene expression</kwd><kwd>Insect plant interaction</kwd><kwd>microRNAs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-BSV7-0004-01</award-id><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parrinello</surname><given-names>Hugues</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Successful adaptation to the host-plant is of fundamental importance to herbivorous insects. It requires that the adult female accepts the host-plant for oviposition and that the host allows feeding and proper development of larvae. Understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms used by insects in response to their host-plants ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] for review) recently progressed thanks to availability of new reference genomes and transcriptomes of major polyphagous herbivorous insect pests. Genomic sequences analyses highlighted expansion of chemosensory and/or detoxification genes in generalist herbivores compared to specialist ones reflecting their larger diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. RNA-seq analyses revealed that generalist herbivores use transcriptional plasticity of various categories of genes in response to their diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]: detoxification, digestion, cuticular and ribosomal genes. Transcriptional plasticity of specific sets of genes has also been shown in an oliphagous lepidopteran species, <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, when it is reared on host -or acceptable non-host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These data show that a change of host-plant in herbivorous insect requires large scale transcriptional changes involving combinations of various gene family members.</p><p id="Par5">While the nature and role of protein coding genes involved in adaptation to the host-plant begin to emerge, the putative role of non-coding genes has yet to be explored. Among them, microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non coding RNAs (sncRNAs) of approximately 22&#x000a0;nt in length, which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are known to help fine-tune complex genetic networks ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], for review). The mode of action of miRNAs results in relatively weak modulation of less than twofold both at the RNA and protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Two other classes of small non coding RNAs combat the invasion and the expansion of transposable elements (TE), the short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway suppresses TEs in all tissues of plant and animals, whereas the Piwi-interacting RNA pathway (piRNA) seems more specific to the gonads of metazoans (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for review).</p><p id="Par6">Since miRNAs have been shown to be involved in many physiological or cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we hypothesized that they may play a role in adaptation of a phytophagous insect to its host-plants and that they may show different expression patterns in different host-plant races of the insect. To test this hypothesis, we used the noctuid moth <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, which consists of two host-plant strains, one mostly associated to corn (C strain or SfC), the other to rice (R strain or SfR), and whose genomes are recently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We performed reciprocal transplant (RT) experiments of the two strains on the two host-plants and isolated and sequenced sncRNAs from feeding larvae. We present the differential expression patterns of miRNAs and their putative coding genes targets involved i) in phenotypic plasticity (the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to variation in the environment) of each strain in response to corn or rice ii) in adaptive evolution or genetic drift, by additional comparison of the two strains on the same host-plant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Deep sequencing of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> small RNA</title><p id="Par7">To characterize <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> miRNA, small RNA libraries were constructed from whole body of corn-fed and rice-fed larvae of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> C and R strains. Two independent libraries (biological replicates) were prepared and independently sequenced using Illumina technology. Between 31.5 to 57 millions high quality sequence reads were obtained after adapter trimming in each library (See Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Their size distribution shows an over-abundance of sequences at 22&#x000a0;nt, typical of miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a-b</xref>). On average, we detected 11.12+/&#x02212;&#x02009;3.67% of sequences of size 22&#x000a0;nt on corn and 5.49+/&#x02212;&#x02009;1.06% on rice. We detected a second peak between 25 and 33&#x000a0;nt that could correspond to expression of piRNAs. After collapsing the reads, we identified between 2 to 5 million unique sequences, 4% of which (4.2+/&#x02212;&#x02009;0.2% on corn and 3.71+/&#x02212;&#x02009;0.52% on rice) on average corresponding to miRNAs of 22&#x000a0;nt (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). However, in term of diversity, piRNAs seem more abundant than miRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>) which may reflect abundance and diversity of transposable elements (TE) in the genome of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (29.14% and 29.10% of genome coverage by TE in C and R strain, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Size profiling of small non coding RNAs and their homology to different RNA classes or to Transposable Elements (TE).

The small ncRNA sequences of SfC or SfR were aligned against these different references, in addition to the sequences of TE copies, which should highlight putative piRNAs or endo-siRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>), The most abundant hits (29&#x02013;29.1%) were found matching to Sf miRNAs precursors (precursors of known or novel miRNAs sequences) or Sf TE copies (15.5&#x02013;18.4%) corresponding to putative piRNAs or endo-siRNAs. 16&#x02013;16.7% of them matched to rRNA, and 0.2&#x02013;2.4% to tRNA, the most abundant RNA classes expected in the cells. These data show that the sRNA sequences were enriched in functional miRNAs or TE-interacting RNAs compared to those resulting from degradation of ribosomal or transfer RNAs. We found also sncRNA sequences matching to miRNA precursors of plants (<italic>Zea</italic> or <italic>Oryza</italic>). It is expected since sncRNAs have been extracted from whole larvae feeding on plants. The lack of sequence homology between miRNA families in plants and animals (with exception of one family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) as well as differences in their biogenesis and mode of action suggested that miRNAs have evolved independently in both kingdoms from an ancient siRNA mechanism already present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The presence of plant miRNA reads in larval samples is thus not expected to interfere with the study of animal miRNAs performed in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Annotation of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> miRNA genes</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>miRDeep2 analysis</title><p id="Par9">To detect miRNA genes, raw sequencing data were analyzed with miRDeep2 software. miRDeep2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] maps the sRNA reads to the genome and excises potential miRNA precursors sequences from the genome. The secondary structures of the miRNA precursors are predicted and their stability is estimated by RNAfold. mirDeep2 uses a probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis by the Dicer protein to score frequency and compatibility of mapping of the small RNA sequence reads (the signature) on the secondary structure of the miRNA genomic precursors (the structure) as compared to a non-miRNA precursor hairpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Read stacks correspond to mature miRNA sequences. The score reflects the likelihood of each precursor to be a genuine miRNA. Furthermore, since the algorithm may generate hairpins with read stacks that have no connection with miRNA biology, corresponding to false positives, miRDeep2 estimates the rate of false positive by shuffling the observed combinations of structures and signatures and submit them to the core algorithm. The difference in score distribution between the genuine combinations and the control ones is used to estimate the number of false positive novel miRNAs for varying score cut-offs. The sequence of mature predicted miRNAs are compared to mature miRNA sequences contained in miRBase (release 21) which allows to sort them in two classes, known or novel depending if they existed or not in miRBase. The genomes of the C strain (v3.1) and the R strain (v1.0) were used as references using a pool of sequence reads from either the C or the R strain, respectively.

From [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], AP-2 is expressed during Drosophila embryogenesis in the maxillary segment and neural structures, whereas during larval development, it is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and the leg, antennal and labial imaginal disks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a Drosophila AP-2 mutant, defects in proboscis development and leg-joint formation have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We found a homolog of the graves disease carrier protein, a protein of as yet uncharacterized function that belongs to the mitochondrial metabolite carrier family (which includes the ADP/ATP translocator, the phosphate carrier and the hydrogen ion uncoupling protein). Among the down-regulated targets of miR-263a-5p, were found a protein of unknown function and a cuticular protein. Among the down-regulated targets of miR-10-5p, two genes coding for transporters (proton-coupled folate transporter, facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1) were identified. Folates are a family of B9 vitamins found in nature primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF). 5-MethylTHF provides the methyl group for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and therefore is necessary for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, which is required for a variety of methylation reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, folates are the sources of a methylene moiety for the de novo synthesis of thymidylate from deoxyuridylate and two formate moieties for the de novo synthesis of the purine ring. PCFT has been extensively studied in humans due to the importance of folates in cancer progression, however it has not been studied in insects. In humans, PCFT is expressed at the acidic microenvironment of the apical brush-border membrane of the proximal small intestine and allows the intestinal absorption of folates. In humans and mice, loss of function mutations in PCFT, results in severe systemic folate deficiency with anemia, sometimes pancytopenia, hypo-immunoglobulinemia and gastrointestinal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">This analysis of putative targets of DE miRNA reveals that they control important pathways necessary for cellular or organismal homeostasis during insect-plant interaction. Although we provide transcriptomic evidence of downregulation of putative targets, their experimental validation will require additional efforts like the use of biotin tagged miRNAs to capture them and/or translation profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which will be the focus of future work.</p><p id="Par31">For expression analysis of the predicted target genes, insect samples were collected after two generations on plants whereas for the study of miRNA expression they were collected after three generations. This was to ensure dilution of miRNAs putatively maternally inherited (it is the case for miR-34 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> for instance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]) and related to the artificial diet on which the insect fed before the reciprocal transplant experiment on plants started. We considered that in controlled experimental conditions of growth, gene expression during each successive insect developmental cycle is reproducible and comparable from one generation to another (Since <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> is a quarantine organism in France, we performed the RT experiment in large incubators with controlled hygrometry, temperature and light conditions). If the plant exerted a selection pressure, gene allele frequencies may have changed but not significantly between two generations since the laboratory strain that we used has a limited genetic polymorphism.</p><p id="Par32">For differential expression analysis of miR genes and their targets, two biological replicates of the reciprocal transplant experiment have been performed. Since the first use of RNA-Seq to analyze transcriptomic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], we know more on the parameters necessary to optimize detection of differentially expressed genes. Lamarre et al. recently showed that the read depth in part compensates for the number of replicates to increase the ratio of differentially expressed genes detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]: with 20 million reads (for 20,000 DE genes - corresponding to a coverage of 1000 reads per gene) and 2 replicates, 85% of DE genes are found, and 8 replicates are needed to reach a ratio of 100%, while with 2.5 million reads (~ coverage 125 reads/gene) and 2 replicates, only 15% of DE genes are detected and the use of 8 replicates increases the ratio of DE genes to only 60%. In our miR differential expression analysis, we performed only two biological replicates. However, the read depth in each SfC library (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) was 42 million on average, with more than 20% of the sequences having the expected size for miRs (21 to 23&#x000a0;nt), this corresponds to an average coverage of &#x0003e;&#x02009;39,688 reads per miR gene, a higher coverage than the maximal one used in the study of Lamarre et al.. Lamarre et al. also showed that the rate of false positives obtained with DESeq2 is minimal with 2 replicates and increases with the number or replicates. According to them, 70% of true positives can be detected with two replicates and this number increases with the number of replicates. We conclude that our experimental design enabled detection of a reasonable number of reliable DE miR candidates although more repetitions may be necessary to deepen the study.</p><p id="Par33">In the same line, our differential expression analysis was done from RNA extracted from whole body of the larvae feeding on plants. We are aware that this experimental design may underestimate the number of miRs showing variation in their expression due to the fact that overexpression in one tissue may be masked by down regulation in another one. It will be the subject of future effort to look for expression variation tissue by tissue.</p><p id="Par34">The miRNAs expression differences that we uncovered between the host-strains may result from genetic drift and also possibly from divergent selection by the environment, in this case the different host-plants. To identify the latter, we searched for the miRNAs that were differentially expressed both between strains on the same plant and within strains in response to the host-plant. Interestingly, we found that all the miRNAs expression difference between strains on plants (6/6, miR-10-5p, miR-34-5p, miR-263a-5p, miR-278-5p, miR279b-3p, miR-308-3p) were also involved in response to the host-plant in SfC. By contrast, one miRNA only (miR-278-5p) out of the six that showed constitutive difference between strains, showed also variation in response to the host-plant in SfR. By measuring the fitness of the insects on plants, we had found better survival of the C strain on corn compared to rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] suggesting that SfC was adapted to corn. The miRNAs that are both deregulated between strains and in response to plant may be involved in this adaptive evolution of SfC.</p><p id="Par35">MiRNAs have been shown to be involved in response to various environmental changes, like response to starvation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], to freezing and anoxia stress in the freeze tolerant fly <italic>Eurosta solidaginis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], to thermal plasticity of the Senegalese sole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], to drought in Tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, by regulating phenotypic plasticity, miRNAs may have also played a role in evolutionary adaptation as has been discussed in the case of human miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
