    "The rice plant produces an amorphous silica layer in the husk covering the brown rice grain as a part of a protective respiration system. The layer shows high permeation molecular flow while the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherm indicates the existence of nanometer-sized pores. Here, we interpret the inner structure of the layer as a porous network consisting of void spheres with a degree of 2-5 and tunnels with a length of 2-7 nm based on the transmission electron microscopy images. In the network, the gas molecules travel through the tunnels and move in random directions after collisions with the walls of the spheres. A tree network was introduced to understand the permeance of the layer and the reflection of the molecule of the root or parent sphere was estimated for a specific case. The tree becomes a graph with cycles in a finite space such as the silica layer and the reflection of the root sphere in the graph converses to that of the tree. On the basis of the properties of the network, the high permeance of the silica layer in the rice husk can be explained. It is suggested that the specific system restricts the movements of the gas molecules and can be applied to reduce the size of gas phase separation and chemical reactor systems providing a new view to understand nanoscaled porous materials."
