This is because many infant food products are rice based, and rice is ~10-fold elevated in inorganic arsenic compared to most other foods. The European Commission (EC) has acted on this concern setting stricter standards for infants, 100 &#x003bc;g of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 &#x003bc;g/kg), as compared to adults (200 &#x003bc;g/kg), for rice based foods, a law that was brought into place in 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016. Here we investigate how this law has impacted on inorganic arsenic in baby food products in the UK market, and compare the findings to previous baby food surveys taken before and just after the law came into place. We find that for a wide range of UK infant products that the new regulations are being adhered to, with all samples surveyed, being under 100 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic. The prevalence of pure rice products had decreased in the UK, and there appears to be careful sourcing of the rice used in these products to ensure conformity with regulations. There has been an increased presence of mixed cereal products, with rice and maize as the main ingredient, appearing on the UK market, with varying rice contents for infant porridges, cakes and mueslis, with the latter being a relatively innovative product for infant foods. There was a highly significant correlation (P&#x0003c;0.0001) between rice content and inorganic arsenic concentration across all infant foods. When UK infant rice cakes, breakfast cereals and porridges were compare to their general, i.e. not labelled specifically for being for infant consumption, equivalent it was found that the adult foods generally exceeded the 100 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic standard for infant foods. Thus, infants should not be given rice products not specifically labelled as being for them if a lower inorganic arsenic diet is to be maintained.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice is widely used as an ingredient in weaning products [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, inorganic arsenic is a non-threshold carcinogen that is found circa. 10-times higher in rice than in other staple foods [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Inorganic arsenic, as well as being a carcinogen, also impacts on child I.Q., growth rates, and immune development, amongst other effects, at concentrations that can be found in the diet [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Children are particularly more exposed to food-borne toxins, such as inorganic arsenic, as they consume circa. 3-times as much food on a body mass basis as adults [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Signes-Pastor et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that when infants&#x02019; urine was sampled before and after weaning that inorganic arsenic and its metabolites monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), with DMAA being also the other major arsenic species in rice [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], increased 4.5-fold after weaning. Surveys of arsenic in rice based weaning/baby/infant foods have led to growing concern regarding the exposure of infants to arsenic [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>An assessment of the risks posed by rice as an exposure route of inorganic arsenic to infants [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has led to the European Union introducing new laws on the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2016, setting the standard for inorganic arsenic in rice based products intended for young children, those below 5-years of age, at 100 &#x003bc;g of inorganic arsenic per kg of food (100 &#x003bc;g/kg) [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is half the standard for polished (white) rice, and a third of that for puffed rice [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When arsenic in food containing rice marketed at young children, less than 5-years old, was surveyed in the UK just after the new standards were set, ~three-quarter of products were above the legal threshold [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Levels had in fact increased from a pre-ban survey [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Typical baby foods that may be elevated in inorganic arsenic are rice porridge, rice crackers/wafers, and puffed rice cereals [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these also have general, i.e. not labelled specifically for babies, counterparts, and the stricter EU regulations only apply to products labelled specifically for consumption by young children [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This constitutes a loophole, and unsuspecting parents have a choice between to almost identical products, but one labelled for children and one labelled for general consumption, and with a potential divergence in inorganic arsenic content. Also, studies have focussed on the UK [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with few surveys of inorganic arsenic in baby foods elsewhere in Europe, and all of which were before the new regulations of 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this present study, we set out to establish inorganic arsenic levels in UK baby foods, as well as their general, i.e. not specifically labelled as being for infant consumption, equivalents for the UK. This was to observe how the new EU laws were being enforced, and to identify if specific children&#x02019;s products had diverged from generic porridges, grain cakes and breakfast cereals. The findings of the survey were also compared concentrations found in previous investigations [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The results were interpreted with respect as to what is the best dietary advice to give parents of young children, and how to avoid products with higher exposures, and strategies for further reducing children&#x02019;s exposure to inorganic arsenic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sampling strategy</title><p>For the current survey, samples of individual products were sampled from separate retail outlets, to give duplicate or triplicate samples.

There were a range of products for babies that contain rice and these can be considered pure rice products, cakes and porridge, and multi-grain products, cakes, porridges and muesli. For generic products, cakes, both pure rice, and puffed rice, white and wholemeal, were widely available. Multi-grain products usually included maize, but could include quinoa, oats and potato in various quantities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194700.s001">S1 File</xref>, &#x0201c;all samples detail tab&#x0201d;). All products specifically for children fell under the 100 &#x003bc;g/kg EU inorganic arsenic standard, with medians also below this threshold. For baby porridges, pure rice had a median of 66 &#x003bc;g/kg, as compared to 10 &#x003bc;g/kg for multi-grain. A similar difference was observed between children&#x02019;s pure rice cakes and multi-grain, 60 versus 8 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic, respectively. There were only 2 brands of pure baby porridge available in the stores surveyed. The differences between rice versus multi-grain were both highly significant (P&#x0003c;0.0001) for both porridges and cakes. Multi-grain cakes for children were not significantly lower than for adults, but the variance was lower. Generic rice cakes had a median above the EU inorganic arsenic standard at 120 &#x003bc;g/kg. These crackers tended, 13 out of 14, to contain wholemeal rice. Generic white (milled before puffing) puffed rice had a median inorganic arsenic content of 95 &#x003bc;g/kg, while wholemeal puffed rice was the highest of any product class at 140 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic.

The approaches taken by manufactures are three-fold. For the 1<sup>st</sup> approach, pure rice products, such as porridges and crackers, it appears that low inorganic rice has been specifically sourced for formulation. The 2<sup>nd</sup> approach appears to be a lower representation of pure rice products being produced/available, though this would take manufacturer survey to quantify. The 3<sup>rd</sup>, and most radical, approach is to blend rice with other gluten free grains, as well as the introduction of multi-grain mueslis for infants, to dilute out the inorganic arsenic in rice. Although the manufacturers have not stated or advertised this approach, it seems that they have, moved to meet EU standards by using dilution of the rice content of infant foods. However, diversification of grains in the diets of children needs to take account of all risks, not just inorganic arsenic. For baby foods, the rice alternatives favoured by manufacturers are maize, oats, quinoa and potato, all gluten free, as preferred, particularly at weaning, in the infant market. Maize and oats can be problematic with respect to their mycotoxin content, and surveys of infant cereals show that relatively high percentages had mycotoxin concentrations exceeding those allowed by EU standards [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Rice is, generally, low in mycotoxins [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This UK reduction in rice based infants&#x02019; foods will lead to lower levels of inorganic arsenic exposure in children, however, more can be done. It is important to note that the EU standard of 100 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was not set following a risk assessment, in fact the logic of 100 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic as a standard has not been explained, and the same as for the 200 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic standard for non-infant rice products [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The rational of setting the infant standard at half that for adults seems arbitrary as young children are effectively exposed to 3-times more arsenic than adults due to their high food consumption rate on a body mass basis [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the fact that children appear more sensitive to inorganic arsenic than adults [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even a primitive risk assessment, based on food consumption rates, would suggest that the children&#x02019;s thresholds for maximum concentrations of inorganic arsenic in rice should be at least a 1/3 of that for adults, though even lower would be better. A illustration of how the infant foods regulation is not well thought though can be achieved by considering inorganic arsenic intakes by babies from rice based products. Assuming a 20g portion for a 9.25 kg (1-year old) child [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a 100 &#x003bc;g/kg EU inorganic arsenic rice based infants food limit, this means a child will receive a dose of 0.22 &#x003bc;g per kg body weight per sitting. Assuming consumption of 1L a typical daily consumption) of 3 &#x003bc;g/L water for a 70 kg adult person, dose of 0.042 &#x003bc;g/kg bodyweight per day (&#x003bc;g/kg/d), inorganic is the estimated 4&#x02013;7 in 10,000 excess bladder and lung cancer life-time exposure risk, considered baseline [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The EU, US and WHO [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] water standards are 10 &#x003bc;g/L, and this same body weight arsenic consumption for a 70 kg adult at 10 &#x003bc;g/L consuming 1L per day is 0.142 &#x003bc;g/kg/d. A single portion of a rice based meal at the EU limit will take the child over the adult 3 &#x003bc;g/L water ingestion by 5-fold, and at the 10 &#x003bc;g/L water standard by 1.5-fold, given that babies may be fed more than one rice based meal per day. While 10 &#x003bc;g/L is the EU, US and WHO standard, few around the world are actually exposed to this concentration of inorganic arsenic in their drinking water, yet children are exposed daily substantially more inorganic arsenic, on a body weight dose basis, from rice based foods. While the epidemiological modelling is or life-time exposures [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], children are known to be more susceptible to inorganic arsenic than adults [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The rational for setting stricter EU, and elsewhere, standards for inorganic arsenic in rice based baby foods, and adult foods as rice is again here a dominant exposure route, is compelling, as we have previously highlighted [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our results show that attaining lower inorganic arsenic standards in infant foods is readily achievable, i.e. the manufacturers have already done this, with the median concentration in multi-grain cereals porridge that contain rice as an ingredient being 9.75 &#x003bc;g/kg, a tenth lower than the EC [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] standard. Thus, the move away from away from pure rice cereal products, and the sourcing of low arsenic rice appears to be a positive step for the UK market.</p><p>The WHO, although it does not have an infant standard, has set a standard for polished rice, at the same value as the EU, 200 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Again, this WHO standard was not set on a risk assessment basis, but at least the logic of the WHO decision was outlined in their discussion documents [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The WHO discussions around where to set an inorganic arsenic in rice standard explicitly state that the standard was set so as to keep most of the rice in the global food-chain in circulation [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. That is, the WHO standard was set on economic grounds, supposedly using the As Low as Reasonably Practical (ALARP) principle [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our UK findings presented here confound this WHO ALARP assessment interpretation as pure baby rice can be sourced that is below 100 &#x003bc;g/kg, half the WHO [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] standard, for a commercial product. It is clear that tighter law setting, 100 &#x003bc;g/kg for the EU for infant foods vs. 200 &#x003bc;g/kg generically for EU and WHO, is an incentive for lowering inorganic arsenic in the diet. Given that inorganic arsenic is a non-threshold carcinogen [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], i.e. that every dose carries a carcinogenic risk, exposures to babies, and adults, should be minimised.</p><p>Other strategies, besides dilution with other grains, could be employed to further lower inorganic arsenic content of rice based baby foods. Inorganic arsenic is readily cooked out of rice, at removal rates of 80% [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As infant products are normally precooked, inorganic arsenic removal at the food processing stage is a tractable option. Also, rice for infant foods, could be sourced from low arsenic rice regions [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This appears to what has occurred for pure rice infant porridges and crackers in the UK from the results presented here.</p><p>While the implementation of a 100 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic standard for baby foods has had a positive impact of reducing the exposure of infants to arsenic, the law does not take into account parents who will feed their children foods classified as not being labelled specifically for young children [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such foods include rice grain, and parents who make their babies meals from fresh ingredients will expose their children to higher inorganic arsenic levels than if pre-packaged foods labelled as being for children were given as a meal instead. Also, as illustrated by the findings here. If non-infant food labelled rice breakfast cereals or rice crackers are given to young children, then their exposures will be higher than giving them the equivalent child-food product. Puffed rice is off particular concern as it is a food widely given to children as a breakfast cereal, but the EU law allows it to have the highest inorganic arsenic concentration of any rice product, 300 &#x003bc;g/kg [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>As rice is not just a problem for infants, it being a chronic carcinogen with risks measured over life-times [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194700.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], if inorganic arsenic exposures from rice can be reduced for infants they also can be reduced for adults. Again, sourcing is a solution for non-rice growing countries, such as the northern European countries focussed on in this study, or from simple changes in cooking, such as pre-soaking and using a large water: rice (ratio) [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For countries where rice is the subsistence carbohydrate source, as well as changing cooking, rice processing, such as parboiling practice [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], can also make an impact. Diversification of diet is also an option, and this is would generally help the nutritional health of the populace in countries with rice subsistence diets [<xref rid="pone.0194700.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
