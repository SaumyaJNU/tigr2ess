However, their effects on leaf stay-green characteristics, dry matter accumulation, and translocation after anthesis remain unclear. In this study, post-anthesis N uptake and translocation between two different rice genotypes (Yongyou12 and Zhongzheyou1) were compared through soil nitrogen leaching treatments at the meiosis stage (MST) and anthesis stage(AST) respectively, and their effects on leaf stay-green duration, photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and translocation during ripening and yield formation were estimated. The results showed that the soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N contents in Yongyou12 pots decreased significantly, and post-anthesis N uptake was 2.0&#x02013;3.4 fold higher in Yongyou12 than in Zhongzheyou1. The activities of N-metabolism enzymes and antioxidant enzymes were higher, and flag-leaf photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation during ripening were greater, in Yongyou12 than in Zhongzheyou1. However, insufficient available soil N led to significant decreases in the activities of N- metabolism enzymes, decreased flag-leaf photosynthesis, increased translocation of dry matter and N pre-anthesis, accelerated leaf senescence, shorter duration of the leaf stay-green period, and decreased dry matter accumulation and grain plumpness. In addition, the effect of N uptake after anthesis on yield is greater for rice genotypes that depend on post-anthesis dry matter accumulation and an expanded sink capacity.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is one of the most important cereal crops globally, being the primary food source for more than half the world&#x02019;s population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Grain filling, a crucial determinant of grain yield and rice productivity, is characterized by the duration and rate of grain filling, and varies widely among genotypes. It has been reported that a longer period of grain filling, which leads to higher cumulative mean temperature and cumulative solar radiation, leads to greater dry matter accumulation and is the main determinant of grain yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

The regulation of N uptake by N-metabolism enzymes can not only enhance the photosynthetic capacity of leaves, but also prolong the stay-green duration of leaves, so that N-metabolism enzymes remain present and active in the leaves for longer.

Plants in the control group were not subjected to a leaching treatment. Both of the soil N-leaching treatments significantly affected the amounts of nitrate-N and ammonium-N in soil around the two rice genotypes, but the total soil N content was unchanged (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E,F</xref>). The contents of nitrate-N and ammonium-N in soil decreased rapidly and remarkably by 53.6&#x02013;59.3% and 43.5&#x02013;43.9% in the MST treatment, and by 42.1&#x02013;43.1% and 35.0&#x02013;40.9% in the AST treatment, compared with the control (no soil N-leaching). This effectively decreased the soil available N supply. After anthesis, the soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N contents in ZZY1 pots gradually increased, and the treatments could be ranked, from highest soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N contents to lowest, as follows: control &#x0003e;&#x02009;MST&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;AST (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,C</xref>). During grain filling, the soil available N content again decreased, and there were no significant differences among the treatments. In contrast, the soil available N content clearly decreased in YY12 pots from leaching to maturity, except for a slight increase within 10 days after anthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,D</xref>). Similarly, the soil available N content was highest in the YY12 control pots, followed those in the MST treatment and finally those in the AST treatment.

Nitrogen-metabolism enzymes play an important role in the absorption and assimilation of soil N. In higher plants, NR catalyses the reduction of nitrate to nitrite with pyridine nucleotide during N assimilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The GS/GOGAT cycle is the main pathway of ammonium assimilation in higher plants, and approximately 95% of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation occurs via this cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In this study, when the soil N was sufficient during grain filling, the higher activities of N-metabolism enzymes in leaves promoted N uptake and assimilation from the soil (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, when the soil N supply was insufficient, the enzyme activities decreased significantly. An increase in GDH activity provides ammonium that can re-enter the N cycle to meet the N demands during grain filling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Higher activities of N-metabolism enzymes increased post-anthesis N uptake, thereby allowing leaves to stay green for longer. This meant that N-metabolism enzymes were retained and remained active for longer, which further promoted N absorption and formed a beneficial cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The strong and active root systems of high-yield rice are another reason for the high N uptake at the grain-filling stage, but the main reason was that the grain-filling period was long enough for sufficient N absorption, rather than relying on the N uptake rate after anthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Descriptive model of the roles of post-anthesis nitrogen uptake and translocation in grain yield development.

Besides improving the photosynthetic capacity, a long green-leaf period delays leaf senescence and prolongs the period of effective photosynthesis, but it requires a large amount of N uptake after anthesis.

This research showed that the higher the N uptake after anthesis, the higher the chlorophyll content and Pn of the functional leaves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and dry matter accumulation during grain filling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>), although it had little effect on total dry mass per plant at maturity (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In contrast, the N content and photosynthetic function of the leaves decreased significantly when the N supply was insufficient (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At the same time, the leaf MDA content increased significantly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and leaf senescence was accelerated, which shortened the duration of the photosynthetic period. Carbon is the main dry matter source for grain filling, and carbon assimilation decreased after anthesis, which affected grain plumpness and grain weight. Antioxidant enzymes also play important roles in delaying senescence and prolonging the stay-green period of leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We observed that a high capacity to scavenge reactive species resulted in lower membrane lipid peroxidation and a prolonged stay-green period of leaves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

In another study, 64% of the pre-anthesis N translocation was derived from the leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, while excessive loss of leaf N led to leaf senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and shortening of the photosynthetic period. Our results confirmed that a deficiency in N uptake after anthesis accelerated the transport of stored carbon and N, decreased the photosynthetic capacity, accelerated leaf senescence, reduced post-anthesis dry matter assimilation, and decreased the 1000-grain weight, which was the main cause of yield reduction. Nitrogen uptake after anthesis in ZZY1 was only one-third to one-half of that in YY12 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Although post-anthesis N deficiency in ZZY1 also reduced the photosynthetic capacity, photosynthetic duration, and 1000-grain weight, it had a much smaller effect on grain yield than in YY12 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The meiosis stage is a critical period for rice yield formation. A poor soil N supply at this stage reduced not only the 1000-grain weight of YY12, but also the number of spikelets per panicle, which is highly detrimental to rice genotypes that achieve a high yield through producing a large spikelet population (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">As discussed above, high activities of N-metabolism enzymes and antioxidant enzymes and low pre-anthesis N translocation were related to high N uptake after anthesis, inhibition of leaf senescence, increased photosynthetic capacity, and a prolonged leaf stay-green period so as to take full advantage of light and temperature resources. These characteristics conferred a strong advantage for post-anthesis dry matter accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Furthermore, large N uptake after anthesis also promoted the translocation of pre-anthesis stored dry matter instead of N, which could realize the yield potential based on the huge spikelet population. In contrast, weak N uptake after anthesis enhanced the excessive translocation of accumulated N before anthesis, accelerated leaf senescence, reduced the assimilation capacity, and decreased the period of carbon and N assimilation after anthesis, which led to insufficient grain filling and lower yield.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="Par18">This experiment was conducted from May to November in 2015 and 2016 at the China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou (30&#x000b0;04&#x02032;N, 119&#x000b0;55&#x02032;E), China. <italic>Indica-Japonica</italic> hybrid rice Yongyou12 (YY12) and <italic>Indica</italic> hybrid rice Zhongzheyou1 (ZZY1) were used as the experimental materials.
