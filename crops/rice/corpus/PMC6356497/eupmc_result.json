    "A content analysis was used to investigate the marketing strategies, serving size, and nutrition quality in Taiwan popular children's snacks and drinks. A total of 361 snacks and 246 drinks were collected. It was found that 38.6% of snacks and 25.3% of drinks were child-targeted (CT) foods, and 78.1% and 85.4% of the snacks and drinks had health and nutrition marketing (HNM). Serving size was significantly positively correlated to calories among different food categories in this study. Only the CT breads, ready-to-eat cereals, and fruit/vegetable juice had smaller serving sizes than did the corresponding non-CT products. These CT products had significantly fewer calories than did the corresponding non-CT products. Approximately 30% of snacks and 18% of drinks had both CT and HNM. Moreover, 82.7% of CT snacks and 100.0% of CT drinks with HNM were high in sugar. About 95% of foods with no added sugar claim were high sugar. CT foods are not necessarily healthier than non-CT foods, even the CT food with HNM. Health professionals should help parents assess the nutrition quality of the popular children's foods. Further research was needed to investigate the effect of these marketing strategies and serving size on children's food consumption."
