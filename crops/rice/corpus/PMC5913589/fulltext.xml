Traditional assessment of drought resistance traits, such as stay-green and leaf-rolling, has utilized manual measurements, that are often subjective, error-prone, poorly quantified and time consuming. To relieve this phenotyping bottleneck, we demonstrate a feasible, robust and non-destructive method that dynamically quantifies response to drought, under both controlled and field conditions. Firstly, RGB images of individual rice plants at different growth points were analyzed to derive 4 features that were influenced by imposition of drought. These include a feature related to the ability to stay green, which we termed greenness plant area ratio (GPAR) and 3 shape descriptors [total plant area/bounding rectangle area ratio (TBR), perimeter area ratio (PAR) and total plant area/convex hull area ratio (TCR)]. Experiments showed that these 4 features were capable of discriminating reliably between drought resistant and drought sensitive accessions, and dynamically quantifying the drought response under controlled conditions across time (at either daily or half hourly time intervals). We compared the 3 shape descriptors and concluded that PAR was more robust and sensitive to leaf-rolling than the other shape descriptors. In addition, PAR and GPAR proved to be effective in quantification of drought response in the field. Moreover, the values obtained in field experiments using the collection of rice varieties were correlated with those derived from pot-based experiments. The general applicability of the algorithms is demonstrated by their ability to probe archival <italic>Miscanthus</italic> data previously collected on an independent platform. In conclusion, this image-based technology is robust providing a platform-independent tool for quantifying drought response that should be of general utility for breeding and functional genomics in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>high-throughput phenotyping</kwd><kwd>drought response</kwd><kwd>stay-green</kwd><kwd>leaf-rolling</kwd><kwd>RGB image analysis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="9"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="7909"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice, a staple food that feeds half of the world's population (Yang et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), is one of the most water-hungry crops (Xia et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Widespread pollution, climatic change, and a growing population further aggravate the water shortage problem. Thus, water scarcity has become an urgent global and environmental problem (Hussain and Mumtaz, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Trenberth et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, water availability varies geospatially and across seasons, making drought a key restraining factor in rice production (Uga et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). When drought stress occurs during the reproductive stage, rice yield is very significantly reduced (Venuprasad et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Vikram et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Drought resistant varieties assist in maintaining and improving rice yield under such conditions. Therefore, as in many crops, one of the major targets in breeding is to develop drought resistant varieties. To accelerate the identification of novel drought resistant varieties in breeding programs, a rapid species-agnostic method for evaluation of drought-resistance under diverse conditions is a necessary prerequisite. Since cost-effective solutions are likely to be based on visible attributes, we explored the readily observable (macroscopic) reactions of leaves to drought.</p><p>As with many species of grass, rice leaves roll, and change their overall geometry in response to drought conditions and then recover when water is available (Begg et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Tardieu, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, leaf rolling and general leaf geometry could be useful indicators and have already been widely used to identify drought resistant varieties (Richards et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Variation in leaf rolling has been recorded using visual scores (O'Toole and Cruz, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Turner, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Color change is another commonly reported reaction, as leaves tend to become yellow when subjected to drought. Therefore, prolonged persistence of green color (sometimes also referred to as the stay-green trait) could be an appropriate indicator for identifying drought tolerance varieties (Fang and Xiong, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In maize, the stay-green trait was considered to be closely related to yield (King and Purcell, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Similar to leaf-rolling, the stay-green trait is traditionally evaluated using a manual visual score (Kholov&#x000e1; and Vadez, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sukumaran et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The visual scores can only provide qualitative measurement of drought response. Most importantly, visual scores as evaluated by different people may be different, suggesting that the visual scores are subjective and error-prone. Continuous quantification of the drought response through measurement of leaf rolling and stay-green could, therefore, provide a useful means to monitor drought response. This would have particular advantages for large dispersed breeding trials.</p><p>Optical imaging and computer-assisted feature extraction have the advantages of being non-destructive, potentially high-throughput and objective. They have been widely applied in phenotyping plant growth and development (Spalding and Miller, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Duan et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Montagnoli et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Rebolledo et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), seeds (Duan et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), root systems (Lobet et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), plant disease symptoms (Mutka and Bart, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and plant abiotic stress (Altamimi et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Fisher et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Malinowska et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Honsdorf et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) calculated 8 imaging parameters, along with 3 harvest parameters and 4 indices, to evaluate the kinetics of growth under early drought stress and detect drought tolerance QTL in Barley. Petrozza et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) used non-invasive imaging to evaluate the plant water content, plant health state, state of the photosynthetic apparatus and digital biomass to characterize the response to drought stress in tomato. Born et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) adopted terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to measure the leaf water content for monitoring plant drought stress response. Stay-green or senescence was also calculated and used to evaluate drought responses (Petrozza et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Malinowska et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research on quantification of leaf-rolling using these nondestructive approaches. Sirault et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) applied smoothing splines to skeletonized images of transverse wheat leaf sections to quantify the inter-genotypic variation for hydronastic leaf rolling in wheat. Neilson et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) estimated the degree of leaf rolling in sorghum by comparing projected plant area in the late afternoon (when the plants are least hydrated) with area early the following morning (when hydration would be expected to be maximal). They concluded that the decrease of projected leaf area was related to the degree of leaf-rolling over the diurnal cycle and the method seems effective over this time period.

To dynamically quantify rice drought response under controlled conditions, 40 accessions (20 drought resistant accessions and 20 drought sensitive accessions, Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">2</xref>) with 4 replications of each genotype were grown in the greenhouse during summer, 2013. Each accession was deemed as drought resistant or drought sensitive by 3 experts evaluated manually based on its leaf-rolling and stay-green ability. The germination dates of the 40 accessions were staggered to ensure synchronized flowering. Seeds were sown in the field. Twenty-day-old seedlings were transplanted to pots containing 4.5 kg soil and transferred to a controlled environment. When an accession grew to the booting stage (panicle elongation), the plant was imaged by RAP (Rice Automatic Phenotyping, Yang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to collect image features before application of stress. Irrigation was then stopped to allow drought stress to occur. Soil water content was measured using TRIME-PICO32 (IMKO Micromodultechnik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) on the basis of time domain reflectometry (TDR). When the soil water content reduced to 15% (TDR value), the plants were watered to maintain the soil water content at 15% (TDR value) for 5 days. Then images of plants under stress conditions were collected using RAP. The time interval between the two imaging times was approximately 1 week, depending on the decline in soil water. The 4 image-derived features, whose behavior seemed related to drought response (1 feature related to stay-green and 3 shape descriptors, hereafter referred to as 4 drought-related features), were extracted and tested for their ability to discriminate known drought resistant accessions from drought sensitive accessions (see section Discrimination Between Drought Resistant and Drought Sensitive Accessions).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The experimental design for dynamic quantification of drought response for <bold>(A)</bold> rice under controlled conditions, <bold>(B)</bold> rice under field conditions, and <bold>(C)</bold>

All the plants were imaged daily by RAP from DAP 58 to DAP 70. The 4 drought-related features were extracted and analyzed to study the drought response at daily intervals. To study the detailed dynamics of the response to drought stress and rehydration, 2 accessions, namely <italic>Maweinian</italic> and <italic>Zaoxian240</italic> were monitored over the course of a day at approximately 30 min. intervals in summer, 2016. At the booting stage, irrigation was interrupted to allow drought stress to occur. While the soil remained visibly wet and no leaf-rolling occurred, images were taken to record the plants before stress. When the leaves of the plants started to roll, images were taken at approximately 30 min intervals to record the plants response under drought stress. After all the leaves of the plant rolled up, the plant was re-watered to collect images after rehydration at approximately 30 min intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design for dynamic quantification of rice drought response under field conditions</title><p>To test whether these drought-related features could be used to quantify drought response in the open field, 42 accessions with 2 replicates (Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">2</xref>) were planted in an experimental paddy field (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) in summer, 2016. Each accession was planted as a single 90 &#x000d7; 90 cm<sup>2</sup> field-plot containing 20 plants (5 rows and 4 columns). A guard row was planted as a boundary between the field-plots to depress any edge effects. Images were taken with a consumer grade Nikon D40 camera. At the booting stage, irrigation was cut off to allow the drought stress to occur. Images were taken at five stages, which we classified as well watered (before stress, C), mild drought stress (D1), moderate drought stress (D2), severe drought stress (D3), and after rehydration (R). Specifically, when there was no water in the field but the soil kept wet (no visible leaf-rolling), images for plants before stress were collected. The time interval between different level of drought stress (D1 and D2, D2, and D3) was 5&#x02013;6 days. Water was supplied again immediately after images under severe drought stress were taken. A week after rehydration, images for plants after rehydration were taken. Drought-related features were extracted from the images at all 5 stages to quantify the drought response.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design for dynamic quantification of leaf-rolling in <italic>Miscanthus</italic></title><p>To evaluate our method on other species grown on other phenotyping platforms, RGB side-view archival images from 39 accessions of the elephant grass <italic>Miscanthus</italic> were acquired from the large plant platform at National Plant Phenomics Centre (NPPC), IBERS, Aberystwyth University, UK (Malinowska et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The 39 <italic>Miscanthus</italic> accessions (8 replicates for each accession) were planted at 07/ April, 2014, and moved to large plant platform at 12/ May, 2014. After transfer to NPPC, plants were grown for 2 weeks in well-watered conditions (90% relative soil water). Drought stress treatments were applied at roughly the time of emergence of the fifth leaf of the main stem. 4 replicates for each accession were treated for control (90% relative water capacity), and the other 4 replicates were treated for drought (taken to and held at 15&#x02013;20% relative water capacity). Lateral side view RGB images (2 per day per plant) had been acquired daily from DAP 37 to DAP 71 and were re-used here to extract and calculate the drought related features (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

In contrast to PAR, TBR and TCR decreased after drought stress in drought resistant accessions yet increased in drought sensitive accessions. These results show that the 4 drought-related features are capable of quantifying the differences in response to drought between drought resistant accessions and drought sensitive accessions.</p><p>Plant size is a known variable that affects water use and potentially could be a confounding factor in the interpretation of these features. To estimate the extent to which plant size affected the features, we used TDR as a direct measure of soil water to impose water stress and then compared plants of comparable biomass. When we surveyed the entire population based on biomass (dry weight), there was only a weak relationship between shoot dry weight and PAR change (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.22, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). And there were moderate relationships between shoot dry weight and the other 2 shape descriptors (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> were 0.41 and 0.35 for TBR change and TCR change, respectively, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). The change of a drought-related feature was calculated as the feature value after stress minus the feature value before stress. Genotypes of comparable biomass could have either high scores or low scores (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the features are unlikely to be directly related to plant size, and are more likely to be affected by actual water use and the ability of the leaves to conserve water.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Scatter plot for plant dry weight after stress (g) and <bold>(A)</bold> the PAR change, <bold>(B)</bold> TBR change and <bold>(C)</bold> TCR change.

Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">1A</xref> illustrates general dynamics of the 4 drought-related features for rice. Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">1B</xref> illustrates the dynamics of the 4 drought-related features for a randomly selected accession <italic>PeiC12</italic>2. In general, as the drought stress intensified, PAR increased while TBR, TCR and GPAR decreased, which was in agreement with theoretical predictions. Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">1C</xref> shows the dynamics of the first derivative of the 4 drought-related features for accession <italic>PeiC122</italic>. The first derivative of a specified feature was defined as X<sub>i</sub>- X<sub>i&#x02212;1</sub>, where X<sub>i</sub> was the feature value at the i-th day. From day 5(D5) to day 6(D6), the peak or valley of the first derivative of the 3 shape descriptors indicated visibly detectable leaf-rolling. As shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">1C</xref>, visibly detectable leaf-rolling occurred at D6, which was consistent with Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">1D</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>.

As expected, PAR increased as the drought stress intensified and then decreased after rehydration, while TBR, TCR and GPAR decreased as the drought stress intensified and increased after rehydration. An RGB image series for accession <italic>Maweinian</italic> at 30 min intervals is shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">2B</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the 3 shape descriptors in quantification of leaf-rolling</title><p>As discussed in the previous sections, TBR, PAR, and TCR all provided appropriate and continuous measures of leaf-rolling when plants were subjected to drought. However, PAR tended to be more robust than TBR and TCR. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, theoretically, PAR should increase while TBR and TCR decrease as drought stress intensifies. However, TBR and TCR were more susceptible to perturbation by non-drought related factors, such as wind or cultivation induced damage. For example, in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, a single leaf within the red dashed bounding rectangle became bent at day 4, probably due to mechanical damage. This reduced the size of the minimum bounding rectangle and the calculated convex hull. On the other hand, the reduction of the total projected plant area caused by leaf-rolling was relatively small. Therefore, instead of decreasing, TBR and TCR increased, in contrast to the aforementioned theoretical expectation. At day 6, the leaves started to roll, and TBR and TCR decreased as expected. However, the change rate of TBR and TCR were much smaller than PAR, indicating that PAR was more sensitive to leaf-rolling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In addition, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, compared with TBR change and TCR change, PAR change had a weaker relationship with biomass, which indicated that PAR is less related to plant size. We conclude therefore that PAR is more robust and sensitive to leaf-rolling than either TBR and TCR. For these reasons, PAR was selected as the optimal digital proxy for leaf-rolling.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of the 3 shape descriptors in quantification of leaf-rolling. <bold>(A)</bold> RGB image at day 1, day 4, and day 6 for a rice plant. <bold>(B)</bold> Values of the 3 shape descriptors at day 1, day 4, and day 6, with the percentage change in each feature provided to the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-00492-g0006"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Quantification of drought response under field conditions</title><p>To verify the ability of PAR and GPAR in quantifying drought response under field conditions, 42 accessions were cultivated in field plots and subjected to drought stress.

The same 42 rice accessions used in the field experiment (section: Quantification of Drought Response Under Field Conditions) with 4 replications were phenotyped under controlled conditions. The experimental design was the same as that described in section Experimental Design for Dynamic Quantification of Rice Drought Response Under Controlled Conditions. GPAR and PAR before and after stress were calculated and analyzed. Similarly, we first tested whether there was a significant replication effect. There were no significant differences between the 4 replicates (ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">5</xref> in Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">5</xref>). The mean of the 4 replicates for each feature was then calculated and used for subsequent analysis. There were no significant differences between drought resistant and drought sensitive accessions for GPAR and PAR before stress under controlled conditions (ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">6</xref> in Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">5</xref>). In contrast, significant differences were observed between drought resistant and drought sensitive accessions for all 4 features after stress (ANOVA, p value ranging from 4.862E-04 to 2.584E-03, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">6</xref> in Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">5</xref>).</p><p>First the change trends of GPAR and PAR both under controlled conditions and field conditions were compared. Because the rice accessions had gone through severe drought stress under controlled conditions, the time point D3 (severe drought stress) under field conditions was deemed as the corresponding time point of &#x0201c;after stress&#x0201d; under controlled conditions. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>, similar results were obtained under both controlled and field conditions. GPAR of both the drought resistant and drought sensitive accessions decreased after the drought stress. However, the decreasing amplitude of GPAR was much smaller for drought resistant accessions than drought sensitive accessions. PAR of the drought resistant accessions increased after drought stress while PAR of the drought sensitive accessions was relatively stable. Then we evaluated the correlation between feature changes under controlled conditions (represented by the suffix &#x0201c;_Control&#x0201d;) and feature changes under field conditions (represented by the suffix &#x0201c;_Field&#x0201d;). As is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">7</xref> in Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">5</xref>, feature change under field conditions exhibited a significant positive correlation with feature change under controlled conditions. In addition, to test the robustness of the correlation between controlled conditions and field conditions for GPAR change and PAR change, 40 rice accessions were randomly selected from the 42 rice accessions for the correlation analysis (10 repeated analysis). The results showed the range of r was 0.339&#x02013;0.414 for GPAR change (Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11">6</xref>) and 0.315&#x02013;0.371 for PAR change (Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12">7</xref>), respectively with all p values below 0.05. This indicated the robustness of the correlation of GPAR and PAR between controlled conditions and field conditions. We conclude, therefore, that GPAR and PAR can be extended to quantify drought response in field but the relatively low level of the correlation probably reflects root restriction in pots (Poorter et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Relevance of the drought-related features under controlled conditions and field conditions. <bold>(A)</bold> Dynamics of GPAR and PAR under controlled conditions. <bold>(B)</bold> Dynamics of GPAR and PAR under field conditions.

The PAR value of the drought group first decreased at a similar rate to the control and then increased, which indicated leaf-rolling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>). The leaf-rolling performance for the drought group varied across the different <italic>Miscanthus</italic> accessions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C,D</xref>). The leaf-rolling performance (such as initial date and variation rate of leaf rolling) may be related to the level of drought resistance. In addition, the ability of PAR to quantify leaf-rolling for maize plants was also demonstrated and a similar trend in PAR change can be obtained after drought treatment (Supplementary Presentation <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM13">8</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Quantification of leaf-rolling for 39 <italic>Miscanthus</italic> accessions at daily intervals.

Plant area, estimated from images, is considered as a proxy for biomass and plant growth, and has been adopted to evaluate and quantify the plant response to drought stress (Honsdorf et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Petrozza et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Fisher et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Malinowska et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, as organ occlusion becomes more pronounced (for instance, for many cereals including rice and wheat at the reproductive stages), the accuracy of projected plant area for estimating the biomass and plant growth decreases (Munns et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Sirault et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) applied smoothing splines to skeletonized images of transverse wheat leaf sections to quantify inter-genotypic variation for hydronastic leaf rolling in wheat. Their method was destructive and involved sampling the flag leaves, excising a 30 mm segment that needs careful orientation prior to image capture under a dissecting microscope. Although effective, this method would be difficult to scale as each observation quantifies the leaf rolling of a single leaf at a single point in time. Neilson et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) quantified the effect of leaf rolling on the diurnal variation in leaf area by imaging plants in the late afternoon (when the plants are least hydrated) and early the following morning (when hydration would be expected to be maximal). They concluded that leaf rolling caused the decrease of leaf area and the degree of leaf-rolling could be estimated by the reduction of leaf area. Their method was efficient in quantification of leaf-rolling over the diurnal cycle. However, for long term quantification with intermittent imaging, this method may lose its efficacy because the plant area increases over time as the plant grows. We present a robust image feature PAR that is largely independent of imaging frequency, as well as being platform-agnostic. The method should therefore be applicable to quantifying responses to water restriction in a broad range of cereals and related grasses, under a wide range of environments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This paper demonstrates the use of high-throughput phenotyping and image analysis to dynamically quantify rice drought response <italic>in vivo</italic> in a non-intrusive manner. We propose a simple method for continuous measurement of drought response under controlled and field conditions. Three shape descriptors, namely, TBR, PAR, and TCR, were derived from the images and their behavior is related to changes in the leaf. We also present an image-derived feature, GPAR, for quantification of stay-green ability. Results showed that these 4 drought-related features were capable of discriminating drought resistant and drought sensitive accessions and dynamically quantifying the rice drought response under controlled conditions across time (at either daily or half hourly time intervals). We compared the 3 shape descriptors and concluded that PAR was more robust and sensitive to leaf-rolling than TBR and TCR. In addition, PAR and GPAR proved to be effective in quantification of drought response in the field. Notably, there was a small but significant correlation between drought responses of different genotypes in field and in pot, as measured by these features. This indicates that pot-based experiments can indeed provide an indication of drought responses of different genotypes, even though the physiology of drought is likely to be quite different under the 2 situations. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of the algorithms to other grass species, using our approach to test archival <italic>Miscanthus</italic> data that had previously been collected on an independent platform. In conclusion, this image-based technology provides a robust platform-independent tool for quantifying drought response and should be of general utility for breeding and functional genomics in future.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>LD and WY designed the research, performed the experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
