    "The brown planthopper (BPH), an insect species that feeds on rice plants (Oryza sativa L.), is one of the most destructive insect pests of rice. BPH can be controlled with chemical pesticides, but they are expensive in terms of the cost and environmental hazards. Hence, utilization of resistance genes in resistant varieties is considered as a more economical and eco-friendly effective method for control.In this study, six dominant BPH-resistance genes (Bph3, Bph14, Bph15, Bph18, Bph20 and Bph21) were introduced into an elite indica rice cultivar Jin 23B using the marker-assisted selection (MAS) method of breeding. One line combining Bph14 and Bph15 and six single gene introgression lines were used to evaluate the gene effects based on three parameters: seedling and tillering resistance of the rice genotypes, honeydew weight, and BPH survival rate. Among all improved lines, combination of Bph14 and Bph15 had the largest effect in conferring resistance to BPH. Bioassays showed that the order of the gene effects was Bph14/Bph15 > Bph15 ≥ Bph14 ≥ Bph20 ≥ Bph21 ≥ Bph3 > Bph18 > none at the rice seedling stage. The pyramided or single-gene introgression lines showed enhanced resistance relative to the control. Furthermore, field trial data demonstrated that yields of improved Jin 23B lines were similar to the control under BPH-free field conditions.Each of the BPH resistance genes reduced BPH growth and development, and was effective at both the seedling and tillering growth stages. These lines can be used in rice hybrid and production in China."
