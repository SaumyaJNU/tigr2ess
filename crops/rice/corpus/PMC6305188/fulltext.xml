In particular, UV-B (280&#x02013;315 nm) can decrease leaf size and stem elongation, increase axillary branching and leaf thickness, and induce UV-absorbing compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">Robson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Leaf epidermal accumulation of phenolics reduces both oxidative damage and UV-B penetration to the inner photosynthetic layers (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Agati and Tattini, 2010</xref>), protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from damaging doses. These photomorphogenic responses are mediated by the activation of the UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) (<xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">Rizzini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) upon plant exposure to low or moderate UV-B (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Jenkins, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Acclimation responses to enriched UV-B conditions can affect plant performance and interactions with herbivores. UV-B exclusion and supplemental studies have shown that it can decrease preference and/or performance of herbivorous arthropods in diverse plant species (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Mazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">Rousseaux <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Caputo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Foggo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Demkura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Kuhlmann and M&#x000fc;ller, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Mewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Mazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">Zavala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). This has been partially explained by UV-B-mediated effects on constitutive plant defenses, such as increases in secondary metabolites (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Escobar-Bravo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>b</italic></xref>). In addition, UV-B has been reported to increase the density of leaf trichomes (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Barnes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), which are hairy epidermal structures involved in plant resistance to herbivory and in protection against abiotic stresses such as excess light intensity and UV (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Karabourniotis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Glas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, whether UV-mediated increases in trichome density enhances plant resistance to herbivores has not yet been tested.</p><p>Plant inducible defense responses to herbivory are also affected by UV (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Ballar&#x000e9;, 2014</xref>). These responses are mediated by the activation of the jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways, and are fine-tuned by these or other phytohormones such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Activation of the JA signaling pathway is associated with increased plant resistance to leaf-chewing, piercing&#x02013;sucking, and some phloem-feeding arthropods (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Howe and Jander, 2008</xref>). UV-B can increase constitutive (i.e. pre-herbivory) and also inducible (i.e. post-herbivory) jasmonate levels, resulting in reinforced chemical defenses (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">&#x00110;inh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Recently, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Dillon <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)</xref> reported enhanced induction of ET by combined solar UV-B and herbivory, and highlighted its possible role in soybean defenses. Less is known about the roles of SA, auxin, and ABA in UV-mediated induction of plant defenses. However, auxin and ABA are regulatory components of the UV-mediated accumulation of flavonoids in Arabidopsis and grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), respectively (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Berli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and SA levels are induced with increased UV irradiation times (<xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Mackerness <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Under natural conditions, plants are simultaneously exposed to UV-B and UV-A (315&#x02013;400 nm), both of which probably affect plant defense responses. UV-A radiation has different effects on plant physiology when compared to the more-energetic UV-B (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Morales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Escobar-Bravo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>b</italic></xref>). Furthermore, UV-A can attenuate UV-B-associated deleterious effects on the photosynthetic apparatus under conditions of low photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Adamse <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Joshi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">&#x00160;troch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) or, combined with UV-B, it can increase plant photosynthetic performance (<xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">Tsormpatsidis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite our increasing knowledge of the effects of UV-B on plant defenses against herbivorous arthropods, how different doses (A+B) modulate plant defenses against herbivory is unknown. Plant responses depend on the UV acclimation state, exposure time (long- versus short-term), radiation intensity, the PAR:UV ratio, and the plant species (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">de la Rosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Frohnmeyer and Staiger, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Jenkins, 2008</xref>). High UV-B exposure results in gene expression profiles that are markedly different from those observed in plants acclimated to low doses (<xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">Ulm <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). High UV-B fluence rates can induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause damage to DNA, proteins, membranes, and lipids (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Jenkins, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Hideg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), resulting in harmful effects on plant performance. Furthermore, while solar UV positively influences plant resistance to herbivores, this might come at the expense of reduced growth by antagonizing auxin signaling (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). These UV-mediated plant responses need to be disentangled when aiming for the efficient use of UV in crop production.</p><p>Here, we used cultivated tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) to study the effects of different UV doses (i.e. daily exposure times and irradiance intensities) and a fixed UV B:A ratio (~1:1.2) on plant resistance to Western flower thrips (<italic>Frankliniella occidentalis</italic>), an important insect pest of many vegetable and ornamental crops worldwide (<xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Steenbergen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Despite being a major crop species, the effects of UV radiation on tomato physiology and resistance to relevant biological stresses have not been investigated. Furthermore, it is not known whether UV might affect the glandular trichomes on tomato leaves, which represent an important chemical and physical barrier against herbivory (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2010<italic>b</italic></xref>). The availability of mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis or glandular trichomes makes cultivated tomato an ideal system to assess the effects of UV on plant resistance to herbivorous arthropods. We first tested the effects of different supplemental UV daily exposure times on resistance to thrips and selected the most effective dose to study the dynamics of the induced resistance. Time-course experiments were used to assess UV effects on thrips-associated damage and preference, on specific UV-absorbing compounds, on the metabolome, and on defense-related type-VI leaf glandular trichomes. We then studied the effects of two UV irradiance intensities, but with the same daily exposure times, on tomato growth and resistance, and examined the mechanism of this induction by using mutants defective in JA signaling (<italic>defenseless-1</italic>) and trichome-associate defenses (<italic>odorless-2</italic>). Further analyses of auxin, ABA, SA, and jasmonates levels, as well as the expression of defense-responsive genes, were used to determine the direct effects of UV on plant growth- and defense-related signaling pathways. Our study has significant implications for agricultural systems, as the use of artificial lighting to optimize crop yield is currently increasing in areas where light intensity is significantly reduced during the winter months (e.g. boreal and temperate climatic zones) and in greenhouses depleted of UV due to the use of non-transmitting UV materials (<xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">V&#x000e4;nninen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0088" ref-type="bibr">Wargent and Jordan, 2013</xref>). Determining how plants respond to sudden UV exposure is then crucial in the context of new lighting technologies and greenhouse-grown crops such as tomato (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Mariz-Ponte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant and insect materials</title><p>Experiments were performed using the following tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) genotypes: cv. &#x02018;Moneymaker&#x02019;, and the jasmonate-deficient mutant <italic>defenseless-1</italic> (<italic>def-1</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Lightner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Howe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and the trichome-deficient mutant <italic>odorless-2</italic> (<italic>od-2</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>) (both kindly provided by Prof. Gregg Howe, Michigan State University), as well as their wild-type, cv. &#x02018;Castlemart&#x02019;.

These results suggest the existence of specific defense-related photomorphogenic responses to different UV exposure times. Numerous studies have described the beneficial effects of solar or supplemental UV-B on plant resistance to herbivorous arthropods (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Caputo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Foggo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Mewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">&#x00110;inh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Mazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">Zavala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Dillon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), including thrips (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Mazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Demkura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports that show how different UV exposure times affect plant defenses against herbivory. Plant chemical responses to different UV-B exposure times and intensities have been described; for example, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">de la Rosa <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> reported modifications in the induction of phenolic compounds in seedlings of silver birch (<italic>Betula pendula</italic>) when exposed to different supplemental UV-B irradiation times (ranging from 36&#x02013;300 min d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p><p>Our results from time-course experiments also showed that the effects of supplemental UV (30 min d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) on plant defenses against thrips were evident only at 10 d and 14 d after the beginning of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Our targeted metabolite analyses of leaves and trichome-related tissues revealed no significant changes after UV exposure at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This was surprising, as one of the most described UV-mediated changes in plant metabolism is an increased accumulation of phenolic acids and flavonoids, such as quercetin derivatives (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">de la Rosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Barnes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which is explained by their role in plant photoprotection (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Agati <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). It should be noted that although both UV-B and -A may contribute to the accumulation of UV-absorbing compounds, UV-B plays a major role in the accumulation of flavonoids and phenolic acids (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Morales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In tomato, UV-B induces production of UV-absorbing compounds in the leaves, but these compounds have not been identified (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Barnes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Production of quercetine and kaempferol derivatives is increased by solar UV-B in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Demkura and Ballar&#x000e9;, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Morales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and also in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, together with chorogenic acid (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Demkura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">&#x00110;inh <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Hence we expected that these phenolic compounds would be responsive to UV in tomato as well. Supplemental UV promotes the production of flavonoids within 1&#x02013;5 d in Arabidopsis, with levels remaining elevated 13 d after the start of the treatment (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), and induction of phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes can be detected 12 h after exposure to solar UV (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Morales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, our sampling regime should have been able to detect similar temporal changes in phenolic concentrations of UV-treated tomato leaves. The lack of induction of chlorogenic acid and the quercetin-derivative rutin (Fig. 3A, B), the main phenolic components in tomato leaves (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Larbat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), might be explained by species-specific responses to UV, or by the differing UV doses or PAR levels used in our experiments (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;tz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). A decrease in UV-mediated induction of UV-absorbing compounds has been described under low-PAR conditions (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Cen and Bornman, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Gotz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Klem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). More recently, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Coffey <italic>et al.</italic>, (2017)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Coffey and Jansen (2018)</xref> have reported an absence of induction of UV-absorbing compounds in Arabidopsis plants grown outdoors under different UV filters. Interestingly, these experiments were performed across different seasons in a temperate climatic area, i.e. characterized by a lack of extreme temperatures and low hours of direct sunshine, resulting in low daily light integrals, as it was also the case under our experimental conditions. In addition, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Hectors <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> found no significant changes in UV-absorbing compounds in Arabidopsis plants subjected to UV-B irradiances between 0&#x02013;0.1 mW cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. We applied UV doses within that range (i.e. 0&#x02013;0.02 mW cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which might explain our results. It is also possible that UV-A might have ameliorated the effects of UV-B exposure (<xref rid="CIT0089" ref-type="bibr">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Our non-targeted metabolomics analysis by NMR further demonstrated that supplemental UV did not significantly alter the leaf chemical profile of plants at 14 d after the beginning of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). However, UV-B might have affected the abundance of other compounds, not included in our targeted chemical analysis, at earlier time points. It was also notable that the density of type-VI trichomes and production of the main volatile allelochemicals associated with them, terpenes, were not affected by supplemental UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D, E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that UV-mediated induction of tomato defenses against thrips is not associated with changes in constitutive (pre-herbivory) levels of leaf-associated phenolics or with trichome-related traits.</p><p>The fact that the UV-mediated enhancement of tomato defenses against thrips was only evident at late time points (10 d and 14 d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) might be explained either by a required minimum number of doses (i.e. days) to elicit the responses or by the different UV irradiance intensities to which the plants were exposed as they grew towards the light source. This prompted us to test whether two UV irradiance intensities with the same daily exposure times could trigger different defense responses. And indeed, our results showed that under high-UV conditions Moneymaker plants experienced a greater reduction in silver damage symptoms than under low-UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In a wider comparison of different tomato genotypes, Moneymaker and the trichome-defective mutant <italic>od-2</italic> both displayed increased resistance to thrips under high- and low-UV, whilst the jasmonate deficient mutant <italic>def-1</italic> and the wild-type of the mutants, Castlemart, did not. This experimental set-up tested whether the effect of UV on the plants responses was mediated by the activation of JA defenses or the presence/absence of functional type-VI leaf trichomes. It was notable that Castlemart plants displayed higher thrips resistance levels when compared to both <italic>def-1</italic> and <italic>od-2</italic>, and to Moneymaker. These results confirmed previous reports on the role of JA defenses against thrips in tomato (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Escobar-Bravo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>a</italic></xref>), and suggest possible diminished constitutive and/or inducible defenses against thrips in Moneymaker.</p><p>We further found that reductions in silver damage symptoms in high UV-treated Moneymaker and <italic>od-2</italic> plants was accompanied by an overall increase in JA-Ile levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), as well as by induction of JA-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>,B). UV-B has been reported to increase constitutive levels of JA-Ile in Arabidopsis, tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabaccum</italic>), rice (<italic>Oriza sativa</italic>), and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), and also to increase the levels of JA-Ile and defense-related secondary metabolites after simulated herbivory in these species, resulting in enhanced resistance to lepidopteran insects (<xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). It is known that the JA signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in tomato defenses against thrips (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Escobar-Bravo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>a</italic></xref>) and therefore UV-mediated reinforcement of these defenses might explain the increased resistance that we observed. In particular, increased activity of proteinase inhibitors, which are JA-responsive defense proteins involved in plant resistance to arthropod herbivores (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Farmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>), might have negatively affected thrips feeding and performance (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Outchkourov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). UV-mediated increases in jasmonate levels might also have strengthen inducible defense responses in tomato after thrips infestation, i.e. through priming mechanisms (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Medina <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), but this needs further investigation.</p><p>Our analyses also showed increased levels of SA under high-UV conditions in Moneymaker, Castlemart, and <italic>def-1</italic> plants, but not in <italic>od-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>);. however, expression of the SA-responsive gene <italic>PR-P6</italic> was only significantly induced in Moneymaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Induction of SA and pathogen-related (PR) proteins have been reported in response to increasing UV-B exposure times in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Surplus <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Mackerness <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), and UV-B induces SA accumulation in barley (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Bandurska and Cie&#x0015b;lak, 2013</xref>), wheat (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Kov&#x000e1;cs <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), and tobacco leaves (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Fujibe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The increases in SA and PR-proteins in Arabidopsis have been explained by the generation of ROS (<xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Surplus <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Mackerness <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), but whether a similar explanation might apply to tomato under our experimental conditions is unknown. Furthermore, we did not test whether the increased SA levels were a UV-associated stress response accompanied by increases in UV-absorbing compounds. In Arabidopsis under natural sunlight, UV-associated photomorphogenic responses controlled by the UVR8 receptor share many similarities with those related to defense and stress-related signaling, including accumulation of JA and induction of SA-related genes (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Morales <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, induction of SA signaling has been associated with increased plant susceptibility to thrips, due to its antagonistic effect on JA-induced defenses (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Leon-Reyes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In our study, however, UV-mediated induction of both the JA- and SA-signaling pathways resulted in increased tomato resistance to thrips. This absence of JA&#x02013;SA antagonistic effects might be explained by the relative plant levels of both hormones, as different JA:SA ratios can result in neutral, antagonistic, or synergistic effects (<xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Mur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Whether the induction of SA might alter tomato resistance against biotrophic pathogens that are susceptible to the activation of this signaling pathway (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) needs further research.</p><p>The phytohormones auxin and ABA can modulate the SA&#x02013;JA backbone of the plant immunity signaling network (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Pieterse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), and their concentrations might be affected by UV. Both increased ABA and reduced auxin accumulation have been observed to occur upon exposure to moderate to high UV-B levels in different species, mostly associated with UV stress-related responses (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaelewyn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here, we found that ABA and auxin levels were not altered by high-UV conditions at 28 d after the beginning of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, F). This suggests that our UV conditions did not induce stress-related responses in tomato plants, and that UV-mediated enhancement of tomato resistance to thrips might not be mediated by changes in the constitutive levels of these hormones. However, UV significantly affected some plant growth parameters, namely the number of leaves and stem length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>, B). Auxins regulate plant growth and development, including stem and petiole elongation (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Deng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">Naseem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Fluctuations in auxin levels prior to our sampling time might explain the increased stem length in UV-treated plants.</p><p>Moneymaker and the <italic>od-2</italic> mutant experienced responses to UV that were not observed in Castlemart, such as increased resistance to thrips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and enhanced expression of JA-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, B). Deficiencies in different aspects of trichome-related traits might have potentiated their sensitivity/responses to UV. Plant leaf hairs can protect underlying photosynthetic tissues against UV radiation by reflecting both it and longer-wavelength radiation, and their absence or removal increases plant sensitivity to UV (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Karabourniotis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Keiller, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Manetas, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The density of type-VI trichomes was lower in Moneymaker than in Castlemart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>), which might result in reduced production of trichome-associated allelochemicals, which are positively correlated with trichome density (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Escobar-Bravo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>a</italic></xref>). In <italic>od-2</italic>, the trichome density was not reduced in comparison to the Castlemart wild-type, but a strong reduction in the type-VI trichome-derived allelochemicals terpenes and flavonoids has been reported for this genotype (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010<italic>a</italic></xref>). Although the specific role of type-VI trichome-derived flavonoids in tomato photoprotection has not been studied, a reduced accumulation of this compound in Moneymaker and <italic>od-2</italic> might have increased the penetration of UV radiation into the underlying plant tissues.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that both short daily exposure times and specific intensities of UV radiation can increase tomato resistance to thrips herbivory, probably via the reinforcement of JA defenses. They might also counterbalance the reported negative effects of UV-B on plant growth that produce dwarf phenotypes (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Ballar&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), although this requires additional research. Our results have important implications for agriculture, as the use of supplemental UV radiation can enhance crop protection against pests and thus might reduce the need for pesticides.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s25"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
