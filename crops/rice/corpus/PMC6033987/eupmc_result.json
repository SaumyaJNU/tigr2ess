    "The impacts of rice varieties with stacked drought tolerance and insect resistance on soil microbiomes are poorly understood. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects resulting from the cultivation of the drought-tolerant and insect-resistant rice cultivar, Hanhui3T, on soil physical-chemical properties, and bacterial and fungal community composition. Soil samples of Hanhui3T and conventional rice varieties (Hanhui3 and Zhonghua11) were collected in triplicate at the booting stage, and bacterial and fungal population sizes and community structures were assessed using qPCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The Bt protein concentration of Hanhui3T was significantly higher than that of Hanhui3 and Zhonghua11, while the pH of Hanhui3T was significantly lower. Bacterial population sizes and community composition were significantly different between Hanhui3T and Hanhui3 (or Zhonghua11), while no similar effects were observed for fungal communities. These differences suggest that the effect of Hanhui3T cultivation on bacterial community composition is stronger than the effect on fungal communities. Moreover, bacterial abundance was positively correlated to soil pH, while bacterial community structure variations were mainly driven by soil pH and Bt protein concentration differences. In conclusion, the abundances and structure of bacterial communities were altered in rhizosphere with Hanhui3T cultivation that changed soil pH and Bt protein concentrations, while fungal communities displayed no such responsiveness."
