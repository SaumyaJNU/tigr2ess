Loss of function of these membrane vesicular trafficking factors results in the initial secretion of storage proteins and later their partial engulfment by the plasma membrane to form an extracellular paramural body (PMB), an aborted endosome complex. Here, we show that in the rice Rab5-GEF mutant <italic>glup6</italic>, glutelin RNAs are specifically mislocalized from their normal location on the cisternal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the protein body-ER, and are also apparently translocated to the PMBs. We substantiated the association of mRNAs with this aborted endosome complex by RNA-seq of PMBs purified by flow cytometry. Two PMB-associated groups of RNA were readily resolved: those that were specifically enriched in this aborted complex and those that were highly expressed in the cytoplasm. Examination of the PMB-enriched RNAs indicated that they were not a random sampling of the <italic>glup6</italic> transcriptome but, instead, encompassed only a few functional mRNA classes. Although specific autophagy is also an alternative mechanism, our results support the view that RNA localization may co-opt membrane vesicular trafficking, and that many RNAs that share function or intracellular location are co-transported in developing rice seeds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA localization</kwd><kwd>RNA transport</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic></kwd><kwd>storage proteins</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001691</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1444610</award-id><award-id>IOS-1701061</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institute of Food and Agriculture</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100005825</named-content></funding-source><award-id>0590</award-id><award-id>0119</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA localization is a ubiquitous and effective strategy employed by micro-organisms, animal, and plant cells in sorting proteins to specific intracellular locations (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Chin and L&#x000e9;cuyer, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Eliscovich and Singer, 2017</xref>). Such a strategy is employed in developing rice seeds, where mRNAs for the major storage proteins prolamine and glutelin are targeted to specific subdomains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the bulky seed endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Okita, 2014</xref>). Prolamine RNAs are localized to the protein body-ER (PB-ER) that delimits the prolamine intracisternal granules, while glutelin RNAs are distributed to the adjoining cisternal-ER (C-ER) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Choi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<italic>b</italic></xref>). The asymmetric distribution of these storage protein mRNAs facilitates the sorting of the coded protein products (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Washida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Prolamine polypeptides are retained in the ER lumen while glutelin polypeptides are exported from the ER to the Golgi where they are subsequently transported to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs).</p><p>The transport and localization of the storage protein RNAs to the ER subdomains requires specific cis-sequences (zipcodes) located in the coding sequence and 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Hamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Washida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) that are recognized by trans-factors composed of RNA-binding protein complexes (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Crofts <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Combination of these zipcodes shows that the glutelin RNA transport pathway is dominant over the prolamine RNA transport pathway, which in turn is dominate over a constitutive pathway (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Hamada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<italic>a</italic></xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Washida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Although the three pathways are hierarchal, genetic studies have indicated they are inter-related in that they share common trans-factors (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Crofts <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Okita, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the cis-determinants and several associated RNA-binding proteins have been identified, how the RNAs are transported and targeted to specific locations remains largely undefined. Genetic studies have inferred the involvement of membrane vesicular trafficking in the transport and localization of not only storage proteins to the PSVs but also in the localization of their RNAs (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The GTPase Rab5 and its related guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rab5-GEF are required for membrane trafficking from the plasma membrane (endocytosis) and between the Golgi apparatus and PSVs (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In <italic>glup4</italic> and <italic>glup6</italic> (<italic>glutelin precursor</italic>) mutant lines, proglutelins and &#x003b1;-globulins are secreted to the extracellular space and deposited as small, electron-dense granules during early endosperm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These granules are subsequently deposited in the space between the invaginating plasma membrane and the cell wall to form novel paramural bodies (PMBs). Although initially formed by aborted endocytosis of secreted electron-dense granules containing glutelins and globulins, PMBs grow by the apparent direct secretion of endosomal components, including the ER lumenal chaperones BiP and PDI, and membrane-marker proteins for the Golgi, pre-vacuolar compartments (PVCs), and PSVs as well as &#x003b2;-glucan (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hence, the loss of Rab5 and Rab5-GEF disrupts normal membrane vesicular transport from the ER and Golgi. . In addition to disrupting intracellular trafficking of the protein cargo, RNA localization patterns are also partially altered. Although prolamine and globulin RNAs are correctly targeted to the PB-ER, glutelins RNAs are mislocalized to the PB-ER instead of the C-ER in <italic>glup4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, glutelin RNAs are also evident in the PMBs as determined by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR of developing endosperm sections, suggesting that they are transported extracellularly to these novel structures.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic model showing glutelin mRNA and protein transport in wild-type (WT) and <italic>glup6</italic> mutant rice endosperm. In WT endosperm cells (top), glutelin mRNAs are exported from the nucleus (N) and transported to the cisternal ER (C-ER; shown in green). Following translation, the resulting proglutelins are then exported via the Golgi (G) and pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) to protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) where they are proteolytically processed to acidic and basic subunits and accumulated (shown in green). In contrast, globulin mRNAs, such as prolamine mRNAs, are targeted to the protein body-ER (PB-ER) and, following export, accumulate at the periphery of the PSVs (shown in purple). Prolamine polypeptides remain in the PB-ER lumen as spherical inclusion granules. In <italic>glup6</italic> (and <italic>glup4</italic>) mutant endosperm cells (bottom), glutelin mRNAs (shown in green) are mislocalized from the C-ER to the PB-ER, whilst prolamine and globulin mRNAs remain correctly localized to PB-ER as in the wild-type. Following export from the ER via the Golgi, both globulin and proglutelin are secreted as small, electron-dense granules to the extracellular space These granules are then partially endocytosed to form novel paramural bodies (PMBs). At subsequent stages, glutelin and globulin are directly transported to the PMBs, together with lumenal chaperones and membrane markers for the Golgi, PVCs, and PSV, as well as &#x003b2;-glucan. <italic>In situ</italic> RT-PCR studies of seed sections and RNA-seq analysis of purified PMBs indicate the presence of RNAs that are either specifically enriched on this sub-compartment or are highly expressed, such as those for glutelin.

These contain a mutation in Golgi transport 1 (GOT1B), a membrane protein that mediates transport between the ER and Golgi. Unlike <italic>glup4</italic>, which mislocalizes glutelin RNAs from the C-ER to the PB-ER, in <italic>glup2</italic> prolamine and globulin RNAs are displaced from the PB-ER to the C-ER.</p><p>The mislocalization of storage protein mRNAs in rice lines expressing defective Rab5 and GOT1B suggests that the process of RNA localization is dependent on membrane vesicle trafficking (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Tian and Okita, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that, similar to <italic>glup4</italic>, glutelin RNAs are also partially mislocalized to the PB-ER in <italic>glup6</italic>. To directly determine whether PMBs contained RNAs, the aborted endosome complexes were purified by fluorescence-activated particle-sorting by exploiting the selective staining of PMBs with the vital stain fluorescein. Subsequent RNA-seq analysis showed that PMBs possessed two broad classes of mRNAs: those that were specifically enriched with this novel structure and those that were present as minor components compared to their abundant amounts in the cytoplasm. The composition of enriched mRNAs was conspicuously non-random, with the majority resolving into a few functional classes. Our results demonstrate that RNAs that code for functionally related proteins are co-transported to the extracellular PMBs and suggest that this occurs by co-opting membrane vesicular trafficking in developing rice endosperm cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant growth and selection of mutants</title><p>The rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) <italic>glup6</italic> mutant alleles EM939 and EM1327 were used for RNAseq analysis of purified PMBs and microscopy studies, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kumamaru <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min, resuspended in DEPC-treated water, and then precipitated in the presence of 0.3 M NaOAC (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and centrifuged at 4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. The RNA pellet was washed in 70% ethanol after discarding the supernatant and, after air-drying, was then dissolved in 10 &#x003bc;l DEPC-treated water. A 10-ng sample of total RNA was subjected to double-strand cDNA amplification. The cDNA library was loaded on a HiSeq 2000 instrument and paired-end sequencing with 100 base reads was performed. The processing of fluorescent images into sequences, base-calling, and quality value calculations were performed using the Illumina data processing pipeline (version 1.8). Read sequences were aligned and mapped to the MSU v.7.0 cDNA reference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/</ext-link>; accessed 22 August 2018) using CLC Genomics Workbench (v.5.05; Qiagen). To profile transcript expression levels for each mapped gene, RPKM was calculated for the exons of the transcripts in the respective MSU v.7.0 annotation. We only selected valuable transcript species for which cDNA species possessed an RPKM value &#x02265;1 in both wild-type and sorted samples.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>

This mutant line, defective in the Rab5-dependent GEF, over-accumulated the 57-kD proglutelin precursor due to a defect in its transport to the protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), where it would normally be processed to acidic and basic subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Instead, a significant amount of the synthesized proglutelin was transported to the plasma membrane where it was secreted and then subsequently partially taken up by an aborted endocytosis process to form paramural bodies (PMBs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>). Subsequent growth of the PMBs apparently occurs by direct extracellular translocation and deposition of proglutelin and &#x003b1;-globulin storage proteins to them (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

The location in the PMBs of these endosomal marker proteins, many of them membrane proteins, indicate considerable displacement of endosomal proteins to the PMBs due to the disruption in membrane trafficking from the ER to the PSVs.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Properties of the rice <italic>glup6</italic> mutant lines.

To eliminate the possibility that this apparent localization of glutelin RNAs was an artifact caused by non-specific labeling by the fluorescently labeled nucleotide during the <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR reaction of endosperm sections, we set out to purify the PMBs. Having observed abnormally high background binding of fluorescein-labeled secondary antibodies to the PMBs, the &#x02018;sticky&#x02019; nature of these structures was exploited to allow their rapid and efficient purification by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and, in turn, to permit the identification and quantification of PMB-associated mRNA species. The starting materials chosen for this procedure were &#x02018;aleurone/subaleurone peels&#x02019; isolated from mid-developing seeds of both the wild-type (TC65) and <italic>glup6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). These seed peels included the tegmentum, a single aleurone cell layer, and 3&#x02013;5 subaleurone cell layers of the bulky endosperm. The subaleurone layers were highly enriched in PMBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) due to elevated storage-protein expression in these outer endosperm cell layers. A four-step procedure was thus established in which seed peels were incubated with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody, washed to reduce background signal, sonicated to release the labeled PMBs, and then subjected to fluorescence-activated particle-sorting (FAPS) to enrich for particles by size and fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast to material derived from <italic>glup6</italic> in which PMBs could be readily stained and sorted by fluorescence intensity and particle size, very little fluorescence was observed or collected by FAPS using wild-type material, clearly demonstrating the validity of this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The purification of PMBs by FAPS was verified by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

Based on these criteria, the differentially expressed PMB transcriptome contained 1245 RNAs, the majority consisting of expressed proteins (446), hypothetical proteins (149), retrotransposons (331), and transposons (149) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The remaining 170 RNA sequences were clearly non-random and coded for proteins involved in specific cellular functions (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>, <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The two largest classes were energy-related; one for chloroplast photosynthesis (27) and the other for mitochondrial respiration (21). The photosynthesis class contained subunit sequences for both photosystems (PS) I and II. RNAs coding for the PSI apparatus were those for the iron-sulfur center (3), P700 chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> aproprotein (4), and two PSI assembly proteins, ycf3 and ycf4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Additional RNAs coding for PSII proteins included cytochrome b559 (2 genes), D1 and D2 proteins, P680 chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> apoprotein (4 genes), and reaction the center proteins psbC and psbK. Four PMB-enriched RNAs coded for proteins that transfer electrons from PSII to PSI. These included those for the cytochrome b6-f complex including cytochrome b6 (3 genes) and the cytochrome b6-f complex subunit 4, and for plastocyanin.

These included the A, B, and C subunits of the F<sub>0</sub> membrane proton channel and two (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) of the five subunits of the F1 catalytic core. Two RNAs coded for proteins in cytochrome C oxidase formation and two coded for subunits of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.</p><p>Transcripts in the DNA-binding class (17) coded for proteins involved in RNA transcription and DNA replication and repair, although many RNAs in this class coded for DNA-binding proteins of unknown functions. Two RNA-binding classes were evident: one coded for ribosomal proteins associated with cytoplasmic (3), mitochondrial (4), and plastid (9) ribosomes, and the second included RNA-binding proteins. One notable RNA-binding protein RBP-D (LOC_Os06g37000) recognizes the prolamine zipcode and therefore probably participates in the transport and localization of prolamine RNAs to the PB-ER. The expression of RBP-D was only slightly activated (1.4-fold) in <italic>glup6</italic> compared to the wild-type but it was enriched more than 33-fold in the PMBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). A second RNA-recognition motif (RRM)-containing RNA-binding protein (LOC_Os03g04780) that was normally transcriptionally silent in the wild-type was also prevalent in PMBs.</p><p>Two other classes enriched on the PMBs were cell wall-related and membrane-related proteins. The cell wall-related class consisted of eight glycine-rich cell wall structural proteins, cellulose synthase-like protein, and lignin-degrading laccase-9 precursor. Six of the RNAs for glycine-rich cell wall structural proteins were activated in <italic>glup6</italic> and specifically found only in the PMBs. The membrane-related class consisted mainly of transporters for small molecules (e.g. aquaporin) or polypeptides (tat-like protein). The gene activation of cell wall- and membrane-related proteins was consistent with the significant changes at the cell surface due to the formation of PMBs.</p><p>Other RNAs coded for antimicrobial peptides (8), enzymes (6), cytoskeleton (1), protein turnover-modification (4), signal transduction (3), and a large class of miscellaneous RNAs (37). Many of the RNAs in this latter class coded for proteins with defined peptide domains (e.g. F-box domains, glycine-rich). Sixteen were transcripts for latency-associated nuclear antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Sets of RNAs present on PMBs with RPKM&#x02265;5.0</title><p>Although glutelin RNAs were conspicuously localized on the PMBs, as observed by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR, they were not enriched relative to their <italic>glup6</italic> levels. Examination of the RNA-seq data, however, indicated that eight glutelin RNAs were among the first 40 most-abundant RNAs on the PMBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Analysis of the RPKM-based PMB/wild-type ratio showed that glutelins were distributed to the PMBs mainly due to their very high expression during seed development. For example, glutelin RNA (LOC_Os01g55690) had a RPKM value of ~110 in the PMB fraction but this constituted less than 0.5% of the total expressed in the <italic>glup6</italic> transcriptome.</p><p>As PMBs appeared to contain RNAs that were abundantly expressed, we cataloged RNAs that were present on the PMBs with a RPKMvalue &#x02265;5.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). At this relative abundance, the number of RNAs associated with the PMBs was substantially lower than the PMB-enriched RNAs listed in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. This reduction was mainly due to the significantly lower number of RNAs that coded for expressed and hypothetical proteins, retrotransposons, and transposons having RPKM values &#x02265;5.0 in the PMB fraction. For example, while 331 retrotransposon RNAs were found to be enriched 5-fold or more in PMBs compared to the total <italic>glup6</italic> transcriptome (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), only 22 had RPKMs &#x02265;5.0 in the PMB fraction. The bulk of the RNAs coding for expressed and hypothetical proteins, retrotransposons, and transposons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Table S5</xref>), however, were also found to be enriched (PMB/<italic>glup6</italic>&#x02265;5.0) in the PMBs (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>).</p><p>The other major change clearly evident was the presence of storage-protein RNAs, consisting of 11 glutelin RNAs, one albumin, and one cupin. In addition, substantial quantities of 14 prolamine RNAs and one &#x003b1;-globulin were also present. RPKM values ranged from a high of &#x0003e;202 for one of the glutelin RNAs (LOC_Os02g15169) to a low of ~5 for another glutelin RNA (LOC_Os02g15070). Other significant differences are observed for ABA stress- and cell wall-related RNAs. Six prominent RNAs that coded for heat-shock proteins and other stress-related proteins had prominent RPKM values in the PMBs, although they encompassed only 1&#x02013;6% of the total transcriptome levels in <italic>glup6</italic>. No cell wall-related RNAs were present at a RPKM value &#x02265;5.0.</p><p>Other than the changes observed for the aforementioned classes of RNAs, many of the other RNA classes were relatively unaffected by the two criteria used in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. This was most conspicuous for the energy-related respiration and photosynthesis classes. Nearly all of the RNAs in these two classes were abundant and enriched in the PMBs.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Mislocalization of novel mRNA species to the PB-ER and accumulation on dilated structures</title><p>To validate the mislocalization of RNAs to the PMBs, selected RNAs were subjected to analysis by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR.

Interestingly, RNAs coding for the GTPase-activating protein were observed mainly with the PMBs, with very little located intracellularly. Unlike the other RNAs examined, the one coding for GTPase-activating protein was not associated with the PB-ER.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>Mislocalization of mRNAs encoding RBP-D, DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, RNA polymerase subunit b, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and GTPase-activating protein in the <italic>glup6</italic> mutant compared with the wild-type (WT).

Initially, cargo vesicles containing storage proteins are diverted from the storage vacuole to the plasma membrane, whereupon the storage proteins are secreted into the intercellular space. These proteins are subsequently partially engulfed by an aborted endosomal process to form a prominent extracellular PMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). PMBs also contain proteins normally located in the ER, Golgi, PVC, and PSVs. The secretion of these proteins, many of them membrane proteins, to the PMB indicates that normal membrane vesicular trafficking from the ER to the PSVs is blocked. The presence of numerous membranous electron-dense granules bordering the cytoplasmic face of the PMBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and the absence of extracellular glutelin granules in the cell wall space suggest the direct transport of membrane vesicles to the PMB surface, and subsequent accumulation of their cargo within the PMB.</p><p>Under normal conditions there is a balance between outward and inward trafficking of membrane vesicles between the ER and PSVs. An indirect consequence of outward membrane trafficking to the PMBs in <italic>glup6</italic> (as well as <italic>glup4</italic>) is the reduction in intracellular membranes. This was readily apparent for the ER, which under normal conditions was arranged in multiple layers, and ran parallel to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In <italic>glup6</italic>, the distribution of the ER was random in relation to the plasma membrane and the overall content was lower than that seen in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>). The reduction in the ER was probably the result of outward transport not being balanced by inward membrane trafficking.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that the loss-of-function of Rab5-GEF in <italic>glup6</italic> also disrupted the normal intracellular distribution of selective mRNAs in developing rice endosperm. While prolamine and globulin RNAs were correctly targeted to the PB-ER, glutelin mRNAs were mislocalized to this ER subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The normal localization of prolamine and globulin RNAs on the PB-ER indicated that the consequences of mutations in Rab5 and Rab5-GEF were selective and were not due to a total disruption of the integrity of the cortical ER.</p><p>Examination of storage-protein RNA distribution patterns indicated that glutelin RNAs were also observed associated with PMBs. Direct evidence for the presence of PMB-associated RNAs was obtained by RNA-seq analysis of PMBs purified by fluorescence-activated particle sorting. Two classes of RNAs were clearly present in the PMBs: one consisted of RNAs that were specifically enriched within the PMBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>) the second consisted of highly expressed RNAs where only a small proportion were associated with the PMBs (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Highly expressed RNAs such as those for glutelin were, in the most part, retained by the cell and only a small portion were extracellularly transported to the PMBs. These observations indicated that Rab5 and Rab5-GEF were not only required for RNA transport and localization, but that they may also have distinct roles depending on the RNA species. While glutelin RNAs were mislocalized intracellularly, RNAs enriched on the PMBs were mislocalized extracellularly.</p><p>Based on the RPKM values, two RNA sequences coded by LOC_Os09g00999 and LOC_Os09g01000 dominated the PMB transcriptome. Both aligned with the 18S and 26s rRNA sequences, suggesting that the ribosomes were a major constituent of the PMBs. The presence of ribosomes would be consistent with the transport and localization of RNAs as it is generally thought that mRNAs are transported in silenced polysome complexes. Alternatively, the presence of ribosomes may reflect autophagy, especially of rough ER-containing polysomes.</p><p>The composition of RNAs enriched on the PMBs was clearly non-random and was not simply a proportional sampling of the <italic>glup6</italic> transcriptome as RNAs that coded for specific classes of proteins were readily apparent. This was most apparent for the cell wall-related, respiration-energy, photosynthesis-energy, and ribosomal proteins classes, as well as for the miscellaneous protein class. The glycine-rich cell wall structural proteins comprised eight of the 10 RNAs in the cell wall-related class. Of the 38 RNAs in the miscellaneous class, 18 coded for &#x02018;latency-associated nuclear antigen&#x02019; and six for a glycine-rich protein. RNA sequences of the two energy classes were also biased. In the respiration class, 13 RNAs coded for proteins involved in the F<sub>1</sub> or F<sub>0</sub> subunits of ATP synthase, two for cytochrome c oxidase, and two for NADH-ubiquinone oxido-reductase. Other than two RNAs coding for the Rubisco large subunit, all of the 31 remaining RNAs coded for subunits of PSI, PSII, or intermediates between these two photosystems (cytochrome b6 and plastocyanin), and for terminal NADPH-oxidoreductase.</p><p>The composition of the highly selective RNAs enriched on the PMBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">S6</xref>) was not due to their specific expression levels in <italic>glup6</italic> compared to the wild-type. While there were RNAs that were not transcribed in wild-type developing seeds but activated in <italic>glup6</italic>, others showed relatively minor changes in gene expression compared with the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Likewise, the enrichment of these RNAs on the PMBs was not a product of chromosome location. While six of the glycine-rich cell wall-related proteins were clustered on chromosome 10, two other genes resided on chromosomes 6 and 11. Similarly, the locations of genes for ATP synthase were distributed on chromosomes 1, 4, 10, and 12. The presence of RNAs that coded for proteins involved in specific processes such as respiration or photosynthesis was consistent with the &#x02018;regulon&#x02019; hypothesis (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Keene, 2014</xref>) where sets of RNAs that share similar functions and/or intracellular locations are co-transported.</p><p>The activation of gene expression for proteins of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain inferred the need for energy production to support membrane trafficking. A greater requirement for energy was consistent with the increased membrane trafficking in <italic>glup6</italic> compared to the wild-type. The growth of the PMBs during seed development indicated that membrane vesicles were accumulated at this site and not recycled, necessitating the need for the biogenesis of new membrane, and hence ATP. In developing barley grains, oxygen gradients are readily apparent where oxygen levels are nearly depleted in the interior of the endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Rolletschek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the outer green pericarp tissue of developing grains is utilized by respiration to release the energy required for storage-protein synthesis.</p><p>Similar to what was observed for glutelin, the RNAs for RBP-D, DEAD-box RNA helicase, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme were mislocalized to the PB-ER. Their mislocalization from the C-ER to the PB-ER in <italic>glup6</italic> suggested that they were transported by processes that shared many factors of the glutelin RNA transport pathway. Although all were secreted to the PMBs, the specificity of transfer as assessed by the RPKM-based PMB/<italic>glup6</italic> ratio varied from a high of 33-fold for RBP-D to a low of 0.04-fold for DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase, suggesting that these RNAs were transported by distinct pathways that were dependent on Rab5 and GEF. Likewise, the absence of an RNA encoding GTPase-activating protein on the PB-ER in <italic>glup6</italic> suggested that it used a different transport pathway to that taken by the others, e.g. a constitutive pathway.</p><p>The mislocalization of storage-protein RNAs mediated by defective Rab5a (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), Rab5a-GEF, and Got1B (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and the transport of mRNAs to the extracellular PMBs is consistent with RNA localization co-opting membrane trafficking events. While a close association between these processes has been suggested in metazoans (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Gerst, 2008</xref>), substantial evidence for membrane-mediated RNA transport has been obtained in fungi and budding yeast cells (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Schmid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kraut-Cohen and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Hermesh and Jansen, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Haag <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Niessing <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). In budding yeast, a subset of RNAs is co-transported with ER tubule membranes to the cortical region of the incipient daughter cells during the early phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aronov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Fundakowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). A major factor in this ER-membrane association of mRNAs is She2p, which has dual RNA and ER membrane-binding properties. A second mechanism of co-transport of mRNAs with ER tubules occurs during pheromone signaling (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Gelin-Licht <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Instead of She2p, this process requires Scp160p, a 140-kDa protein with multi-K homology RNA-binding domains (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Frey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, RNAs are distributed throughout the growing hyphae on Rab5-associated early endosomes and are transported on microtubules (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;nig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baumann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Many of the players involved in this microtubule-based transport system have been identified including the endosome protein Upa1, which interacts with two RNA-binding proteins, Rrm4 and Pab1 (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Pohlmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>An alternative mechanism for the delivery of mRNAs to the PMBs is by autophagy, especially ER-phagy. The loss of Rab5a activity would essentially prevent outward transport of membrane recycling from the plasma membrane, producing a significant imbalance in endomembranes and membrane-trafficking factors. In response to this stress, ER-phagy may be induced where subdomains of the C-ER form ER-phagosomes. Since the PMBs contain resident proteins of the ER, Golgi, prevacuolar compartment, and PSVs, they also probably contain lytic vacuole proteins as well. Instead of being delivered to the lytic vacuole, the ER-phagosome may be engulfed by the PMBs. The autophagic delivery of selective subdomains of the C-ER to the PMBs could account for the biased accumulation of sets of mRNAs in the PMBs if selective ER subdomains are prone to autophagy.</p><p>The increase in transcriptional activity in the <italic>glup6</italic> mutants compared to the wild-type (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was consistent with the significant changes that occurred at the cellular level. Elevated transcription of ABA/stress-related proteins, transcriptional factors, membrane proteins (mainly transporters), enzymes, and signal transduction components suggested that despite the significant disruption in membrane trafficking, the developing seed attempted to maintain homeostasis by activating transcription.</p><p>One apparent anomaly was the distribution of prolamine RNAs based on RNA-seq data of PMBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Table S7</xref>, storage proteins). Ten prolamine RNAs had RPKM values &#x02265;5.0, ranging from 6.0 for LOC_Os06g31070.1 to &#x0003e;73 for LOC_Os07g10580.1. Moreover, &#x003b1;-globulin RNA was also found in RNA isolated from PMBs. As <italic>in situ</italic>-RT-PCR analysis clearly showed that the major prolamine and &#x003b1;-globulin RNAs were distributed to their usual location on the PB-ER in <italic>glup6</italic> (as well as <italic>glup4</italic>) and were not present on the PMBs, the presence of these storage-protein RNAs was probably an artifact of PMB purification. One plausible explanation is that the partially intact prolamine PBs, which contained peripherally bound prolamine and &#x003b1;-globulin RNAs, become associated with PMBs during their purification due to the hydrophobic nature of the exposed prolamine polypeptides. Whatever the explanation, our microscopic studies of rice endosperm sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) showed that prolamine and &#x003b1;-globulin RNAs were only found on the PB-ER, their normal location, in <italic>glup6</italic> as well as <italic>glup4</italic>.</p><p>In view of their close biochemical relationship, loss of Rab5 and GEF activities would be expected to result in similar, if not identical changes in gene expression. In order to assess the degree of overlap between differentially regulated transcripts in developing seeds of <italic>glup6</italic> and <italic>glup4</italic>, the relevant subset of RPKM values from the <italic>glup6</italic> transcriptome analysis were compared with the fold-changes observed for differentially expressed genes identified in a previous microarray-based analysis of <italic>glup4</italic> developing seeds (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Doroshenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In the <italic>glup4</italic> study, a total of 34 genes exhibited a 2-fold or greater increase in expression compared to the wild-type. Of these, 27 genes were also up-regulated (&#x02265;2.0) in <italic>glup6</italic> seeds based on their RPKM values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup7">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). In contrast, there was essentially no correlation between the nine down-regulated genes identified in the microarray data for <italic>glup4</italic> and the RPKM values of the corresponding genes from the <italic>glup6</italic> RNA-seq analysis. Three of the down-regulated genes, LOC_Os09g39610, LOC_Os09g21500, and LOC_Os04g13364 (coding for expressed proteins) and LOC_Os12g39890 (coding for a transposon) were expressed in both <italic>glup6</italic> and the wild-type at RPKM values of &#x02264;0.1.</p><p>There are a number of possible reasons as to why there was not a greater degree of overlap between the up-regulated genes in the <italic>glup4</italic> and <italic>glup6</italic> mutants. One factor likely to be important is that microarrays typically are not able to provide an accurate measure of fold-changes, especially for low-expression genes. This limitation comes from differences in hybridization efficiency as well as differences in cross-hybridization backgrounds among millions of array probes, while RNA-seq technology produces discrete, digital sequencing read counts and can quantify expression across a larger dynamic range (&#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup> for RNA-seq versus 10<sup>3</sup> for arrays) (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm and Landry, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). It was not surprising, therefore, that the greater dynamic range of the RNA-seq method allowed a larger number of differentially regulated genes to be identified. Indeed, the greater dynamic range of RNA-seq showed that close to 4000 genes were up-regulated in <italic>glup6</italic> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) as assessed by RNA-seq compared with the 34 up-regulated genes in <italic>glup4</italic> identified by microarray analysis. It is likely that many more up-regulated genes would be identified in <italic>glup4</italic> using the greater sensitivity and dynamic range of RNA-seq.</p><p>A second, and likely compounding factor, is that rice contains a total of four Rab5 genes, two of which are conventional Rab5s (GLUP4/Rab5a and Rab5c) and two which are plant-specific (Rab5b and Rab5d), which are expressed during rice seed development. In addition, rice seeds also express two GEFs, GLUP6/GEF and Rab5-GEF2, (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Wen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It is likely that, collectively, these three additional Rab5s are better able to compensate for the lack of Rab5a (the major active isoform during seed development) in <italic>glup4</italic> than Rab5-GEF2 can compensate for the lack of GEF in <italic>glup6</italic>, thus explaining the greater number of transcriptional changes observed in the <italic>glup6</italic> mutant. Moreover, this could also be the basis for the apparent silencing of some genes (LOC_Os07g17310, B12D protein; LOC_Os03g19600, retrotransposons; and LOC_Os08g03720, transposon) that were up-regulated in <italic>glup4</italic> but silenced in <italic>glup6</italic>.</p><p>The specific roles of Rab5 and Rab5-GEF in the transport and localization of RNAs, including those for glutelin, remains to be resolved. Results from ongoing studies indicate that Rab5 interacts indirectly with RBP-P, the RNA-binding protein that recognizes and interacts with the glutelin zipcode sequences. Our current studies are now directed at resolving the nature of the multi-protein Rab5-RBP-P complex and its role in RNA transport and localization to the cisternal-ER.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s18"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1.
