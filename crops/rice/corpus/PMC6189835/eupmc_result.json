    "The transport of rice glutelin storage proteins to the storage vacuoles requires the Rab5 GTPase and its related guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rab5-GEF). Loss of function of these membrane vesicular trafficking factors results in the initial secretion of storage proteins and later their partial engulfment by the plasma membrane to form an extracellular paramural body (PMB), an aborted endosome complex. Here, we show that in the rice Rab5-GEF mutant glup6, glutelin RNAs are specifically mislocalized from their normal location on the cisternal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the protein body-ER, and are also apparently translocated to the PMBs. We substantiated the association of mRNAs with this aborted endosome complex by RNA-seq of PMBs purified by flow cytometry. Two PMB-associated groups of RNA were readily resolved: those that were specifically enriched in this aborted complex and those that were highly expressed in the cytoplasm. Examination of the PMB-enriched RNAs indicated that they were not a random sampling of the glup6 transcriptome but, instead, encompassed only a few functional mRNA classes. Although specific autophagy is also an alternative mechanism, our results support the view that RNA localization may co-opt membrane vesicular trafficking, and that many RNAs that share function or intracellular location are co-transported in developing rice seeds."
