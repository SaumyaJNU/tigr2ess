    "Acetolactate synthase (ALS) catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, and is highly conserved from bacteria to higher plants. ALS is encoded by a single copy gene in rice genome and is a target enzyme of several classes of herbicides. Although ALS mutations conferring herbicide-resistance property to plants are well documented, effect of Imazamox (IMZ) on rice and the mutations in ALS correlated with IMZ tolerance were unclear. In this article, the effect of IMZ on rice calli and seedlings in tissue culture conditions were evaluated. Also, the ALSA96V mutation was confirmed to improve IMZ tolerance of rice calli. Based on these results, ALS-assisted multiplex targeted base editing in rice was demonstrated in combination with Target-AID, a CRISPR/Cas9-cytidine deaminase fusion system [1], [2]."
