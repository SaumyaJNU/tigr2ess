    "In this study we identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and sequence characteristic amplification region (SCAR) markers for specific identification of antler-shaped Ganoderma lucidum strains. When the partial mitochondrial SSU rDNA gene sequence of various antler- and kidney-shaped G. lucidum strains were analyzed and aligned, an SNP was found only in the antler-shaped G. lucidum strain at position 456 bp. In addition, this SNP of antler-shaped strains was digested by HinfI restriction enzyme. We further analyzed the polymorphism of various G. lucidum strains by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. In RAPD analysis, we isolated and sequenced a fragment, specific for antler-shaped G. lucidum strains. Based on this specific fragment sequence, two sets of specific primer pairs for antler-shaped G. lucidum strains were designed. PCR analysis revealed that two specific bands were observed only from antler-shaped strains. These two molecular markers will be helpful for identification of morphological characteristics of G. lucidum."
