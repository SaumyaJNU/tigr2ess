    "Recombinant proteins are produced for various applications in laboratory and industrial settings. Among them, therapeutic applications have evolved into a mature field in recent years, affecting the face of contemporary medical treatment. This, in turn, has stimulated an ever-greater need for innovative technologies for the description, expression, and purification of recombinant protein biopharmaceuticals. Therefore, many biopharmaceuticals are synthesized in heterologous systems to obtain satisfactory yields that cannot be provided by natural sources. As more than 35 years has passed since the first recombinant biopharmaceutical (human insulin) successfully completed clinical trials in humans, we provide a brief review of the available prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, listing the advantages and disadvantages of their use. Some examples of therapeutic proteins expressed in heterologous hosts are also provided. Moreover, technologies for the universal extraction of protein molecules are mentioned here, as is the methodology of their purification."
