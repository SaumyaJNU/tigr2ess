Many aspects of viral evolutionary rates are heterogeneous, including substitution rate differences between genes. However, the evolutionary dynamics of this viral gene rate heterogeneity (GRH) have been rarely examined. Characterizing such GRH may help to elucidate viral adaptive evolution. In this study, based on robust phylogenetic analysis, we determined an ancient endogenous PRV group in <italic>Oryza</italic> genomes in the range of being 2.41&#x02013;15.00&#x000a0;Myr old. We subsequently used this ancient endogenous PRV group and three younger groups to estimate the GRH of PRVs. Long-term substitution rates for the most conserved gene and a divergent gene were 2.69&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 8.07&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and 4.72&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 1.42&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> substitutions/site/year, respectively. On the basis of a direct comparison, a long-term GRH of 1.83-fold was identified between these two genes, which is unexpectedly low and lower than the short-term GRH (&#x0003e;3.40-fold) of PRVs calculated using published data. The lower long-term GRH of PRVs was due to the slightly faster rate decay of divergent genes than of conserved genes during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, we quantified for the first time the long-term GRH of viral genes using paleovirological analyses, and proposed that the GRH of PRVs might be heterogeneous on time scales (time-dependent GRH). Our findings provide special insights into viral gene macroevolution and should encourage a more detailed examination of the viral GRH.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>genomic fossil</kwd><kwd>paleovirology</kwd><kwd>endogenous pararetrovirus</kwd><kwd>viral gene macroevolution</kwd><kwd>rate heterogeneity</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">the China Scholarship Council</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">the International Rice Research Institute</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">the National Institute of Genetics under the auspices of the National Bioresource Project of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in eukaryotic genomes have arisen from the vertical inheritance of viral sequences that have occasionally been integrated into host germline genomes (<xref rid="evy207-B15" ref-type="bibr">Feschotte and Gilbert 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015a</xref>). Although natural virus fossils are unavailable, EVEs can serve as genomic fossils of ancient exogenous viruses (<xref rid="evy207-B16" ref-type="bibr">Feschotte and Gilbert 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B33" ref-type="bibr">Katzourakis 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Kishima 2016</xref>). The mining and analysis of EVEs has had an important impact on the emerging field of paleovirology, with implications for the characterization of viral origins and evolution as well as host&#x02013;virus and virus&#x02013;virus coevolution (<xref rid="evy207-B43" ref-type="bibr">Patel et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B15" ref-type="bibr">Feschotte and Gilbert 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>Viral evolutionary rates are heterogeneous in many respects, including across virus groups and time scales (<xref rid="evy207-B13" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B12" ref-type="bibr">Duch&#x000ea;ne et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B3" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2016</xref>). Most viral genomes comprise multiple genes exhibiting different degrees of sequence conservation or evolutionary divergence, which indicates an evolutionary rate heterogeneity between different viral genes (gene rate heterogeneity, GRH). This viral GRH is a consequence of the diverse evolutionary forces and selection pressures imposed on different viral genes. In particular, some core viral genes, such as those encoding reverse transcriptases (RTs) (<xref rid="evy207-B57" ref-type="bibr">Xiong and Eickbush 1990</xref>), are highly conserved. Such conserved genes with core functions related to viral replication evolve under high functional constraints (<xref rid="evy207-B42" ref-type="bibr">Miyata et&#x000a0;al. 1980</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B15" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Wu 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B34" ref-type="bibr">Knipe and Howley 2013</xref>). Many viral genomes encode one or more additional genes that are often highly divergent and have no obvious homology to other known genes (species/genus-specific). These divergent genes reportedly increase viral adaptation and fitness to hosts or vectors and evolve with high adaptive plasticity (<xref rid="evy207-B42" ref-type="bibr">Miyata et&#x000a0;al. 1980</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B15" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Wu 2003</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B34" ref-type="bibr">Knipe and Howley 2013</xref>). Although conserved genes obviously evolve more slowly than divergent genes, GRH in a viral genome has not been examined on a long-term scale and thus cannot presently be compared with short-term GRH. EVEs have recently been applied for estimating viral long-term substitution rates (<xref rid="evy207-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Feschotte 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lefeuvre et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B51" ref-type="bibr">Suh et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>), which, together with many other findings, has drawn attention to the time-dependent rate phenomenon of viruses (viral rate heterogeneity on time scales) (<xref rid="evy207-B19" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B56" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B12" ref-type="bibr">Duch&#x000ea;ne et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B3" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015</xref>b, <xref rid="evy207-B2" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B39" ref-type="bibr">Lin et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). Suitable EVEs can also be used to estimate the unknown long-term GRH of exogenous viruses, which may help to clarify viral adaptive evolution.</p><p>Plant pararetroviruses (PRVs) comprising the family <italic>Caulimoviridae</italic> are reverse-transcribing, double-stranded DNA viruses (<xref rid="evy207-B54" ref-type="bibr">Temin 1985</xref>) that represent a serious threat to global plant health and production. For example, the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) infecting rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) is mainly responsible for rice tungro disease, which has considerably affected rice production in South and Southeast Asia (<xref rid="evy207-B31" ref-type="bibr">Hull 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B4" ref-type="bibr">Azzam and Chancellor 2002</xref>). All known extant PRVs contain four conserved genes that encode a movement protein (MP), a capsid protein (CP), a protease (PR), and an RT with RNase H activity (RT/RH), all within a single long open reading frame (ORF) (e.g., RTBV) or multiple short ORFs (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV) (<xref rid="evy207-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hohn and Rothnie 2013</xref>). PRVs often also include various relatively divergent genes that may influence multiple processes, including vector transmission and immune suppression (<xref rid="evy207-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hohn 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B32" ref-type="bibr">Hull 2014</xref>). Although lacking an integrase and a process for integration, PRVs possess EVEs known as endogenous PRVs that originated from nonhomologous end-joining between PRVs and host genomes (<xref rid="evy207-B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). As the most abundant known EVEs in plant genomes (<xref rid="evy207-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hohn et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B18" ref-type="bibr">Geering et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B11" ref-type="bibr">Diop et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B21" ref-type="bibr">Gong and Han 2018</xref>), endogenous PRVs may enable the study of long-term GRH in viruses.</p><p>Molecular dating of EVEs (i.e., determination of the endogenization time of an EVE in host genomes) underlies many aspects of EVE-assisted viral macroevolution studies. Robust dating of endogenous PRVs can be achieved by analyzing orthologs using a series of related host species with a known phylogeny (<xref rid="evy207-B15" ref-type="bibr">Feschotte and Gilbert 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Kishima 2016</xref>). The endogenous RTBV-like (eRTBVL) family, which is an endogenous PRV family similar to RTBV, has been identified in rice genomes (<xref rid="evy207-B36" ref-type="bibr">Kunii et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). As endogenous PRVs that are not reactivated after endogenization, eRTBVLs are a good model system for investigating PRV paleovirology (<xref rid="evy207-B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Kishima 2016</xref>). The most ancient eRTBVL group is eRTBVL-D, which was endogenized long before the speciation of rice (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). In this study, we obtained precise molecular dates for eRTBVL-D segments and used them to estimate long-term nucleotide substitution rates for PRV genes. Rate comparisons revealed that the long-term GRH between the most conserved PRV gene and a divergent gene corresponded to an almost 1.83-fold difference in substitution rates, which is lower than that observed for short-term GRH according to published data. Different viral genes exhibit heterogeneity regarding evolutionary rates. We identified in this study focusing on long-term evolutionary scales an additional time dependent-factor influencing diversity of viral GRH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Genomic Screening of eRTBVL-D Segments</title><p>The systematic screening of eRTBVL-D segments involved an initial BLASTn search of the <italic>O. sativa japonica</italic> genome with the BLAST+ 2.2.27 tool (<xref rid="evy207-B6" ref-type="bibr">Camacho 2009</xref>), with six previously identified segments as queries (<xref rid="evy207-B40" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).

We also performed a tBLASTn search using the translated protein sequences of the eRTBVL groups, and additional eRTBVL-D segments &#x0003e;100&#x02009;bp were not detected. In case some genomic loci contained multiple eRTBVL-D segments (one segment next to or near another segment), potentially with independent origins or rearrangement events, individual segments were detected based on analyses of viral genomic structure and synteny of integration sites (see the following Genome-Wide Orthology Analysis section).

Given this assumption, the distance between eRTBVL-D sequences and the viral sequences of eRTBVL-A/-B/-C (consensus sequences) could be divided into the following two components: variations between viral sequences of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C, and mutations of eRTBVL-D sequences accumulated in the host genome since endogenization. Consequently, we first calculated pairwise distances (uncorrected distances) between eRTBVL-D sequences in the <italic>O. sativa japonica</italic> genome and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C consensus sequences. The pairwise distances were then corrected by subtracting the distance corresponding to the number of accumulated mutations in host genomes since eRTBVL-D endogenization (2.41&#x02013;6.76&#x000a0;Myr for the examined segments). The accumulated distances of eRTBVL-D segments in rice genomes were estimated as half the distance between orthologous <italic>O. sativa japonica</italic>/<italic>O. meridionalis</italic> eRTBVL-D sequences (these accumulated distances are 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, 0.006 for the d3, d10, d11, and d14 segments, respectively).</p><p>Pairwise distances were calculated with MEGA version 7.0 (<xref rid="evy207-B35" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). After generating alignments in MUSCLE (<xref rid="evy207-B14" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>) followed by manual editing, the best nucleotide substitution models for each data set were determined with MEGA based on the Bayesian information criterion. TN93+G was selected as the best model for all whole-length data sets. The best models for the whole-length data sets were also selected for the data sets of the respective domains/ORFs. To verify that the previously constructed consensus sequences were good representatives of their corresponding viral genomic sequences (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), we also calculated the distances between eRTBVL-D sequences and the raw sequences of eRTBVL-A/-B/-C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). The resulting corrected distance divided by the divergence time between the viral sequences of the studied eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C segments (approximated as the difference between the ages of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C sequences [2.25&#x02013;6.75&#x000a0;Myr] when the time required for endogenization of a viral sequence inserted into a host germline genome was ignored) was equal to the substitution rate during the designated period. The GRH between two viral genes was quantified as the fold difference between their substitution rates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Segments of the eRTBVL-D Group in the Rice Genome</title><p>Systematic screening of the rice genome using known sequences revealed 15 eRTBVL-D segments &#x0003e;100&#x02009;bp (<xref rid="evy207-T1" ref-type="table">table&#x000a0;1</xref>), six of which were detected in a previous study (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).

The divergence times of <italic>Oryza</italic> species are well documented, and a very recent and comprehensive estimation based on large data sets has established the divergence times of <italic>O. meridionalis</italic>, <italic>O. punctata</italic>, and <italic>O. brachyantha</italic> as 2.41, 6.76, and 15.00&#x000a0;Ma, respectively, similar to values obtained in previous studies (<xref rid="evy207-B50" ref-type="bibr">Stein et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Thus, the oldest eRTBVL-D segments can be traced to 6.76&#x02013;15.00&#x000a0;Ma, whereas most segments are 2.41&#x02013;6.76&#x000a0;Myr old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F1">fig.&#x000a0;1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results imply that rice PRVs originated earlier than previously estimated (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Long-Term Substitution Rates of PRVs</title><p>We selected four eRTBVL-D segments (d3, d10, d11, and d14) with characteristics that made them good candidate genomic fossils for paleovirological studies (i.e., clearly defined ages, ample lengths [&#x0003e;1,772&#x02009;bp], and coverage of different viral genic regions [domains/ORFs]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F1">fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). These eRTBVL-D segments contained multiple disruptive mutations (<xref rid="evy207-T1" ref-type="table">table&#x000a0;1</xref>), suggesting the absence of selection by hosts. Different tests of neutral evolution conducted for each ortholog data set of the four eRTBVL-D loci supported the assumption that all four segments evolved neutrally in their host genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Therefore, we used the sequences of the four eRTBVL-D loci to calculate PRV long-term substitution rates.</p><p>We previously revealed that the virus of eRTBVL was an ancient sister rather than an ancestor of extant RTBV, and that consensus sequences constructed from multiple copies of the relatively young eRTBVL groups (eRTBVL-A, -B, and -C endogenized in <italic>O. sativa</italic> &#x0223c;0.01&#x02013;0.16&#x000a0;Ma) were very good representatives of the corresponding viral genomic sequences (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). A consensus sequence could not be constructed for the eRTBVL-D group because of a lack of high-quality copies. Consequently, we compared eRTBVL-D sequences with the reconstructed viral sequences of eRTBVL-A, -B, and -C for calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>A</italic>;</xref> for details, see Materials and Methods). In our calculations, we ignored the time required for a viral sequence inserted in a host germline genome to be endogenized in a host population. Although this time period is unknown, it is basically zero relative to a million years of macroevolution (2.41&#x02013;6.76&#x000a0;Myr) (<xref rid="evy207-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Feschotte 2010</xref>). Accordingly, we first calculated distances between each eRTBVL-D sequence and the consensus sequences of eRTBVL-A, -B, and -C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>A</italic></xref>), which resulted in an average uncorrected distance of 0.260 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Each of these distances was then corrected by subtracting the distance accumulated in host genomes for eRTBVL-D since endogenization, and the latter was approximated as half the distance between orthologous <italic>O. sativa japonica</italic>/<italic>O. meridionalis</italic> eRTBVL-D sequences for each examined locus. The average accumulated distance in host genomes was 0.006. Therefore, the average corrected distance between viral sequences of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C was 0.254 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>B</italic></xref>). The corrected distance approximated the accumulated virus&#x02013;virus distance resulting from the viral substitution rate during the designated time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="evy207-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Feschotte 2010</xref>). When the time required for a viral sequence inserted in a host germline genome to be endogenized was ignored, the difference between the ages of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C sequences was approximately the same as the divergence time between the viral sequences of the studied eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C segments. After dividing by this time (2.25&#x02013;6.75&#x000a0;Myr), the average lower and upper bounds of long-term substitution rates for the virus were calculated as 3.77&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> and 1.13&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> substitutions/site/year, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F2">fig.&#x000a0;2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Our calculations may have slightly overestimated the actual values because of our assumption about the duration of the endogenization process. Additionally, the virus of eRTBVL-D has been assumed to be the direct ancestor of the viruses of eRTBVL-A, -B, and -C. We cannot exclude the possibility that the virus of eRTBVL-D is an ancient sister of the viruses of eRTBVL-A/-B/-C, although they are very closely related (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Under this possibility, our calculated values would be overestimations. We did not calculate the evolutionary rates during the divergence between the viruses of eRTBVL-A, -B, and -C because of the recombination that occurred among these viruses (<xref rid="evy207-B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>).

Therefore, the divergence time between the viral sequences of the studied eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C segments was approximated as the difference between the ages of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C sequences.

Moreover, this consistency suggests that our calculations resulted in a close approximation of the substitution rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-Term GRH between Conserved and Divergent PRV Genes</title><p>ORFz, which represents a species-specific divergent gene possibly involved in vector transmission or immune suppression, was covered 4-fold by four eRTBVL-D segments (d3, d10, d11, and d14). Meanwhile, the RT/RH domain in ORFy, which represents the most conserved PRV gene responsible for reverse transcription-mediated genome replication, was covered 3-fold by these segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F1">fig.&#x000a0;1<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="evy207-B36" ref-type="bibr">Kunii et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hohn 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B32" ref-type="bibr">Hull 2014</xref>). Although the identified eRTBVL-D segments only cover about half of the whole viral genomic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F1">fig.&#x000a0;1<italic>A</italic></xref>), the coverage of the four segments at the two typical PRV genes allowed us to use them as molecular fossils to reliably examine the long-term GRH between these viral genes. Neutral evolution tests of the respective ORF/domain sequences in each examined eRTBVL-D segment confirmed that these viral gene-derived segments in host genomes have undergone neutral evolution after endogenization, making them suitable molecular fossils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). We then applied the rate calculation used for whole segment data sets to individual gene segment data sets.

The alternative relationship between the viruses of eRTBVL-D and eRTBVL-A/-B/-C mentioned earlier likely does not substantially influence this comparison. A comparison of rates calculated for the same eRTBVL-D loci (d3, d11, or d14) revealed a significant long-term GRH between the ORFz and RT/RH genes (<italic>P</italic> value = 1.95&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), which was quantified to be average of 1.83-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F3">fig.&#x000a0;3<italic>B</italic></xref>). The PR domain in ORFy, which represents another conserved gene involved in processing polyproteins to produce individual functional proteins, was mostly encompassed by the d14 segment (the endogenization time of the d15 segment was unclear) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F1">fig.&#x000a0;1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Therefore, we also determined that the long-term substitution rate of the viral PR gene was 3.99&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 1.20&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> substitutions/site/year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig.

Correspondingly, the long-term substitution rate of the ORFz gene was 1.32-fold that of the PR gene, whereas the long-term substitution rate of the latter gene was 1.44-fold that of the RT/RH gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S1</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). These data suggest that the long-term GRH between differentially conserved PRV genes is unexpectedly low. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the long-term GRH using paleovirological evidence.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary Dynamics of GRH of PRVs</title><p>Short-term substitution rates for RTBV have not been reported to date. In a previous study, ORF VI of another PRV, CaMV, was observed to have a short-term substitution rate (average of 5.81&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions/site/year; 50&#x02013;52&#x02009;years) that differed from that of the other ORFs (average of 1.71&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions/site/year for ORFs I&#x02013;V), suggesting that ORF VI is the least conserved of the confirmed ORFs of this PRV (<xref rid="evy207-B58" ref-type="bibr">Yasaka et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). This difference means that the short-term substitution rate of ORF VI is 3.40-fold that of ORFs I&#x02013;V. The gene products of ORF VI have multiple functions, and can act as host range determinants (<xref rid="evy207-B48" ref-type="bibr">Schoelz et&#x000a0;al. 1986</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B23" ref-type="bibr">Haas et&#x000a0;al. 2002</xref>). The RT/RH gene is located in ORF V of CaMV. Therefore, the short-term GRH between ORF VI and RT/RH genes is &#x0003e;3.40-fold. Additionally, ORFz of the virus of eRTBVL and ORF 4 of RTBV (the counterpart of ORFz in RTBV) are located at the same viral genomic site as ORF VI of CaMV (i.e., immediately after RT/RH domains), and are presumed to have functions similar to those of ORF VI (<xref rid="evy207-B31" ref-type="bibr">Hull 1996</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B36" ref-type="bibr">Kunii et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>). Nucleotide sequence and encoded amino acid sequence of ORFz of the virus of eRTBVL exhibit no obvious homology with the corresponding sequences of CaMV ORF VI. However, similar amino acid residues in a short key motif (TAV motif) of the ORF VI protein sequence can be recognized in the ORFz protein sequence (<xref rid="evy207-B41" ref-type="bibr">Marchler-Bauer et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>). Although short- and long-term data were not obtained for the same viral species, a comparison of their short- and long-term GRHs seems appropriate. Consequently, the long-term GRH estimated in this study may be lower than the short-term GRH, implying a decay in the long-term GRH of PRVs. Although heterogeneity exists between viral gene rates and between viral rates on different time scales, the heterogeneity between the viral GRH on different time scales was untested and unknown. On the basis of our results and previously reported data, we propose that the viral GRH may be heterogeneous on time scales (i.e., time-dependent GRH).</p><p>The rate heterogeneity on time scales (millions of years) for a virus can be up to several orders of magnitude, but the GRH heterogeneity on time scales for different viral genes is the same order of magnitude (1.8 vs 3.5). Both the short- and long-term GRHs are low, which may suggest there is a similar dichotomy between core genes and additional genes involved in the adaptation to a particular host for PRVs. We then compared the short- and long-term substitution rates of divergent and conserved PRV genes using our data as well as published data (<xref rid="evy207-B58" ref-type="bibr">Yasaka et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The ratio of short- to long-term substitution rates for a divergent gene (ORFz and counterparts) was 4.09&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> to 1.23&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>, whereas that for a conserved gene (RT/RH) was &#x0003c; 2.12&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> to &#x0003c; 6.36&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup>. Subsequently, we performed linear regression on the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed substitution rates of the two genes and the corresponding measurement time scales. We obtained slopes of &#x02212;0.79 and &#x0003e; &#x02212;0.73 for the ORFz and RT/RH genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="evy207-F3">fig.&#x000a0;3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Thus, the lower long-term GRH of PRVs was due to the relatively faster rate decay of divergent genes than of conserved genes during evolution. Consequently, in a viral genome, there is a slight difference in the rate decay speed between the conserved core genes and the divergent additional genes, although all genes exhibit a rate decay during evolution. This slight difference may be useful for further improving the precision of calculations regarding the time-dependent rate phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Drivers and Significance of the Time-Dependence of Viral GRH</title><p>There has been some uncertainty regarding whether the time-dependent rate phenomenon is an artefact and is biased because mismodeling can lead to inaccurate time-dependent rate estimates (<xref rid="evy207-B49" ref-type="bibr">Soubrier et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>). However, multiple independent observations and strict calibrations support the existence of a time-dependent rate phenomenon in nature (<xref rid="evy207-B47" ref-type="bibr">Rocha et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B5" ref-type="bibr">Burridge et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B24" ref-type="bibr">Henn et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B19" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B25" ref-type="bibr">Ho et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B12" ref-type="bibr">Duch&#x000ea;ne et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B3" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2016</xref>). Evidence from paleovirological analyses also support this phenomenon (this study, and <xref rid="evy207-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Feschotte 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B37" ref-type="bibr">Lefeuvre et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B51" ref-type="bibr">Suh et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations can accumulate rapidly during short-term evolution, but may be swept later, which may represent the biological basis for the time-dependent rate phenomenon (<xref rid="evy207-B44" ref-type="bibr">Penny 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B47" ref-type="bibr">Rocha et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>). Factors such as purifying selection, transmission bottleneck, highly subdivided population structure, and substitution saturation might act to sweep these slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations on the long-term scale (<xref rid="evy207-B26" ref-type="bibr">Ho et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="evy207-B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Feschotte 2010</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B56" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2011</xref>; <xref rid="evy207-B3" ref-type="bibr">Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2016</xref>).</p><p>The biological basis and drivers described earlier might also contribute to the time-dependent GRH proposed in this study. To explain time-dependent GRH, we need to understand the cause of a slightly faster rate decay for divergent genes than for conserved genes during evolution as concluded above. Regarding short-term scales, divergent genes exhibiting high adaptive plasticity are likely to endure more nonsynonymous mutations than genes under high functional constraints. Additionally, divergent genes endure less nonsynonymous mutations (largely swept) on long-term scales than on short-term scales. These mutations are swept in conserved genes, whereas divergent genes carry more nonsynonymous mutations even after/during sweeping. These processes are actually persistent. Strikingly, a time-dependent rate phenomenon has also been observed in some hosts (<xref rid="evy207-B25" ref-type="bibr">Ho et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). It is possible that the putative time-dependent rate phenomenon of hosts during host&#x02013;virus coevolution also contributes to the time-dependent GRH of viruses. A decay in the long-term host evolutionary rate may impose a relatively weak selection pressure on weakly conserved viral genes, thereby resulting in the decay of the long-term GRH of viruses. The relatively low long-term GRH of PRVs we observed might be associated with a stable infection and coevolution with rice hosts. Consequently, we hypothesize that the heterogeneity of GRH may be related to the fast adaptation to hosts on short-term scales, and efficient coevolution with hosts on long-term scales.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we detected and dated an ancient group of rice EVEs derived from PRVs, which enabled us to explore the long-term GRH of exogenous viruses to study their adaptive evolution. Most segments were 2.41&#x02013;6.76&#x000a0;Myr old, whereas two segments were traced back to 6.76&#x02013;15.00&#x000a0;Ma. As expected, an examination of these genomic fossils revealed heterogeneity in long-term substitution rates across different PRV genes and suggested the existence of diverse long-term selection pressures among viral genes. Unexpectedly, the long-term GRH (1.83-fold between the most conserved and divergent genes) was lower than the short-term GRH of PRVs (&#x0003e; 3.40-fold) according to published data. This observation implies that for the determination of the heterogeneity between PRV gene rates the respected time scale matters. The relatively low GRH of PRVs on long-term scales was because of a slightly faster rate decay for divergent genes than for conserved genes during evolution. This difference suggests that although viral sequences exhibit a rate decay during evolution, the speed of this decay differs slightly between the core genes and additional genes of PRVs. It is possible that the adaptive evolution of PRVs may slow down on a long-term scale.</p><p>In summary, we examined for the first time the evolutionary dynamics of the GRH of viral genes using genomic fossils. Our results suggest that the GRH of PRVs might be time-dependent, which raises an interesting question concerning GRH dynamics in other viruses, namely, whether the GRH in a viral genome is generally time-dependent. Additional and more detailed studies are required to estimate the GRH of various viral families and groups. In addition to further characterizing viral gene macroevolution, such future research may provide specific insights into the deep coevolution between hosts and viruses. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="evy207_supp.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Kanako O.
