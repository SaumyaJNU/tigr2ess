A set of 472 rice genotypes comprising landraces and breeding lines were evaluated for two seasons under field conditions with low and recommended nitrogen and &#x0003e;100 landraces were identified with relative higher yield under low nitrogen. Donors were identified for higher N uptake, N translocation into grains and grain yield under low N. Grains on secondary branches, N content in grain and yield appears to be the selection criterion under low N. Through association mapping, using minimum marker set of 50 rice SSR markers, 12 genomic regions were identified for yield and yield associated traits under low nitrogen. Four associated genomic regions on chromosomes 5, 7 and 10 were fine mapped and QTL for yield under low N were identified from the marker delimited regions. Three candidate genes viz., 2-oxoglutarate /malate translocator (Os05g0208000), alanine aminotransferase (Os07g0617800) and pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase (Os10g0189600) from QTL regions showed enhanced expression in the genotypes with promising yield under low N. Marker assisted selection using SSR markers associated with three candidate genes identified two stable breeding lines confirmed through multi-location evaluation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is cultivated in an area of 163.1 million ha with ~15% of global nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs resulting in the production of 748 million tonnes (FAO, 2016) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fertilizer.org">www.fertilizer.org</ext-link>). However, the input use efficiency of N is low with ~30&#x02013;50%, increasing the cost of cultivation and environmental pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Thus, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice becomes important through the nitrogen application management strategies as well as through the development of varieties with high NUE. Genetic variation for NUE in rice germplasm has been earlier reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Several rice genotypes were studied for yield and NUE through field evaluation and efforts were made to characterize the correlations of agro-morphological traits and parameters with yield and NUE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. NUE including N uptake, translocation, assimilation, and remobilization is inherently complex and is governed by multiple genetic and environmental factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and several quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been reported using many bi-parental populations for N metabolism and NUE in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Rice landraces adapted to the local environments and selected by the farmers for their better yield under low or zero inputs form an interesting genetic material for identification of donors and genomic regions for better NUE. Landraces, given their past evolutionary history and adaptation to stress environments, often out-yield modern cultivars under low-input production systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Association mapping based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a high-resolution method for simultaneous detection of multiple loci and their alleles associated with complex traits. LD is the non-random association of alleles at different loci, caused by the correlation between the allele polymorphisms (of markers) due to their shared history of mutation and recombination. Selection, mutation, migration, linkage and admixture increase LD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The indirect selection by farmers over time would have increased the LD of rice landraces, which can be exploited for association mapping. Using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, several agronomically important traits including NUE have been identified through association mapping in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Recently, Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) has become a powerful tool in rice to identify genomic regions associated with traits of interest using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Since, NUE is finally calculated on yield basis, the information about the variability of yield and yield related components in the rice germplasm under low N situation is important for developing rice varieties with NUE. Thus, using rice landraces adapted to low inputs and strategy of association mapping, an attempt was made in the present study to identify promising donors for yield and the associated traits/parameters and genomic regions for yield under low N through i) evaluation of 472 genotypes comprising landraces and breeding lines under field conditions in wet (WS) and dry seasons (DS) with low and recommended N; ii) characterization of correlations of nine agro-morphological traits and parameters under low N iii) assessment of panicle component traits contributing towards yield under low N and v) to identify genomic regions associated with yield under low N using a strategy of minimum set of 50 polymorphic rice SSRs across 12 chromosomes through association mapping and fine mapping of a few associated genomic regions as a proof of concept.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of promising donors for yield under low N</title><p id="Par6">Wide variation with a general trend of reduction for the nine agro-morphological traits and parameters was observed in 472 genotypes under low N compared to recommended N across the seasons under field evaluation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

MLM considers both population structure and kinship for association mapping, thus is more suitable for the material of the present study over GLM, where only population structure is considered for analyses. Under low N in wet season, seven marker trait associations with five SSRs under field conditions were identified (RM495, RM22, RM55, RM169 and RM1381). Interestingly, NHI% was associated with four markers (RM495, RM169, RM22 and RM1381). RM22 also had shown association with two morphological traits, plant height and SPAD. HI was found to be associated with RM55. For dry season, grain yield was associated with RM514 and RM507. The total N uptake and IE were found to be associated with RM1381 and RM22, while RM495 was associated with panicles m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. For panicle traits, 21 traits associations with 10 SSRs were observed. RM271 found to be the most promising marker with associations of grain filling (%) of secondary branches, spikelets on primary branches of lower portion, grain filling (%) of lower portion, grains on lower portion and total grains. The length of the panicle was associated with RM507. Spikelets on primary branches of upper portion found to be associated with RM208 and lower portion with RM271. Spikelets on secondary branches of lower portion were associated with RM22 and RM210. The spikelets on branches of lower portion were associated with RM169 and the total spikelets on primary branches with RM154. Grains on primary branches of lower portion were associated with RM22 and on secondary branches of lower portion with RM154.

The variability of IE across the genotypes may also be due to the differential rate of radial and axial flow of total N, its distribution to sources and sinks (leaves or roots or panicles) at different stages, remobilization from older organs to active tissues, flag leaf N import/export, leaf senescence patterns, efficiency in converting CO<sub>2</sub> to carbohydrate and retention of N in the straw at maturity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">While expected correlations were obtained with grain yield and total N uptake in the analyses of genotypes as high, moderate and poor yielders, an interesting observation was the high yielders across the season efficiently partition their N into grain yield, whereas the low yielders convert their N for increasing their biomass.

Maximum reduction for the number of spikelets and grains on secondary branches of lower portion under low N suggested the limitation of assimilates for the production of the spikelets and their filling on secondary branches of lower portion under low N. In fact, yield increase in the high yielding varieties of rice under green revolution was credited to the increase of the grain as well as spikelet number on secondary branches which is dependent on the N fertilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

For each SSR locus, rare alleles in the population (defined as alleles with frequency &#x0003c;5%) were treated as null alleles. Two statistical models (GLM and MLM) were used to evaluate the effects of population structure (Q) and relative kinship (K) for marker-trait associations. The P value (0.05) was used to identify statistically significant loci. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used as a threshold for significant associations as per Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) correction method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.
