    "Soil pH is the main factor affecting soil nutrient availability and chemical substances in soil. It is of great significance to study the spatial variability of soil pH for the management of soil nutrients and the prediction of soil pollution. In order to explore the causes of spatial variability in soil pH in red-bed areas, the Nanxiong Basin in south China was selected as an example, and soil pH was measured in the topsoil by nested sampling (0-20 cm depth). The spatial variability characteristics of soil pH were analyzed by geostatistics and classical statistical methods, and the main factors influencing spatial variability in soil pH are discussed. The coefficient of variation in the red-bed areas of Nanxiong Basin was 17.18%, indicating moderate variability. Geostatistical analysis showed that the spherical model is the optimal theoretical model for explaining variability in soil pH, which is influenced by both structural and random factors. Analysis of the spatial distribution and pattern showed that soil pH is relatively high in the northeast and southwest, and is lower in the northwest. These results indicate that land use patterns and topographic factors are the main and secondary influencing factors, respectively."
