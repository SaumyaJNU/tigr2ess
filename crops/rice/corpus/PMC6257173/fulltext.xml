A high concentration of iron in groundwater can precipitate arsenic and reduce its bioavailability, however high concentrations of arsenic and iron can also reduce rice production. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about chemical contamination from inorganic fertilizers used to grow rice. The relationship between soil geochemistry and arsenic concentrations in rice is not yet fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives.</title><p>The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between arsenic concentrations in irrigation water, soil and rice collected from different sites in Cambodia. A secondary objective was to explore arsenic and phosphorus levels in fertilizer samples obtained from the study area in Cambodia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods.</title><p>The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, 11 inorganic fertilizer samples and conducted interviews with 44 families along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total arsenic, and arsenic species in the water and rice were conducted in Canada by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses for metals, total arsenic and phosphorus in soils and inorganic fertilizers were conducted in Cambodia and Singapore by X-ray fluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results.</title><p>The concentration of arsenic in rice paddy soils was highly variable and as much as 20 times higher near the irrigation wells than in more distal areas of the paddy. Two farmers in Preak Russey had integrated soil samples with arsenic levels above the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and above the Dutch concentration requiring intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The highest total arsenic measured in soil was 95 mg/kg. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions.</title><p>Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not on inactivation of arsenic in soil. The high levels of iron in groundwater mitigate arsenic toxicity, but the accumulation of iron could later result in lower rice productivity. Irrigation of rice with groundwater is not likely sustainable. To improve rice productivity, the content of phosphorus in local inorganic fertilizers must be improved to world standards. X-ray fluorescence analysis can quickly identify poor quality fertilizers.</p></sec><sec><title>Informed Consent.</title><p> Obtained</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests.</title><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>arsenic</kwd><kwd>remediation</kwd><kwd>bioaccumulation</kwd><kwd>irrigation</kwd><kwd>dimethylarsinic acid</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arsenic bioaccumulation in rice is a serious threat to agricultural production and public health.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The primary source of arsenic in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other countries in South and Southeast Asia is oxidation of arsenopyrite that naturally occurs in the Himalayan Mountains. The importance of local metamorphic rocks with arsenopyrite in Cambodia is not fully documented and likely will become more important as more of these rock outcroppings are exploited for construction materials.</p><p>The arsenic in soils is relatively stable and dissolution of arsenic into groundwater is largely mediated by introduction of iron or fresh organic matter to groundwater.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the areas of greatest arsenic contamination in Cambodian rice, arsenic primarily reflects use of groundwater for irrigation.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is generally believed that it takes years of irrigation with groundwater for soil to be contaminated with arsenic before rice becomes badly contaminated with arsenic.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Groundwater is initially anoxic and highly enriched with both arsenic and iron. When the irrigated water is oxygenated, the high concentrations of iron in irrigation water initially precipitates arsenic. In fields, the solubility of the arsenic is increased when the oxygen concentration decreases as the fields are flooded in the growing period. Growing rice in oxygenated soil markedly reduces arsenic bioaccumulation.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There are systems of rice cultivation such as the system of rice intensification (SRI) that use less water, produce oxic growing conditions and can significantly decrease arsenic bioaccumulation.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, it has been reported that Cambodian farmers are hesitant to release water that they may later need and also prefer not to use the SRI method due to increased labor requirements.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Globally, there are places where agricultural chemicals have resulted in arsenic contamination.

For sites Preak Russey-2 and Preak Russey-9, 4 sets of samples were collected for a limited spatial analysis. Soil samples were air dried and then ground with a mortar and pestle.

An earlier study in Preak Russey showed a slightly stronger relationship (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.682) between the total arsenic content of rice grain and arsenic of soil.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> There was one outlier sample from site Preak Russey-1. If the Preak Russey-1 result was removed, the regression coefficient of determination increased to 0.784. The rice from this Preak Russey-1 field had much greater total arsenic concentration relative to the soil content of arsenic of other farms. The rice at Preak Russey-1 was yellowish, indicating chlorosis. Arsenic toxicity can produce scorching of leaves.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> But the arsenic level in the soil of Preak Russey-1 was one of the lowest in Preak Russey, and the reported rice production was not reduced (Table 5, Appendix 2 of the IRDC report).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> If the chlorosis at Preak Russey-1 did reflect arsenic toxicity, there was likely another unknown variable enhancing the arsenic toxicity. There was nothing obviously unusual noted about the farm management, but we were unable to evaluate parasites, phosphorus or levels of other soil nutrients such as zinc, sulfur, silicon, potassium, or nitrogen on most farms. Low soil phosphorus content is a potential mechanism by which arsenic in rice may become elevated at a particular site. However, soil phosphorus analyses (as described below) suggest an alternate mechanism behind the higher arsenic bioaccumulation rates observed in Preak Russey-1.</p><p>The worst soil found in Preak Russey contained 95 mg/kg of arsenic, almost twice that of the intervention value/indicative level for serious contamination in Holland.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The concentration of arsenic in the rice paddy soils was highly variable and much higher near the irrigation wells (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f03">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f04">4</xref></italic>). Precipitation near the irrigation wells of Preak Russey is driven by the high concentration of iron in groundwater (9565&#x000b1;6635 &#x003bc;g/L, n=20) and once iron is exposed to the atmosphere, arsenic readily precipitates with iron. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f05">Figure 5</xref> shows that the soil surface was reddish or yellow in places due to iron precipitation. The red color likely reflects hematite, a ferric oxide. The yellow color is likely limonite, a hydrated ferric oxide. Perhaps even more illustrative is the intense precipitation of iron on the roots of rice (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f06">Figure 6</xref></italic>). This iron precipitation will strongly influence the biogeochemistry of arsenic, phosphorus, zinc and other nutrients and toxins. Although iron suppresses arsenic toxicity, such soils that are stained by iron from groundwater irrigation are impacted in negative ways as well. CEDAC, a Cambodian NGO that trains and manages about 160,000 farming families believes that such iron stained soils, even outside of the arsenic zone are usually unproductive.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><fig id="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f03" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Spatial variability in soil arsenic relative to the well site Preak Russey-2.

The farmer at site Preak Russey-15 had been growing rice for 20 years on two fields, one with surface water only and one using groundwater in the dry season. With the same farming practices, he observed a 29% greater productivity in the field irrigated with surface water. The suppressed productivity in the field irrigated with groundwater may represent arsenic toxicity, but iron toxicity is also possible. Both farmers at sites Preak Russey-4 and Preak Russey-17 claimed that when they were unable to dilute the groundwater with surface water, their rice productivity decreased and irrigation of cucumbers with 100% groundwater resulted in no crop production.</p></sec><sec><title>Iron loadings to soil</title><p>Especially in Preak Russey, the loading of iron to the soils was quite large and likely restricted most arsenic phytotoxicity to near the wells.

Using the formula of FeO(OH)-6H<sub>2</sub>O for limonite, the loading of this iron mineral is estimated to be 266 kg/ha per year. Limonite is a hydrated hematite that is often called &#x0201c;bog iron&#x0201d;.

The concentration of phosphorus in the soils of site Preak Russey-1 was the 3rd highest measured; this site had higher than average rice productivity, and there is no support for the hypothesis discussed earlier that phosphorus limitation might have caused the enhanced arsenic bioaccumulation relative to the soil content of arsenic in Preak Russey-1.

Some variables influencing arsenic bioaccumulation vary from year to year. In our study, the intensity of monsoons, availability of surface water, and quality of inorganic fertilizers varied considerably and could all affect arsenic contamination.</p><p>The Dutch soil remediation intervention values &#x0201c;indicate when the functional properties of the soil for humans, plant and animal life are seriously impaired or threatened&#x0201d;.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In 2015, Holland proposed a new guideline for maximum permissible addition of arsenic of 0.0012 mg/kg.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> If this increment was based on the loading of arsenic, it would not permit use of groundwater irrigation at Preak Russey, Cambodia.</p><p>The net incremental addition of arsenic to soils is not simple to predict from loading measurements. Loss rates from erosion or volatilization are difficult to measure quantitatively. In Bangladesh, 24&#x02013;48% of the arsenic annually added to the study field from irrigation was removed from the soil during the monsoon season.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The data from the present study is less extensive, but at least qualitatively it seems that less arsenic was retained in Preak Russey soils. Our soil cores were 10 cm deep. In May 2016, the soils were drained and oxic, which resulted in the red color of the roots from iron oxide being strongly contrasted to the grey soils (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-f06">Figure 6</xref></italic>). At least 90% of the roots appeared to be less than 10 cm deep. Our depth of sample cores was shorter than ideal, but allow for simple estimates. Duxbury and Roberts showed that in Bangladesh, about 30% of the arsenic would be deeper than 10 cm.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our samples were 10 cm deep, and to be conservative, we doubled the amount of arsenic that was measured for a preliminary calculation of arsenic retention. This calculation suggests total arsenic export from the fields since the start of irrigation to be 96.5% for Preak Russey-2 and 95.5% for Preak Russey-9 fields. We also processed integrated soil sample cores from five fields and calculated that 96.5&#x000b1;4.0% of the arsenic added by irrigation was lost since groundwater irrigation began (3&#x02013;13 years), Appendix 2 of the IRDC report.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> If we were to go to the extreme of assuming that all soils were as contaminated as the worst soils measured near the wells, the retention of arsenic in the fields would still be less than 10% of what was loaded. Future work should collect more soil cores (~30/ha), evaluate the concentration of arsenic in deeper samples and use the kriging method for statistical analysis.</p><p>Spatial analysis is also needed for assessment of phytotoxicity from well water. Phytotoxicity would likely be better assessed by comparing rice productivity with associated arsenic in soil and water samples at varying distances from the irrigation wells. The spatial variability of arsenic accumulation in soil is not commonly measured, but it is very important in evaluating the effect of irrigation water.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Abedin et al. observed a 23% reduction in production of potted rice when irrigated with water having arsenic at a concentration of 1 mg/L, roughly the same arsenic concentration in irrigation water as used by Preak Russey-15.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Azad et al. found a 53% reduction in rice production from an arsenic solution of 1 mg/L.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> However, these controlled experiments in pots do not necessarily represent the responses of field conditions where most arsenic precipitates near the wells.</p><sec><title>Iron remediation options</title><p>Studies have suggested that addition of iron to paddy fields could overcome arsenic toxicity.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref> In Cambodia it would be possible to grind an iron-rich laterite and use it as an amendment to paddy soils.

The potential &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; dose of laterite to inactivate arsenic could easily be &#x0003e;1000 kg/ha/yr. The effective dose of three iron-rich materials (25%, 56% and 99% iron) used to block arsenic assimilation by rice in Japan was 5000 kg/ha.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Excavation, grinding and shipping this amount of laterite from a deposit in Mondulkurri (a mountainous area of Cambodia) is likely prohibitively expensive for rice farmers.</p><p>Iron additions to soils can reduce arsenic toxicity, but the iron will mostly persist in soils. This is the natural geochemistry producing bog iron deposits. There are strong reasons to be concerned about the long-term toxicity of high iron applications, including current irrigation with groundwater and suggested remedial options with iron.

Relative to the extensive publications on arsenic toxicity, iron toxicity does not get much attention. However, iron toxicity mainly affects rice productivity and iron is rarely a toxic concern to humans. Even outside of the arsenic-rich zone, the Cambodian Center for Study and Development in Agriculture (CEDAC) discourages the use of groundwater for irrigation because it forms yellow soils of low productivity.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Any irrigation technique that results in extensive periods of standing water and anoxia will produce iron toxicity.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The SRI approach that CEDAC encourages would decrease iron toxicity significantly, because this technique does not flood soils for extensive periods which results in low oxygen and high iron solubility.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180910-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, consultations with ~300 farmers could not find anyone in the arsenic-rich zone using SRI.

The most contaminated soils contained 95 mg/kg of arsenic, which is more than twice the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and almost twice the Dutch concentration requiring planning for intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The rice has more arsenic when the concentration of arsenic in soil is high, but still passes Codex guidelines. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers analyzed in this study had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus. Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not the inactivation of arsenic in soil.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by International Development Research Centre, IDRC Project No: 107718-00020799-032.
