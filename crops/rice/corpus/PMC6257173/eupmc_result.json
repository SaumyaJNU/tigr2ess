    "Background:In parts of Cambodia, irrigation with groundwater results in arsenic accumulation in soils and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. A high concentration of iron in groundwater can precipitate arsenic and reduce its bioavailability, however high concentrations of arsenic and iron can also reduce rice production. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about chemical contamination from inorganic fertilizers used to grow rice. The relationship between soil geochemistry and arsenic concentrations in rice is not yet fully understood. Objectives:The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between arsenic concentrations in irrigation water, soil and rice collected from different sites in Cambodia. A secondary objective was to explore arsenic and phosphorus levels in fertilizer samples obtained from the study area in Cambodia. Methods:The present study collected 61 well water samples, 105 rice samples, 70 soil samples, 11 inorganic fertilizer samples and conducted interviews with 44 families along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total arsenic, and arsenic species in the water and rice were conducted in Canada by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analyses for metals, total arsenic and phosphorus in soils and inorganic fertilizers were conducted in Cambodia and Singapore by X-ray fluorescence. Results:The concentration of arsenic in rice paddy soils was highly variable and as much as 20 times higher near the irrigation wells than in more distal areas of the paddy. Two farmers in Preak Russey had integrated soil samples with arsenic levels above the concentration associated with toxicity to rice in Taiwan (40 mg/kg) and above the Dutch concentration requiring intervention or remediation (55 mg/kg). The highest total arsenic measured in soil was 95 mg/kg. In Preak Russey, the loading of arsenic from irrigation water was 3710 times greater than the loading of arsenic from inorganic fertilizers. Half of the commercial inorganic fertilizers had less than 50% of the labelled content of phosphorus. Conclusions:Emphasis should be placed on improving the management of irrigation water, not on inactivation of arsenic in soil. The high levels of iron in groundwater mitigate arsenic toxicity, but the accumulation of iron could later result in lower rice productivity. Irrigation of rice with groundwater is not likely sustainable. To improve rice productivity, the content of phosphorus in local inorganic fertilizers must be improved to world standards. X-ray fluorescence analysis can quickly identify poor quality fertilizers. Informed Consent:Obtained. Competing Interests:The authors declare no competing financial interests."
