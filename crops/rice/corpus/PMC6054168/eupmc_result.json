    "Understanding the physiological responses of crops to drought is important for ensuring sustained crop productivity under climate change, which is expected to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of periods of drought. Drought responses involve multiple traits, and the correlations between these traits are poorly understood. Using a variety of techniques, we estimated the changes in gas exchange, leaf hydraulic conductance, and leaf turgor in rice (Oryza sativa) in response to both short- and long-term soil drought. We performed a photosynthetic limitation analysis to quantify the contributions of each limiting factor to the resultant overall decrease in photosynthesis during drought. Biomass, leaf area, and leaf width significantly decreased during the 2-week drought treatment, but leaf mass per area and leaf vein density increased. Light-saturated photosynthetic rate declined dramatically during soil drought, mainly due to the decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) and mesophyll conductance (gm). Stomatal modeling suggested that the decline in leaf hydraulic conductance explained most of the decrease in stomatal closure during the drought treatment, and may also trigger the drought-related decrease of stomatal conductance and mesophyll conductance. The results of this study provide insight into the regulation of carbon assimilation under drought conditions."
