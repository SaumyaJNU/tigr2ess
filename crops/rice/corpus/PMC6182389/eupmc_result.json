    "Common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) is invaluable genetic resource for rice resistance breeding. Whole-genome re-sequencing was conducted to systematically analyze the variations in two new inbred lines (Huaye 3 and Huaye 4) developed from a common wild rice. A total of 4,841,127 SNPs, 1,170,479 InDels, 24,080 structural variations (SVs), and 298 copy number variations (CNVs) were identified in three materials. Approximately 16.24 and 5.64% of the total SNPs and InDels of Huaye 3 and Huaye 4 were located in genic regions, respectively. Together, 12,486 and 15,925 large-effect SNPs, and 12,417 and 14,513 large-effect InDels, which affect the integrity of the encoded protein, were identified in Huaye 3 and Huaye 4, respectively. The distribution map of 194 and 245 NBS-LRR encoding homologs was constructed across 12 rice chromosomes. Further, GO enrichment analysis of the homologs with identical genotype variations in Huaye 3 and Huaye 4 revealed 67, 82, and 58 homologs involved in cell death, response to stress, and both terms, respectively. Comparative analysis displayed that 550 out of 652 SNPs and 129 out of 147 InDels were present in a widely used blast-susceptible rice variety (LTH). Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed a strong interaction between NBS-LRR candidates and several known R genes. One homolog of disease resistance protein (RPM1) was involved in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway. Artificial inoculation of disease/insect displayed resistance phenotypes against rice blast and brown planthopper in two lines. The results will provide allele-specific markers for rice molecular breeding."
