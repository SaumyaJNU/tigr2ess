    "Crown rust disease caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) is a major production constraint of oat in North America, Europe, and Australia. There are over 100 genes effective against one or more Pca races, but only a handful of seedling resistance (Pc) genes have been mapped to a known chromosomal location. The goal of the present study was to use linkage mapping to identify the genomic location of the Pc53 gene, and to produce a list of linked SNPs with potential as molecular markers for marker assisted breeding. The Pc53 gene was placed on the linkage group Mrg08 at 82.4 cM using F5-derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between the Pc53 carrier 6-112-1-15 (PI 311624) and the susceptible cultivar Otana. The map location was validated using RILs from a cross between 6-112-1-15 and the Pc50 differential line. Single nucleotide polymorphism marker GMI_ES02_c14533_567 was the closest to Pc53. A major seedling resistance gene 'PcKM' and QTL QcC.Core.08.1, QCr.Core.08.2, QCr.Core.08.3 and QCr.cdl9-12D were previously reported on Mrg08. QPc.Core.08.1 and PcKM were mapped to within 1 cM of Pc53; but previous virulence studies have indicated separate identities. The chromosomal location of Pc53 and SNPs linked with it will facilitate the utilization of Pc53 in oat breeding programs."
