    "<label>BACKGROUND</label>The calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) and CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) signaling system plays a key regulatory role in plant stress signaling. The roles of plant-specific CIPKs, essential for CBL-CIPK functions, in the response to various abiotic stresses have been extensively studied so far. However, until now, the possible roles of the CIPKs in the plant response to heavy metal toxicities are largely unknown.<label>RESULTS</label>In this study, we used bioinformatic and molecular strategies to isolate 12 HsCIPK genes in Tibetan Plateau annual wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum C. Koch) and subsequently identified their functional roles in the response to heavy metal toxicities. The results showed that multiple HsCIPKs were transcriptionally regulated by heavy metal toxicities (e.g., Hg, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Cu) and other abiotic stresses (e.g., salt, drought, aluminum, low and high temperature, and abscisic acid). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of each HsCIPK in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) showed that transgenic plants of multiple HsCIPKs displayed enhanced tolerance of root growth to heavy metal toxicities (Hg, Cd, Cr, and Cu), salt and drought stresses. These results suggest that HsCIPKs are involved in the response to heavy metal toxicities and other abiotic stresses.<label>CONCLUSIONS</label>Tibetan Plateau annual wild barley HsCIPKs possess broad applications in genetically engineering of rice with tolerance to heavy metal toxicities and other abiotic stresses."
