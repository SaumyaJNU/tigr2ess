    "OBJECTIVE:Bacterial canker is a destructive disease of kiwifruit caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). To understand the disease-causing mechanism of Psa, a kiwifruit yeast two-hybrid cDNA library was constructed to identify putative host targets of the Psa Type Three Secreted Effector AvrPto5. RESULTS:In this study, we used the Mate & Plate™ yeast two-hybrid library method for constructing a kiwifruit cDNA library from messenger RNA of young leaves. The constructed library consisted of 2.15 × 106 independent clones with an average insert size of 1.52 kb. The screening of the kiwifruit yeast two-hybrid cDNA library with Psa AvrPto5 revealed the interaction of a V-type proton ATPase subunit-H, a proline rich-protein and heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 26. Among these, heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein 26 showed a positive interaction with Psa AvrPto5 as both prey and bait."
