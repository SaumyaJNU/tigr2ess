    "Seed germination, a pivotal process in higher plants, is precisely regulated by various external and internal stimuli, including brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA) phytohormones. The molecular mechanisms of crosstalk between BRs and GAs in regulating plant growth are well established. However, whether BRs interact with GAs to coordinate seed germination remains unknown, as do their common downstream targets. In the present study, 45 differentially expressed proteins responding to both BR and GA deficiency were identified using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis during seed germination. The results indicate that crosstalk between BRs and GAs participates in seed germination, at least in part, by modulating the same set of responsive proteins. Moreover, most targets exhibited concordant changes in response to BR and GA deficiency, and gene ontology (GO) indicated that most possess catalytic activity and are involved in various metabolic processes. Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis was used to construct a regulatory network of downstream proteins mediating BR- and GA-regulated seed germination. The mutation of GRP, one representative target, notably suppressed seed germination. Our findings not only provide critical clues for validating BR‚ÅªGA crosstalk during rice seed germination, but also help to optimise molecular regulatory networks."
