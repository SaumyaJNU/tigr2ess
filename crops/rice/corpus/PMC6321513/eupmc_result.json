    "Eco-agricultural systems aim to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers in order to improve sustainable production and maintain a healthy ecosystem. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of rice-frog farming on the bacterial community and N-cycling microbes in paddy rhizosphere soil. This experiment involved three rice cultivation patterns: Conventionally cultivated rice (CR), green rice-frog farming (GR), and organic rice-frog farming (OR). The rice yield, paddy soil enzyme activities, physicochemical variables and bacterial and N-cycling bacterial abundances were quantitatively analyzed. Rice-frog cultivations significantly increased soil protease, nitrate and reductase activity. Additionally, the nirS gene copy number and the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria also increased, however urease activity and the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria significantly decreased. The bacterial community richness and diversity of OR soil was significantly higher than that of the GR or CR soil. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of GR was highest. The N-cycling bacterial community was positively correlated with the total carbon (TC), total nitrogren (TN) and carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. The present work strengthens our current understanding of the soil bacterial community structure and its functions under rice-frog farming. The present work also provides certain theoretical support for the selection of rational rice cultivation patterns."
