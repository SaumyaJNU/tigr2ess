There are no successful ways of controlling this disease and there has been little study of mechanisms of resistance to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>. Based on transcriptional data of different infection time points, we found 23, 782 and 23, 718 differentially expressed genes (fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million, FPKM &#x0003e;1) in Jiangcheng 3A (resistant to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>) and 9311A (susceptible to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>), respectively. In order to illuminate the differential responses of the two rice male sterile lines to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>, we identified gene co-expression modules using the method of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and compared the different biological functions of gene co-expression networks in key modules at different infection time points. The results indicated that gene co-expression networks in the two rice genotypes were different and that genes contained in some modules of the two groups may play important roles in resistance to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>, such as DTH8 and OsHop/Sti1a. Furthermore, these results provide a global view of the responses of two different phenotypes to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>, and assist our understanding of the regulation of expression changes after <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Aiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the scientific and technological research program of the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (KJ15012017) and the National Natural Science Foundation (31400130).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rice kernel smut (RKS), caused by the soil-borne basidiomycete fungus <italic>Tilletia horrida</italic>, is the most devastating disease during the production of rice male sterile lines in most hybrid rice growing regions of the world [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RKS can lead to yield losses of 5&#x02013;20% in general and even 50% in severe cases [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it is an increasing threat to rice cultivation in Asia, Oceania, Europe, America, and Africa [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although the quantitative resistant of rice male sterile lines to the RKS have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], complete resistance or immunity have not been found. Despite the importance of RKS, there have been few studies of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>, partly because as a biotrophic pathogen, cultured it on artificial media is extremely difficult and there are very few effective resistant rice cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>With the development of sequencing techniques, transcriptome analysis and genomics have promoted the study of the molecular mechanisms of disease resistance and tolerance to stress [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These processes often involve multiple biological function genes; however, the analysis of multiple function genes using traditional biological methods is difficult [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In previous studies, the identification of candidate genes that related to biological phenotype was mainly based on comparing gene expression levels of differentially expressed genes between different experimental groups [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This method mainly focused on single model research, nowadays, the study of molecular interactions in dynamic network changes has been extended [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Biological networks provide valuable platforms for understanding system-level response to different biological phenotypes, such as disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The main biological networks include signaling networks, protein&#x02013;protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, and gene co-expression networks. Of these four biological networks, gene co-expression networks analysis has many advantages [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the functionality of genes involved in biological phenotypes, in which nodes represent genes and edges are used to connect two correlated genes to express the relationship between them [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202309.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that co-expression network could identify how gene expression is regulated and involved in each different phenotype based on a more systematic perspective; they can also explore the relationship of gene functionality to phenotype by observing pairwise correlations between gene transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202309.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is a systems biology approach that describes the correlation of modules according to microarray analysis, and showed how modules of highly correlated genes facilitate an understanding of multiple gene expression networks instead of individual genes [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, related functionally enriched modules are implicated in complex diseases and many candidate biomarkers or genes have been successfully identified using this method, e.g. wheat resistance responses to powdery mildew [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We set out to clarify which systemic functions of cellular components are important in resistance to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> in rice, and to understand the change in gene expression in resistant and susceptible host backgrounds. We used the rice male sterile line Jiangcheng 3A, which is resistant to kernel smut, and a susceptible rice male sterile line, 9311A, as host plants to investigate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> infection. We set out to identify the genes and major modules related to resistance against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> infection and to analyze the genes that are involved in resistance co-expression networks using WGCNA. Based on transcriptomics data, we compared the gene co-expression networks of these two rice varieties after infection with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic>. Our results explain the changes in gene expression after <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> infection by providing an efficient gene co-expression network in two rice varieties with different defensive phenotypes.

In both Jiangcheng 3A and 9311A, plant-pathogen interaction, phenylalanine metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction were common metabolic pathways involved in resistance, the pathways were more enriched in Jiangcheng 3A than in 9311A. In addition, plant-pathogen interaction, phenylalanine metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction were shown to be crucial in the overall resistance process. For example, previous studies have shown that phenylalanine metabolism produced many secondary metabolites associated with plant disease resistance, such as lignins, salicylates, coumarins, flavonoids, and phytoalexins [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

The pathway of phenylalanine metabolism produced the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and was key to salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis, SA is more important than jasmonic acid in defence response against biotrophic fungi [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>Folate biosynthesis showed a significant accumulation in Jiangcheng 3A at the early stage, but this was not found in 9311A. The precursor of para-aminomethyl- benzoic acid (Paba) that forms as an intermediate metabolite in the process of folate biosynthesis, is a branched acid, which can participate in the synthesis of lignin though the formation of phenylalanine. The pathway of phenylalanine metabolism showed a significant accumulation in Jiangcheng 3A at 48 h. This result demonstrated that primary metabolism is involved in the resistance process at the beginning of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>horrida</italic> infection and that SA plays an important role at 48 h and thereafter. Other pathways related to resistance, such as flavonoid biosynthesis and cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis also accumulated in Jiangcheng 3A at 48 h.

In addition, several MYB TFs are also found in hub genes, which mainly regulate secondary metabolism, such as hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stressor [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0202309.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. So, our clarification of TF mechanisms involved in resistance processes will not only lead to the understanding of signal transduction networks through controlling TFs, but will also lead to the discovery of new resistance-related genes.</p><p>In plant defense response processes, the key known resistance genes are important markers. In our study, several protein kinases, such as OsPBL1, OsSRK, CTB4a and serine/threonine-protein kinase NAK, had high connectivity in networks of key resistance genes in Jiangcheng 3A and 9311A. Protein kinase have an important role in the regulation of signal perception, transmission, the gene expression and many other physiological processes in regulating plant growth and defense response [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. MAPKKK serine/threonine-protein kinase is involved in the regulation of a MAP kinase cascade that negatively regulates SA dependent defense responses, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, and ethylene-induced senescence [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Lee et al. identified that the serine/threonine protein kinase OsPBL1 is a key resistance gene to rice stripe disease, and that it is regulated downstream from the actions of cytokinin and SA [<xref rid="pone.0202309.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Other genes related to resistance, such as wx, OsDof3, and OsARF24 were also found in the core gene network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202309.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec
