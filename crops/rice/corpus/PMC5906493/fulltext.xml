commonly presents a certain genetic distance to a 2-line restorer line, but in many cases, 2-line restorer lines present defects upon recovery of the object cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of the maintainer line, which impedes the utilization of their heterosis. Here, we report a strategy and an example of converting a maintainer into a photoperiod/temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (P/TGMS) line with an almost identical genetic background, thus maximizing the heterosis. Firstly, through treatment of maintainer line T98B with <sup>60</sup>C<sub>O</sub>-&#x003b3; irradiation, we identified the TGMS line T98S, which is sterile at higher temperatures and fertile at lower temperatures. Secondly, the T98S line was proven to be identical to T98B with regard to genetic background via an examination of 48 parental polymorphous SSR markers and exhibited excellent blossom traits similar to those of T98B, with an extensive forenoon flowering rate of 75.92% and a high exertion rate of 64.59%. Thirdly, in a combination test, three out of six hybrids from T98S crossed with 2-line restorer lines showed a yield increase of 6.70&#x02013;15.69% for 2 consecutive years. These results demonstrated that the strategy can generate a new P/TGMS line with strong general combining ability (converted from a maintainer line), thus helping to increase the genetic diversity of male sterile heterotic groups.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s11032-018-0805-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hybrid rice</kwd><kwd>Heterosis utilization</kwd><kwd>Maintainer line</kwd><kwd>Photoperiod/temperature-sensitive male sterile line</kwd><kwd><sup>60</sup>C<sub>O</sub>-&#x003b3; irradiation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the national key research and development program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0101100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Dingyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31301292</award-id><award-id>31501243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Yanning</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xuewu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution> Agriculture Science and Technology Innovation Program in Hunan,China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017XC09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Yanning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It is of great importance to breed high-yield hybrid rice to feed the growing worldwide population. The 3-line and 2-line systems are the two basic methods employed to generate hybrid rice seeds. These two methods differ in breeding efficiency due to their use of two different types of male sterile lines. The 3-line system utilizes a cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line, whose multiplication is managed by using a maintainer line. Usually, the CMS line and its corresponding maintainer are genetically very close siblings, differing only in the loci responsible for controlling flower and pollen behavior. In the production of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, the male sterility conferred by the CMS line is restored by a so-called restorer line (R line), as male sterility is controlled by cytoplasm and nucleus interaction, with the nuclear R gene being dominant over the cytoplasmic CMS gene (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>). Less than 5% of current germplasm resources can be used as restorer lines for 3-line system hybrid production, which makes it difficult to obtain elite combinations (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>; Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">In contrast, the 2-line system is based on a photoperiod/temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (P/TGMS) line. Because the P/TGMS line is controlled by a recessive nuclear gene(s), almost any normal cultivar can be used as its restorer line, thus greatly improving the probability of selecting favorable combinations (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). In addition, the 3-line and 2-line systems vary in terms of the propagation of their sterile lines. The P/TGMS line can self-reproduce if the environmental photoperiods and/or temperature conditions are favorable (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). Such advantages as a broad selection of restorer lines, relative freedom to combine with male lines and a simplified procedure for propagating the sterile line make the 2-line system superior in hybrid rice breeding, enabling breeders to realize higher heterosis and explore commercial breeding of heterotic groups more efficiently.</p><p id="Par4">However, developing high-yield hybrid rice is still very challenging because heterosis in rice is not yet fully understood. Heterosis in hybrid rice relies on parental distance and generally, the greater the distance, the stronger the heterosis (Ding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>). In particular, parental lines of different geographic origins, of different ecotypes or belonging to separate subspecies, are likely to generate combinations with strong heterosis. For instance, the 3-line hybrid rice Shan-You 63 was derived from two cultivars with a large geographical distance between their areas of origin&#x02014;Zhen-Shan 97A/B&#x02014;which is an early-season rice planted along the Chinese Yangtze River, and Ming-Hui 63, an inbred line created from the Philippine rice IR630 and the Guyana rice Gui-630 (Xie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1987</xref>). Another example is the 2-line hybrid rice Liang-You-Pei 9, which is the offspring of the Indica-Japonica male sterile line Pei-ai 64S and the Indica restorer line 93-11 (Lu and Zou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>). Genetic diversity among cultivars is declining because a limited number of key lines have been used widely and repeatedly. Therefore, developing a reasonable solution to extend the parental genetic distance is critical in pushing genetic gains in hybrid rice breeding.</p><p id="Par5">The 3-line maintainer line commonly presents a certain genetic distance to a 2-line restorer line, which provides a considerable opportunity to generate P/TGMS lines by converting the maintainer line. Maintainers with a strong general combining ability and desirable blossom habits are ideal donors for P/TGMS lines. At present, the most successful P/TGMS line Y58S originated from the maintainer line V20B and Fei-Gai B (Deng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>). To date, more than 90 hybrids with Y58S as a parental line have been released (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ricedata.cn/variety">http://www.ricedata.cn/variety/</ext-link>). A recent study identified a total of 20,562 non-synonymous SNPs spanning 8854 genes between maintainer line V20B and 2-line restorer line 93-11 through deep re-sequencing (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>), revealing that a considerable genetic distance existed between the maintainer line and the 2-line restorer line.</p><p id="Par6">The P/TGMS line in release is primarily composed of two types: the PTGMS line and TGMS line (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>). The fertility of the PTGMS line is co-regulated by photoperiod and temperature, while that of the TGMS line is controlled only by temperature (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1996</xref>). The PTGMS trait and TGMS trait are independently controlled by the <italic>p/tms12-1</italic> (or <italic>pms3</italic>) and <italic>tms5</italic> genes (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; Ding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>; Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). Hence, breeders have transferred these genes into other genetic backgrounds to generate new P/TGMS lines, but this work is labor-intensive and requires more than 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we proposed a strategy for converting the maintainer line into a practical P/TGMS line with an identical genetic background with the exception of the mutated locus, thus ensuring that 2-line restorer lines can be utilized with P/TGMS lines for developing high-yield combinations through mutagenesis. In this study, we report the successful conversion of the maintainer line T98B into a P/TGMS line (T98S) via gamma irradiation treatment. The logic is depicted in Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. The agronomic traits of T98S and its 2-line-based hybrid rice were also studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and experiment site</title><p id="Par8">The rice variety T98B is an Indica maintainer line developed from wild-abortive CMS line T98A. T98S is a P/TGMS line acquired from T98B via <sup>60</sup>C<sub>O</sub>-&#x003b3; irradiation. The six early-season Indica cultivars used, including Xiang-Zao 45 (XZ45), Zhong-Jia-Zao17 (ZJZ17), Zao-116 (Z116), Zao-102 (Z102), Zao-143 (Z143), and Zao-996 (Z996), are conventional varieties or 2-line restorer lines. All of the above materials were provided by the State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Changsha, Hunan Province, China.</p><p id="Par9">The radiation treatment of T98B was contracted to Hunan Provincial Radiation Center, Changsha, China, in 2010. Approximately 9000 mature seeds from T98B were treated with <sup>60</sup>Co-&#x003b3; at 300&#x000a0;Gy (5.5&#x000a0;Gy/min for 55.5&#x000a0;min). Then, the M<sub>0</sub> seeds were germinated and transplanted singly in a field in Changsha, China. The screening of P/TGMS plants in the field was conducted in Sanya, Hainan Province, and Changsha, Hunan Province, China, from 2011 to 2012. The verification of the TGMS trait in T98S in-chamber was performed in Changsha in 2013. The field investigation of the basic agronomic traits of T98S was carried out in Changsha in 2013 and 2014, blossom traits were examined in Changsha in 2014, and the yield components were examined in Changsha in 2015 and 2016.

Later, two regenerated plants labeled BM2-10 and BM2-23 were observed to change in fertility from May to October when planted in Changsha, China. If headed before May 10th, in accordance with a daily mean temperature below 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and a photoperiod of approximately 13.10&#x02013;13.20&#x000a0;h during the young panicle differential phase, the two plants presented light yellowish anthers and accumulated a few round-and-stained normal pollen grains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). If headed from early June to early September, when the daily mean temperature ranged from 28.0 to 34.0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and the photoperiod ranged from 12.0 to 13.7&#x000a0;h, they exhibited white shrunken anthers and maintained a sterile state. In this phase, the plants presented three types of abortive pollen grains, namely, round-but-empty pollen, irregular pollen, and null pollen, and the null pollen grains occurred at the highest temperature from June 20th to August 15th (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Thereafter, with the temperature and photoperiod declining from September 25th to October 20th, a conversion from sterility to fertility was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Based on the definition of P/TGMS, we supposed that BM2-10 and BM2-23 would be P/TGMS plants.

The 3-line breeding technique opened an era for rice heterosis utilization, and 3-line combination outperformed the same-growth-period inbred conventional rice under the same conditions by 20% in yield (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). Later, the 2-line breeding technique relying on P/TGMS lines was successfully established (Shi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1985</xref>), and it has prompted the rapid development of higher-yield super rice breeding because P/TGMS rice has a broad selection of resources (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). Accordingly, several elite super 2-line hybrid rice lines such as Peiai-64S/93-11(Liang-You-Pei 9), Y58S/93-11(Y Liang-You No.1), Y58S/Yuan-hui2 (Y Liang-You no. 2), and Y58S/900 (Y Liang-You 900) achieved yield targets of 10.5&#x000a0;t/ha in 2001, 12.0&#x000a0;t/ha in 2004, 13.5&#x000a0;t/ha in 2011, and 15.0&#x000a0;t/ha in 2014 for the Chinese Super Rice Research and Promotion Plan (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>; Wu et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par26">A moderate parental genetic difference is required in hybrid breeding, and utilizing heterosis among CMS lines (or maintainer lines) and 2-line restorer lines seems promising. Previous studies showed that early-season Indica cultivars from southern China and the varieties originated from Southeast Asian countries were recognized as two heterotic groups, and these lines together were utilized to produce high-yield 3-line hybrid rice (Yuan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1977</xref>). Recently, another work using genetic background detection through genome re-sequencing proved that maintainer line V20B was genetically distant to the 2-line restorer line 93-11 (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). In another exploration of heterosis between CMS lines and 2-line restorer lines, we investigated the yield factors from combinations of T98A crossed with 2-line early-season restorer lines such as XZ45, Z116, and Z996 and found that the combinations presented a panicle and grain structure better than that of the commonly used hybrid rice ZLY819 (Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Disappointingly, however, these combinations could not be fertilized and fruited due to the infertility of the male parents. Our strategy of transforming a maintainer line into a P/TGMS line can make full use of their heterosis. The fact that we identified TGMS line T98S from T98B produced by <sup>60</sup>CO-&#x003b3; irradiation treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and succeeded in obtaining high-yield combinations from T98S crossed with 2-line restorer lines opens a gate for diversifying the female lines of rice hybrids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This outcome is of great importance in solving the problem in which in 3-line rice hybrid systems, the wild-abortive germplasm accounts for more than 60% of the CMS germplasm background (Ding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>), and only very limited germplasm types can restore fertility when crossed with an abortive CMS line. When more lines can be converted to PTGMS lines in 2-line systems, the major constraint of 3-line hybrid rice systems having a narrow genetic background is addressed, thus conferring great potential in advancing genetic gains in hybrid rice breeding.</p><p id="Par27">A key point in this strategy is to choose a maintainer line with agronomic traits that are as desirable as possible for converting into a PTGMS line. In general, strong general combining ability should be highlighted first, which will maximize the selection probability for elite combinations (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1996</xref>). Maintainer line T98B is an ideal germplasm with a strong combining ability derived from core parent V20B (Deng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>), and it has been employed to develop more than 60 combinations via its CMS line T98A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ricedata.cn/variety">http://www.ricedata.cn/variety/</ext-link>). In this study, six combinations based on T98S had a high seed-setting rate above 80.00% in 2015, three of which showed a mean yield increase of 6.70&#x02013;15.69% compared with ZLY819 in 2015 and 2016 (Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggesting that T98S has potential for generating new high-yield combinations. Optimal flowering habits are another trait that is critical for enhancing the productivity of hybrid rice seeds (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1996</xref>). T98A/T98B has a good flowering habit, and the hybrid seed production based on T98A can reach a high level of 4.50&#x02013;5.25&#x000a0;t/ha (Deng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). In our study, the TGMS line T98S demonstrated a forenoon flowering rate of 75.92% and a high exerted-stigma flower rate of 64.59%, which was considerably better than that in T98A (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, c).</p><p id="Par28">Identifying a PTGMS line in the field is another key step in this strategy that involves continuous observations of fertility under varied temperatures and photoperiods. Our field experiment was carried out in Changsha, China, from early May to late October, with temperatures ranging from 22.0 to 35.0&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and photoperiods varying from 12.0 to 14.0&#x000a0;h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Such conditions are highly suitable for screening PTGMS lines. T98S underwent alternations in fertility at least twice. The first alternation from fertility to sterility occurred from May 10th to 20th, and the second shift from sterility to fertility occurred from September 10th to 25th. Both periods involved violent fluctuations in temperature. Ultimately, through a fixed environment in a chamber, we proved that T98S was a forward-type TGMS line (FTGMS) with sterility under high temperatures but fertility at lower temperatures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In fact, most TGMS lines in practice, such as Y58S and Guang-Zhan 63S, are FTGMS lines (Deng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>; Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>). FTGMS lines produce hybrid rice seeds safely over an extensive area during a long period since they can maintain sterility from early June to late October in southern China. However, the reverse-type TGMS line (RTGMS) exhibits sterility at lower temperatures but fertility at higher temperatures (Yang and Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1996</xref>) and is quite unfavorable for producing F<sub>1</sub> seeds in early spring at lower latitudes or in summer at higher latitudes. Thus, from this perspective, T98S is a very productive FTGMS line. Furthermore, due to T98S being equal to T98A in genetic background and basic agronomic traits, we considered T98S to be a good replacement for T98A in producing hybrid seeds at a lower cost and with easier seed field management.</p><p id="Par29">Given that foreign P/TGMS plants were probably mixed in with the mutagenesis population, it was necessary to validate whether T98S mutated from T98B. To this end, we compared T98S with T98B both at the morphological level and at the genetic level. Investigation of the morphological specificity revealed that T98S was very similar to T98B in plant shape, and they showed identical agronomic characteristics including panicle length, grain number per panicle, and flowering habits (Table <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S1</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Similar results were observed in paired combinations based on crossing T98S and T98A with the same female parent (Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). To further confirm that T98S was derived from T98B, we carried out a genetic background test using 48 parental polymorphism SSR markers (Lin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>), and the results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) also supported that T98S was a single-locus mutant from T98B.</p><p id="Par30">A series of studies showed that P/TGMS mutants are likely to be obtained by point mutation or indel mutation, and thus, a few <italic>p/tgms</italic> genes have been discovered located on various chromosomes. For instance, the first documented PTGMS line was identified as a natural mutant among an open field of the rice variety &#x0201c;Nongken58&#x0201d; in 1973, and it was later confirmed by Mendelian genetic analysis that the photosensitivity of lines is controlled by a recessive male-sterile allele in rice (Shi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1985</xref>). Many subsequent publications supported Shi&#x02019;s conclusion, such as those showing that <italic>Sokcho-MS</italic> (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>) and <italic>G20S</italic> (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>) were spontaneously originated from mutations on chromosomes 5 and 10, that <italic>TGMS-VN1</italic> (Dong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>) and <italic>csa</italic> (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>) were obtained by gamma irradiation on chromosome 5 and chromosome 1, and that <italic>0A15-1</italic> was developed via cell culture on chromosome 3 (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). Recently, P/TGMS lines were successfully directionally cultivated from <italic>TMS5</italic> by genome editing with a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated system (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>), which will allow the elite maintainer lines to be converted into P/TGMS lines effectively. Although CRISPR and P/TGMS allele conversions with the aid of MAS are alternative options in generating new P/TGMS germplasms and driving faster genetic gain in 2-line rice hybrid systems; our approach is less time-consuming and does not involve any genetic transformation process. Thus, it can add value to the exploration of better P/TGMS lines.</p><p id="Par31">Fundamental research on map-based cloning and functional analysis of the <italic>tgms</italic> gene in T98S should also be conducted. Additional applied work on establishing a method of marker-assisted breeding by converting T98S together with screening TGMS plants for a proper fertility alteration temperature should be undertaken in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par32">This paper presents a strategy for generating the TGMS line T98S from the rice maintainer line T98B. T98S inherited the basic genetic background and maintained the elite traits of T98B. T98S male sterility is controlled by a recessive nuclear gene. The strategy reported here is quite user friendly when working with 2-line hybrid system restorer lines for developing hybrid rice with better yield potential. Thus, the strategy of converting a maintainer line into a P/TGMS line is practical for the development of hybrid rice with more desirable heterosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
