    "A maintainer line of 3-line hybrid rice commonly presents a certain genetic distance to a 2-line restorer line, but in many cases, 2-line restorer lines present defects upon recovery of the object cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of the maintainer line, which impedes the utilization of their heterosis. Here, we report a strategy and an example of converting a maintainer into a photoperiod/temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (P/TGMS) line with an almost identical genetic background, thus maximizing the heterosis. Firstly, through treatment of maintainer line T98B with 60CO-γ irradiation, we identified the TGMS line T98S, which is sterile at higher temperatures and fertile at lower temperatures. Secondly, the T98S line was proven to be identical to T98B with regard to genetic background via an examination of 48 parental polymorphous SSR markers and exhibited excellent blossom traits similar to those of T98B, with an extensive forenoon flowering rate of 75.92% and a high exertion rate of 64.59%. Thirdly, in a combination test, three out of six hybrids from T98S crossed with 2-line restorer lines showed a yield increase of 6.70-15.69% for 2 consecutive years. These results demonstrated that the strategy can generate a new P/TGMS line with strong general combining ability (converted from a maintainer line), thus helping to increase the genetic diversity of male sterile heterotic groups."
