    "Melanocytes in hair are located around dermal papilla cells at the tip of the hair follicle. In this study, we examined the melanogenesis of a three-dimensional (3D) hair dermal papilla model treated with natural extracts and electromagnetic fields (EMFs). The 3D model involved dermal papilla-like tissue (DPLT), an aggregation of a mixture of dermal papilla cells, and melanocytes in microwells. Rice bran extract (RBE), an EMF, and RBE/EMF were applied to different DPLT groups. The LDH assay indicated no cell stress in all experimental groups, and detection of tyrosinase activity demonstrated high activity in the RBE/EMF group. Western blot analysis of the RBE, EMF, and RBE/EMF groups revealed increased MITF, TRP-1, and tyrosinase expression. In addition, the mRNA expression of ET-1, laminin, bFGF, β-catenin, MITF, and tyrosinase was increased in the RBE/EMF group, as demonstrated by RT-qPCR analysis. HMB45 and Fontana-Masson immunostaining showed that the RBE/EMF group had the highest melanin content. Therefore, RBE and EMF may be used as a material and therapy, respectively, for the treatment of vitiligo and white hair, through activation of melanogenesis in melanocytes.
