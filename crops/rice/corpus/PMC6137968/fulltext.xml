Chlorophyll is the primary photosynthetic pigment, and functions in the absorption and transformation of light energy into energy-storage molecules, carbohydrates, and oxygen; it is thus fundamental to the survival and reproduction of all living organisms (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Fromme <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In higher plants, defective chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism lead to changes in chlorophyll content and leaf colour.</p><p>Leaf-colour mutants are not only useful as markers in hybrid breeding, but can also be used to study development-related processes such as photosynthesis, chlorophyll metabolism, and chloroplast development, and thus have considerable potential for research and practical application (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In higher plants, variation in leaf colour is conspicuous, and in rice its diverse phenotypes include virescent, albino, stripe, chlorina, stay-green, zebra, and yellow variegated forms (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). A substantial number of leaf-colour genes have been mapped, but only a few have been cloned. The two <italic>CAO</italic> homologous genes in rice, <italic>OsCAO1</italic> and <italic>OsCAO2</italic>, encode a chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> oxygenase, which catalyses the conversion of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> to chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>. Mutation of <italic>OsCAO1</italic> causes a pale-green leaf phenotype (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). <italic>OsChlD</italic>, <italic>OsChlH</italic>, and <italic>OsChlI</italic> encode Mg-chelatase subunits that catalyse the chelation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into protoporphyrin IX. Mutations of these three genes all cause a yellow-green leaf phenotype to different degrees of severity (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Jung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Deng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). <italic>YELLOW-GREEN LEAF 1</italic> (<italic>YGL1</italic>) encodes a chlorophyll synthase that catalyses the esterification of a chlorophyllide to complete the final step of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice. The mutant <italic>ygl1</italic> displays yellow-green leaves in young plants owing to decreased chlorophyll accumulation (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The above-mentioned genes all affect the development of leaf pigmentation by regulating the synthesis and degradation of chlorophyll. Defective chloroplast development can also lead to the formation of leaf-colour mutants. For example, <italic>VIRESCENT 1</italic> (<italic>V1</italic>) encodes a chloroplast protein that regulates chloroplast RNA metabolism and promotes the establishment of the plastid genetic system in rice. <italic>VIRESCENT 2</italic> (<italic>V2</italic>) encodes a novel type of guanylate kinase and is essential for chloroplast development in rice. The <italic>v1</italic> and <italic>v2</italic> mutants each develop chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>VIRESCENT 3</italic> (<italic>V3</italic>) and <italic>STRIPE 1</italic> (<italic>St1</italic>) respectively encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, which is required for chloroplast biogenesis in rice. The <italic>v3</italic> and <italic>st1</italic> mutants show chlorotic leaves in a growth stage-dependent manner under field conditions (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). <italic>OsPPR1</italic> encodes a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, which is essential for chloroplast biogenesis. Antisense transgenic plants display typical chlorophyll-deficient mutant phenotypes of albinism and lethality (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Gothandam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, mutations in genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism and chloroplast development result in abnormal leaf-colour phenotypes.</p><p>The <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the purine nucleotide is crucial for all living organisms. The synthetic pathway is composed of 11 enzymatic steps, leading to the formation of inosinate, and provides the adenine and guanine purines necessary for almost all biochemical processes, including DNA and RNA metabolism, the biosynthetic intermediates ATP and GTP, co-enzymes, and cytokinins, as well as being a vital metabolic regulator in cell signalling (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Atkins, 2002</xref>). Although purine plays an important role in plant growth and development, limited information on the synthetic pathway in plants is available. The Arabidopsis <italic>PURINE BIOSYNTHESIS 4</italic> (<italic>PUR4</italic>) gene encodes a formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase, which is the fourth enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway. The <italic>pur4</italic> mutation is lethal to the male gametophyte and homozygous <italic>pur4</italic> plants cannot be obtained, which indicates that <italic>de novo</italic> purine synthesis is specifically necessary for pollen development (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Berthom&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>CIA1</italic> encodes a Gln phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase 2 (ATase2), which is one of the three ATase isozymes responsible for the first committed step of <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis. The loss-of-function mutant in Arabidopsis and <italic>ATase2</italic>-RNAi transgenic tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) plants show normal green cotyledons but small and albino/pale-green mosaic leaves and reduced chloroplast protein import, which indicates that <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis is important for chloroplast development. In addition, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of purine plays a crucial role in cell division (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). <italic>PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINE-GLYCINE LIGASE</italic> (<italic>PurD</italic>) is the second enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway, and catalyses the conversion of 5&#x02032;-phosphoribosylamine (PRA) to 5&#x02032;-phosphoribosyl-l-glycinamide (GAR) (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Atkins, 2002</xref>). In recent years, the biological function of <italic>PurD</italic> in mycelial growth and the virulence of bacterial strains has been extensively studied. For example, strains of <italic>Gibberella zeae</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Truong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) harbouring mutations in <italic>PurD</italic> show reduced virulence against plants, which indicates that <italic>purD</italic> plays a vital role in the growth and virulence of bacterial strains. However, investigation of the biological functioning of <italic>purD</italic> in plants is incomplete. Previous studies have shown that <italic>purD</italic> is a single-copy and mono-functional enzyme in Arabidopsis, and the gene shows a high degree of conserved homology to <italic>purD</italic> in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Schnorr <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). However, studies on the physiological characteristics and biological function of <italic>purD</italic> in plants are still required.</p><p>In this study, we isolated a <italic>virescent-albino leaf 1</italic> (<italic>val1</italic>) mutant, which exhibits a chlorotic and narrow-leaf phenotype, decreased quantities of chlorophyll and carotenoids over the entire growth period, and abnormal chloroplast development on the albino side of the leaf. Map-based cloning revealed that <italic>VAL1</italic> encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase, the enzyme involved in the second step of the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in chloroplasts. VAL1 plays a crucial role in the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and pigment metabolism. This is the first report to implicate involvement of the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway in the development of leaf pigmentation and in cell division, and provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying chloroplast development, pigment accumulation, and cell division in rice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material</title><p>The rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) <italic>virescent-albino leaf 1</italic> (<italic>val1</italic>) mutant was derived from an ethylmethane sulfonate-treated population of rice &#x02018;Jinhui 10&#x02019;, which was used as the wild-type (WT) strain for phenotypic observations.

The expression patterns of <italic>histone H4</italic> were characterized by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and it was found to be relatively evenly expressed throughout the P1 leaf primordium in the WT, whereas the frequency of cells that expressed <italic>histone H4</italic> was reduced by 29.2% in the <italic>val1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">E</xref>).

These results confirmed that the decreased number of cells was caused by impaired cell proliferation during the early development of primordia.

The content of iP was reduced by 67.9%, whereas that of tZA was increased slightly in the <italic>val1</italic> mutant compared with the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). Taken together, these results supported the contention that the decreased number of cells was caused by impaired cell proliferation, which may have been due to the reduced content of cytokinins during the early development of leaf primordia in the <italic>val1</italic> mutant.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.

In the <italic>val1</italic> mutant, the expression levels of chlorophyll- and photosynthesis-associated genes were significantly reduced, and chloroplast development was defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, similar to the above-mentioned leaf-colour mutants, the green-revertible albino phenotype of the <italic>val1</italic> mutant was caused by disruption of chlorophyll metabolism and chloroplast development. Previous research has indicated that the phenotypes of the majority of green-revertible albino leaf-colour mutants are regulated by temperature and development, or by a combination of the two. For example, the temperature-sensitive seedling-colour mutant <italic>tsc-1</italic> displays a white, light-yellow, and normal green leaf when grown at 23.1 &#x000b0;C, 26.1 &#x000b0;C, and 30.1 &#x000b0;C, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Dong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In contrast, the albino leaf phenotype of the <italic>val1</italic> mutant at the early seedling stage was not affected by temperature, which indicated that <italic>val1</italic> is a temperature-insensitive mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Developmentally regulated mutants, such as the <italic>ysa</italic> mutant, develop albino leaves before the three-leaf (L3) stage and gradually turn green and recover to the normal green leaf colour at the six-leaf stage (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Su <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The temperature-conditional and developmentally-regulated mutants <italic>v3</italic> and <italic>st1</italic> largely exhibit a normal green-leaf phenotype up to the L3 stage and develop chlorotic leaves until the maximum tiller stage, but recover to develop mostly green leaves after heading. At temperatures of 20 &#x000b0;C or 30 &#x000b0;C, these mutants produce chlorotic leaves, whereas under an alternate light/dark cycle (12 h light at 30 &#x000b0;C/12 h dark at 20 &#x000b0;C), these mutants develop leaves of an almost normal green colour (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Yoo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In our present study, the <italic>val1</italic> mutant initially produced albino new leaves, but these subsequently turned green and only a small number of leaves showed marginal albinism at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The results indicated that <italic>val1</italic> is a novel green-revertible albino mutant, for which the phenotype is regulated by development and is independent of temperature.</p><p>Nucleotide metabolism is a crucial process in all living organisms (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Atkins, 2002</xref>). Although the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of purine nucleotides is essential for plant growth and development, little information is available on the molecular mechanism of the purine biosynthesis pathway in plants. The Arabidopsis gene <italic>CIA1</italic> encodes a Gln phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase 2 (ATase2), which is one of three ATase isozymes responsible for the first step of <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis. The <italic>cia1</italic> mutant displays normal green cotyledons, together with small and albino/pale-green mosaic leaves that contain slightly smaller cells but only half the cell number of the WT, which indicates that <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis is important for chloroplast biogenesis and cell division (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Our present study showed that <italic>VAL1</italic> encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase, the second enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway. In the <italic>val1</italic> mutant, chloroplast development was severely defective and chlorophyll metabolism was disrupted, which resulted in the dynamic green-revertible albino leaf phenotype. Taken together, the findings indicated that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme that regulates the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway, which may be involved in the development of leaf colour in rice. In addition, the <italic>val1</italic> mutant developed narrow leaves, caused by diminished cell division owing to the reduced content of cytokinins in the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), and led to a reduced number of vascular bundles and fewer cells between the small vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway may also be involved in the process of cell division in rice. The location of the pathway within plant cells is presently still in dispute, although the subcellular localization of multiple enzymes provides convincing evidence (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Atkins, 2002</xref>). Our current study showed that VAL1 contained a chloroplast transit peptide and was localized in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), which indicated that at least part of the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts in rice.</p><p>It is worth considering why the mutation of <italic>VAL1</italic> caused a dynamic green-revertible albino phenotype. One hypothesis is that VAL1 paralogs might perform the same or similar functions at later growth stages, and eventually offset the loss caused by mutation in the <italic>VAL1</italic> gene. This explanation was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. There was one <italic>VAL1</italic>-like gene, <italic>LOC_Os12g09540</italic>, which showed high similarity to VAL1 at the amino acid level (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>), and <italic>LOC_Os12g09540</italic> was also highly expressed in leaves, with the highest levels detected in L3U (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. S3A, B</xref>). One reasonable interpretation is that there is a threshold level of purine nucleotides that needs to be met for normal chloroplast biogenesis and chlorophyll metabolism. Under rapid growth conditions, purine nucleotides are channelled into cell division, the purine nucleotide level in the mutant drops below the threshold, and chloroplasts fail to develop normally, causing the mutant to display albino leaves. When the division and growth rate of leaf cells are slower, purine nucleotides have time to accumulate in the mutant cells, eventually reaching the threshold level, and the mutant leaves subsequently turn green in the later stages. In <italic>val1</italic> seedlings, the contents of the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis products adenine nucleotide (AMP) and guanine nucleotide (GMP) were lower than those of the WT seedlings (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), which indicated that the purine nucleotide level in the mutant dropped below the threshold. Furthermore, in the <italic>val1</italic> mutant, application of AMP, GMP, and AMP and GMP together partially restored the accumulation of chlorophyll in the <italic>val1</italic> mutant (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that the dynamic green-revertible albino process may be regulated by the threshold level of purine nucleotides. In addition, purine nucleotides are maintained in intracellular pools through a combination of <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis and salvage pathways (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Zrenner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the strong demand for nucleotides in growing and dividing cells is met by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, whereas non-growing cells may be able to maintain their pools of nucleotides by salvaging (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ashihara and Crozier, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Zrenner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). <italic>VAL1</italic> achieved the highest expression levels in the WT leaves at the L3 stage, and accumulated more in L3L but decreased dramatically in L3U (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These observations suggested that VAL1 might play an important role at the early leaf development stage, with a relatively minor role in the mature leaf. Thus, another reasonable interpretation is that the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis process regulates chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism at the early leaf development stage, and the salvage pathway regulates chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism in mature leaves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s28"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
