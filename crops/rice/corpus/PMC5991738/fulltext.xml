We are interested in understanding hormonal regulation of floret opening and closure in plants. This is a particularly important problem for hybrid rice because regulation of flowering time is vitally important in hybrid rice seed production. However, little was known about the effects of plant hormones on rice flowering. We have shown that jasmonate and methyl jasmonate play significant roles in promoting rice floret opening. In this study, we investigated the effects of auxins including indole-3-acidic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 1-naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (DIC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on floret closure of four fertile and three sterile varieties of rice. The results from field studies in three growing seasons in 2013&#x02013;2015 showed that the percentages of closed florets were significantly lower in plants treated with IAA, IBA, 2,4-D, DIC and NAA and that the durations of floret opening were significantly longer in plants treated with the same auxins. The auxins exhibited time- and concentration-dependant effects on floret closure. ABA displayed opposite effects of auxins because it increased the percentages of floret closure and decreased the length of floret opening of rice varieties. The degree of auxin-inhibiting and ABA-promoting effects on floret closure was varied somewhat but not significantly different among the rice varieties. Endogenous IAA levels were the highest in florets collected shortly before opening followed by a sharp decline in florets with maximal angles of opening and a significant jump of IAA levels shortly after floret closure in both fertile and sterile rice plants. ABA levels showed an opposite trend in the same samples. Our results showed that auxins delayed but ABA promoted the closure of rice floret regardless of the varieties.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Science and Technology Projects for Universities in Jiangxi Province, China</institution></funding-source><award-id>KJLD12092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>the Project of Gan Po Excellence 555 Plan of Jiangxi Province</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>USDA-ARS Quality and Utilization of Agricultural Products Research Program 306</institution></funding-source><award-id>6054-41000-103-00D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0958-1468</contrib-id><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Heping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Science and Technology Projects for Universities in Jiangxi Province, China (KJLD12092), the Project of Gan Po Excellence 555 Plan of Jiangxi Province, China and USDA-ARS Quality and Utilization of Agricultural Products Research Program 306 through CRIS 6054-41000-103-00D.

For example, brassinosteroids regulate rice lamina joint inclination due to uneven expansion of the cells in the joint [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Gibberellins (GAs) regulate the amount of starch and structural polysaccharides in maize endosperm suspension cells via regulating enzyme activities involved in carbohydrate metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

This is a particularly important problem for hybrid rice because regulation of flowering time is vitally important in hybrid rice seed production. Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) flowering is a developmental process involved in multiple steps including inflorescence initiation, development of the flower structure, panicle extrusion (heading) and flower opening (anthesis). In this study, rice flowering is narrowly defined as anthesis for simplicity of description and refers to the opening and closing of the floret which takes 6&#x02013;10 days for the tens-hundreds of florets within the same panicle to complete flowering [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rice flowering time occurs at a certain time of the day and varies among different varieties and under different weather conditions. Fertile rice varieties normally start flowering at 9&#x02013;10 am of the day and last for 1&#x02013;2 h. However, the flowers of sterile rice varieties open later, take longer time to close and last 4&#x02013;8 h [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The extended flowering times for the sterile rice expose them to a number of disadvantages, such as abnormal development of ovaries [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], susceptible to rice kernel smut [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and increasing the percentage of glume-gaping grains up to 12&#x02013;61% [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These disadvantages hinder the production of hybrid rice because they greatly affect the quality and quantity of hybrid seeds. However, little was known about the effects of plant hormones on rice flowering.</p><p>Plant hormone jasmonates including jasmonate (JA) and its methyl ester, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are important regulators of plant reproductive development [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

This discovery led to new technology development for regulating flowering time during hybrid rice seed production [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, much less was known about the regulation of floret closure by plant hormones. In this study, we investigated the regulation of floret closure of fertile rice and sterile rice by auxins including IAA, indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 1-naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (Dicamba or DIC) and ABA.

These rice varieties included indica rice (Huang-yue-zhan, Ping-hui-141, Wu-feng-A, Zhong-9A), indica hybrid rice (Jin-you-gui-99), japonica rice (Bo-you-A) and japonica hybrid rice (Jia-zao-211). All plants but Jia-zao-211 were planted on the experimental field at Yichun University and Jia-zao-211 was planted at the Science and Technology Park of Jiangxi Agricultural University. The plants were grown under natural climate conditions. The rice plants grown in Yichun City, Jiangxi Province has the following geographical coordinates (27&#x000b0;33&#x02032;&#x02014;29&#x000b0;06&#x02032;N, 113&#x000b0;54&#x02032;&#x02014;116&#x000b0;27&#x02032;E). The annual average temperature, sunlight, and water fall was 17.2&#x000b0;C, 1737.1 h, and 1680.2 mm, respectively. Field experiments were conducted in three growing seasons from May to September in 2013&#x02013;2015 and the heading to flowering period was approximately one week in July of each year. This investigation was a pioneer study of the regulation of floret closure in rice by auxins and ABA. Our initial emphasis was to explore as many varieties as possible to confirm our original observation on the hormonal regulation of rice floret closure. There were some variations of the effects of hormones on rice floret closure but no significant difference was observed among the different varieties.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Plant hormones and their synthetic analogs used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma.

IAA, IBA, 2,4-D and DIC were used at four concentrations (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/L). ABA concentrations at 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/L corresponded to &#x02248; 0.19, 0.38, 0.76, 1.52, and 3.0 mM, respectively.

Rice plants with similar growth and development stages were sprayed the chemicals at 500 mL/5m<sup>2</sup> approximately one hour before floret opening under clear sky conditions. The treatments were not performed in the same day among the different varieties. Instead, they were treated according to flower development. The selection of treatment time was based on the development of anther and the top floret opening the day before. Specifically, treatment &#x0201c;one hour before floret opening&#x0201d; was determined by field observation of flower development several days prior to the treatment based on the height of anther in the flower and the opening time of the top floret the day before. The concentrations of plant hormones used in this study at the &#x003bc;M-mM levels were based on previous studies for cereals [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The dissected florets were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored in an ultralow freezer. Each sample weighed 2 g and each treatment was repeated three times. The frozen tissue (0.9&#x02013;1.1 g) was ground into a fine powder with a pre-cold mortar and pestle for 5 min in 2 mL of 80% ethanol. The powder was transferred into a 10 mL centrifuge tube. The mortar was washed with 2 mL of 80% ethanol twice and pooled in the same centrifuge tube which was left for extraction at 4&#x000b0;C for 4 h or overnight followed by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min.

These auxins were initially tested for their effects on floret closure of rice variety Jia-zao-211. Rice plants were selected for the tests based on the facts that those plants had several florets on the upper part of the plants already flowered and that the middle part of the plants were judged to be flowered massively the day before the treatment. The number of closed florets was counted every 30 min after the first floret closure until the last floret was closed. The length of floret closure was recorded with 50 florets per plant. The percentages of closed florets were clearly lower in plants treated with IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198828.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), IBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198828.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), 2,4-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198828.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and DIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0198828.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) compared to the control, especially 40- and 70-min after the first floret closure.

To our knowledge, this is the first report related to the effects of the five classical plant hormones on rice floret closure. In previous studies, treatment with plant hormone MeJA delayed wheat floret closure for 42&#x02013;70 min [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Salicylic acid (SA), another plant hormone, doubled the percentage of glume-gaping grains of sterile wheat after the floret opening was induced by MeJA [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. ABA was shown to promote floret opening in <italic>Ipomoea nil</italic> and IAA was shown to inhibit floret opening in <italic>Pharbitis nil</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We performed similar experiments but we did not observe significant effect of ABA and IAA on floret opening in rice (data not shown). These suggest that the mechanisms of hormonal regulated floret opening in <italic>Ipomoea nil</italic> and <italic>Pharbitis nil</italic> are different from those in rice and wheat. The different responses of rice and the other species to the same hormonal regulation might be due to the different structures of florets in these two groups of species, in which rice floret opening is caused by the expansion of basal lodicules whereas the other two species do not have similar floral structure. Alternatively, although we thought unlikely, the different observation in these two plant species was due to much higher concentrations of ABA and auxins used in our studies than those used in the previous study.</p><p>Our study also showed that the endogenous levels of IAA were significantly decreased but those of ABA were increased in florets with maximal openings, although the levels of these hormones in fertile rice were much higher than those in sterile rice. These findings are similar to those of floret closing effects caused by exogenously applied auxins and ABA. Uchiumi and Okamoto [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that IAA levels went up after pollination in rice fruit. They further showed that IAA levels in ovaries were lower than those in rachilla-pedicel before anthesis, became similar in the two tissues 3&#x02013;6 h after flowering, and turned higher one day after flowering. Our results showed that IAA levels went up from floret closing to complete closure, probably due to similar pollination effect. However, it is not clear why the sterile varieties showed reduced levels of IAA and ABA compared with those of fertile lines.</p><p>Rice floret opening and closure is proposed to be caused by turgor pressure movement like guard cells [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well-known that ABA regulates turgor pressure in stomata guard cells, causes water loss in the cells and promote stomata closure in leaves. We therefore speculate that the mechanism of ABA-promoted floret closure is similar to that of the stomata closure. It is generally accepted that auxins increase water uptake and cell expansion. Therefore, floret closing in rice delayed by auxins might be due to auxin effects on promoting water uptake and/or preventing water loss in floret cells. More direct evidence is required to demonstrate the mechanism of rice floret opening and closing by auxin and ABA.</p><p>Currently, there is limited knowledge about the mechanism and regulation of floret opening and closing. It is generally believed that floret opening is due to water uptake which causes cell expansion in lodicule. After floret flowering, water loss in lodicule causes shrinkage in the tissue and pushes inferior lemma towards palea and eventually results in the closing of floret. Water loss in lodicule is caused by active export of water and solutes from the tissue to rachilla. The reasons for the slower floret closure in sterile rice are probably due to fewer number of vascular tissues and poorer development of the transportation system [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. After spikelet opening, lodicule is exposed out of inferior lemma and palea. Under microscopy, the outer cell wall of the epidemic cells in lodicule apparently becomes thick, reaches approximately 3&#x02013;5 fold of thickness of those in the parenchyma cell walls and becomes a waterproof layer. The fact that floret closing is not affected by atmospheric moisture suggests that floret closing is not due to loss of water on the surface of epidermis [<xref rid="pone.0198828.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>No prior research had shown what initiates floret closing. Based on this study, we speculate that when floret opening reaches the maximal angle, the decrease of endogenous IAA levels and increase of endogenous ABA levels initiate the transition from opening to closing of florets. This study provides insights towards better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of floret closing in rice. Because of the stimulation of floret closing by ABA, it is potentially important to increase the yield and improve the quality of hybrid seed by shortening the length of floret opening. It is worth of keeping in mind that this study only studied the endogenous IAA and ABA levels in the whole flowers due to limited availability of locidule tissues. Further study on IAA and ABA content in locidule tissues is needed to illustrate the mechanism of hormonal regulation of floret closing in rice.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ABA</term><def><p>abscisic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAA</term><def><p>indole-3-acidic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBA</term><def><p>indole-3-butyric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JA</term><def><p>jasmonate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MeJA</term><def><p>methyl jasmonate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NAA</term><def><p>1-naphthalene-acetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>2,4-D</term><def><p>2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIC</term><def><p>3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SA</term><def><p>salicylic acid</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0198828.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name> (<year>1995</year>) <article-title>Brassinosteroid-induced rice lamina joint inclination and its relation to indole-3-acetic acid and ethylene</article-title>. <source>Plant Growth Regul</source>
