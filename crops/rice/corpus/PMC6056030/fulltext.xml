Cu plays essential roles in many biological processes, such as in photosynthesis, respiratory electron-transport chains, oxidative stress protection, hormone signaling and cell wall metabolism. Cu also acts as a structural element in regulatory proteins and cofactors in many enzymes including cytochrome c oxidaxidase, plastocyanin, superoxide dismutase, and amino oxidase [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cu deficiency in plants induces certain symptoms, such as plant chlorosis (especially in young leaves), defects in cell wall formation and lignification which causes insufficient water transport, and defective pollen development and viability [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In biochemical reactions, the utility of Cu depends on the cycle between oxidized Cu (II) and reduced Cu (I) states in enzymes and electron carriers [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, when Cu is in excess, cycling between Cu (I) and Cu (II) can produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals which subsequently damage macromolecules [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, maintaining the homeostasis of Cu, in which Cu transporters play a pivotal role, is vital for normal plant development.</p><p>A number of different types of transporter proteins that can mediate Cu uptake have been reported; the two major transporters are Ctr/COPT-type Cu transporters and P-type heavy metal ATPases [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ctr/COPT proteins not only contain multiple protein families in different organisms, they are also highly specific Cu transporters compared with the P-type heavy metal ATPases which can transport a series of ions, such as Cu<sup>+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, etc. [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Results from metal competition experiments have shown that Ctr/COPT proteins predominantly transport Cu (I) (and the isoelectric Ag<sup>+</sup>) but not Cu (II) [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The dominant form of Cu in soils is Cu (ll) which can be reduced to Cu (I) in the proximal vicinity of the cell and supply Cu (I) to the putative Cu transporter in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ctr/COPT family members contain three putative transmembrane-spanning domains (TM1-3), an amino-terminal region rich in methionine residues and a carboxy -terminal region rich in cysteine. Among these, TM2 and TM3 are reported to be strictly conserved in Ctr/COPT protein members [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There are important signal motifs MxxxM of TM2 and GxxxG of TM3. Especially, methionine residues in the MxxxM motif are essential for Cu transport activity [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on previous investigations, a structural model has been proposed for Ctr/COPT mediated process of Cu transport. Firstly, the extracellular M-rich motif in the amino-terminal region of the Ctr/COPT protein sequesters Cu (I) to the entrance of the pore, a channel for passage of Cu across the lipid bilayer composed of a set of stacked methionine triads. After passing through the pore, Cu (I) binds to carboxy-terminal Cys-rich motifs, and is then delivered to membrane-associated metallochaperones for targeted distribution [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The first Ctr/COPT protein identified in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> was yCtr1 (ScCtr1), which affected high-affinity Cu uptake [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; the next two proteins were yCtr2 (ScCtr2) (a low-affinity Cu transporter) and yCtr3 (ScCtr3) (a high-affinity Cu transporter)[<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Various yeast Cu transporter mutants, such as ctr1&#x022bf;mutant, <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr2</italic>&#x022bf; mutant and <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr3</italic>&#x022bf; mutant, have widely been used in heterologous functional complementary system to identify Cu transporters from other species [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Among these, COPTs have only been functionally examined in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtCOPT1, AtCOPT2 and AtCOPT6 could fully restore the growth defects of the yeast <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr3</italic>&#x022bf; double-mutant strain; AtCOPT3 and AtCOPT5 could only restore growth defects to a modest level. However, AtCOPT4, which defected in the MxxxM motif of TM2, could not complement the growth defect of the same mutant strain [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In rice, two kinds of Ctr/COPT-type Cu transporters exist: high-affinity and low-affinity Cu transporters. OsCOPT7 is the only protein which can mediate high-affinity Cu transport by itself [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides, OsCOPT2, OsCOPT3, or OsCOPT4 can cooperate with OsCOPT6 individually by forming heterologous dimers or polymers tomediate high-affinity Cu uptake. On the other hand, OsCOPT3, OsCOPT4 or OsCOPT6 can mediate low-affinity Cu transport by themselves [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, expression of OsCOPT1, OsCOPT5 or XA13, a susceptible protein to pathogenic bacterium <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae pv</italic>. <italic>Oryzae</italic> (Xoo), alone or coexpression of any two of the three proteins could not complement the phenotype of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> mutant unless coexpression of all of the three proteins [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Base on sequence homology, two putative Cu transporters have been mentioned in maize, one of three major global food crops [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, detailed information about the functions of these transporters has not been reported. In our study, we identified and characterized three Ctr/COPT-type Cu transporter genes in maize. The genetic assumption of their ability to transport Cu was performed by functionally complementing the growth defects of the yeast mutant <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr2</italic>&#x022bf;. Cu uptake assays have also demonstrated these Cu transporters have specificity in Cu absorption. Moreover, the expression profile of maize Cu transporters in different tissues and under different Cu concentrations supports further evidence that these transporters are related to Cu transportation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant growth and treatment</title><p>Seeds of the maize inbred line 178 were surface-sterilized in 0.5% (w/v) NaOCl for 15 min and then 75% (w/v) ethanol for 2 min before being germinated for 3 d at room temperature on paper soaked with distilled water.

Although <italic>COPT</italic> genes encoding Cu transporter proteins have been identified in several plant species, their function has only been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of three members of the <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> gene family in maize.</p><p>ZmCOPTs share a conserved structure with Cu transporter homologs from rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. For example, each ZmCOPT contains three TMs and the conserved residues were largely restricted to the three TMs, giving the clue of functional conservation of these ZmCOPTs. In addition, as each TM2 of the <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes contains the MxxxM motif, this suggests ZmCOPTs are potential Cu transporters. The MxxxM motif is essential for Cu uptake and may coordinate Cu during intramembraneous transport [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Substitution of the methionine of TM2 with alanine or serine in yCtr and hCtr proteins resulted in the proteins losing the ability to transport Cu [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. And AtCOPT4 protein which does not possess the MxxxM motif is also incapable of restoring the growth defect of <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr3</italic>&#x022bf; mutant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, all three ZmCOPTs have the Met-rich motif in their amino-terminal which can sequester Cu (I) to the Cu transport channel, but the number of this motif varied. ZmCOPT1 and ZmCOPT2 also contain the Cys-rich motif, a motif which controls the release of Cu into the cytoplasm; this motif is not present in ZmCOPT3. In addition, GTAC motif and the AT-rich element found in the promoter region of ZmCOPT2 were related to Cu transport [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These conserved structural features of ZmCOPTs strongly suggest a functional involvement in Cu transport; variation however may occur among the ZmCOPTs to enable them to adapt to fluctuating environmental variation of Cu. The fact that ZmCOPTs clustered together with COPTs originating from plants in the same group of the phylogenetic tree provides further proof that ZmCOPTs are Cu transporters.</p><p>Generally, the expression pattern of a gene is closely correlated with its function. In our investigation, the three <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes had displayed a constitutively expression pattern in all of the detected tissues, but the expression level are not the same for all organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199081.g003">Fig 3</xref>), suggesting that maybe each ZmCOPT has its function in a specific part of the plant. This expression pattern has also been reported for the COPT transporters in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (except <italic>AtCOPT6</italic>), rice and grapevine [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. On the other hand, Zm<italic>COPT</italic> genes had a distinct response under Cu stress conditions. For example, the expression of <italic>ZmCOPT1</italic> in shoots and <italic>ZmCOPT2</italic> in shoots and roots was induced by a deficiency of Cu and suppressed with an excess of Cu; <italic>ZmCOPT3</italic> was induced in both shoots and roots regardless of Cu-deficient or Cu-excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199081.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the same case, the expression of <italic>AtCOPT2</italic> was induced under Cu-deficient conditions and the expression of <italic>AtCOPT1</italic> and <italic>AtCOPT2</italic> were suppressed with an excess of Cu [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. And the expression of <italic>OsCOPT1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>5</italic> and <italic>7</italic> was induced under Cu-deficient conditions and suppressed with an excess of Cu in rice [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An exploring with promoter-fused GUS in plant under Cu deficiency (using Cu chelator) could give more information of the expression pattern of <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes.</p><p>Previous investigations have reported that a series of Ctr/COPT-type Cu transporters can complement the phenotype of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisia</italic>e <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr3</italic>&#x022bf; mutant, these include mCtr1 of mice [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], hCtr1 of humans [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], AtCOPT1, 2, 3, and 5 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and OsCOPT7 of rice [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our investigation, all of the three maize <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes also demonstrated their function in Cu transport by genetic complementation of the <italic>ctr1</italic>&#x022bf;<italic>ctr2</italic>&#x022bf; mutant. Measurement of Cu content in the corresponding transformed mutant strains was in accordance with the function of ZmCOPTs in Cu transport and the complementation test (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199081.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199081.g005">5</xref>). On the contrary, the growth of <italic>ZmCOPTs</italic>-transformed wild type strain was inhibited by excess Cu, the result is similar to the severe growth retardation of yeast strains transformed with the Cu transporter gene <italic>TaCT1</italic> in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], thus providing additional supporting evidence for the ability of ZmCOPT for Cu transport.</p><p>Interestingly, the growth rate of <italic>ZmCOPT3</italic>-transformed mutant strains was considerably lower than that of <italic>ZmCOPT1</italic>- or <italic>ZmCOPT2</italic>-transformed mutant strains, whether in solid or liquid media, suggesting a different affinity of these ZmCOPTs in the process of Cu transport: ZmCOPT1 and ZmCOPT2 had high-affinity and ZmCOPT3 had low-affinity. This finding seems to be partially attributed to the variation in number of Met-rich motifs in the amino-terminal of the ZmCOPTs. High-affinity Cu transporters with two Met-rich motifs had a higher ability for Cu transport than those with one [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. And deletion of the eight Met-rich motifs of yCtr1 decreased copper uptake rate by one-third compared with the wild type [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our study, the high-affinity Cu transporter ZmCOPT2 which had two Met-rich motifs in the amino-terminal seemed transport more Cu than ZmCOPT1, which only had one Met-rich motif, according to the growth inhibition. However, Met-rich motifs could not be used as a measuring criterion of the affinity of Cu transporters. Otherwise, <italic>ZmCOPT3</italic>-transformed wild type and mutant strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> would have a higher Cu transport ability or Cu content than <italic>ZmCOPT1</italic>-transformed. Actually, ZmCOPT3 (with two Met-rich motifs) had the weakest ability to transport Cu among the three ZmCOPTs. Similarly, the high-affinity Cu transporter yCtr3 contains no Met-rich motifs and OsCOPT7 has one motif in the amino-terminal; low-affinity Cu transporters OsCOPT3 and OsCOPT4 have three motifs [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Results for phylogenetic analysis showed that ZmCOPT1 was more related to rice OsCOPT7, this being the only gene which could mediate high-affinity copper transporter alone; ZmCOPT2 was more related to rice OsCOPT2, which could cooperate with OsCOPT6 to mediate high-affinity Cu uptake and ZmCOPT3 is more related to rice OsCOPT3 and OsCOPT4, which could mediate low-affinity Cu transport in rice [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As to the low-affinity of ZmCOPT3, at least two factors should be taken into account. Firstly, because the Cys-rich motif in the carboxy-terminal of yeast Ctr1 is dispensable for high affinity uptake, the lack of the Cys-rich motif in carboxy-terminal region of ZmCOPT3 suggests that this does not affect its low-affinity to Cu. Secondly, <italic>ZmCOPT3</italic> has the special up-regulated expression pattern whether subjected to Cu-deficiency or Cu-excess stress, perhaps caused by a lack of regulation domain (the Cys-rich motif) in the carboxy-terminal which prevents excessive uptake of Cu [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These factors, together with the low-affinity of Cu transport of ZmCOPT3, suggested that it may play a role in basal level Cu transport in a fluctuating environment. Otherwise, <italic>ZmCOPT3</italic> might be controlled by the feedback regulation of biological requirement in maize.</p><p>Furthermore, the ZmCOPT2 protein is a high-affinity transporter with specificity for Cu (I), but not for other bivalent ions, such as Mn or Zn, similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> COPT1 and other Ctr1 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199081.g006">Fig 6</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].Moreover, like hCtr1, ZmCOPT2 could also transport Ag due to similar isoelectronic structure of Ag (I) and Cu (I) which can cause competition [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0199081.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. So far, COPT/Ctr proteins function specifically in Cu transport. Though the endogenous iron, manganese, or zinc may influence Cu homeostasis by influencing the expression of COPTs in rice, none of them could restore the Fe- or Zn-uptake functions of the yeast mutants [<xref rid="pone.0199081.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, just like other COPTs, whether or not, the ZmCOPT1 and ZmCOPT3 also show specificity in Cu transport, is required further study to determine. Meanwhile, the direct assessment of Cu content in the ZmCOPTs-transformed yeast cells and conduction the subcellular location study in plant cells and promoter analysis in plant system would also be powerful to explain the Cu transport ability of the ZmCOPTs in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, our investigation identified three ZmCOPT transporters and suggested that <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes may play essential roles in the uptake and translocation of Cu and that they respond to fluctuating environmental levels of Cu. However, the precise roles of individual <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes require further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>The nucleotide sequences of the three <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>The nucleotides of the promoter sequence of the three <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title><italic>Ctr/COPT</italic> genes identified in some species.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The <italic>cis</italic>-element of the promoter sequence of <italic>ZmCOPTs</italic> is predicted by database PlantCARE.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>PCR primers used for the semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the real-time quantitative PCR.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>PCR primers used for complete CDS amplification.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s007"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>PCR primers used for <italic>ctr1&#x022bf;ctr2&#x022bf;S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> mutant complementation assays.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s008"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The predicted TM regions of the three ZmCOPT proteins.</title><p>The TM regions of the ZmCOPT proteins were predicted using TMHMM2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM</ext-link>) 2.0: the red peaks indicate the predicted transmembrane domains of the proteins.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s008.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s009"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of the Ctr/COPT family proteins constructed by using Mega 5.0.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0199081.s009.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0199081.s010"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>PCR amplification of the entire ORFs of the three <italic>ZmCOPT</italic> genes.</title><p>Root or leaf cDNA was used as the template.
