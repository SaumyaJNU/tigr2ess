and three-wheeled auto rickshaws at some of the busiest intersections
in India&#x02019;s capital of Delhi sit refrigerator-sized machines
hopelessly chugging away. They
suck in the brew of pollutants belched from the vehicles and pump out fresh air.</p><p>The machines, installed at 54
intersections this past autumn by
the federal Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), pass air through
three filters to remove particulates and dust. Ultraviolet lamps sitting in an inner chamber trigger photocatalyst-coated charcoal particles to oxidize small, toxic organic compounds that make it past the filters, transforming them into, relatively speaking, innocuous carbon dioxide and
water. The machine&#x02019;s developers at the Council of Scientific &#x00026;
Industrial Research&#x02019;s <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neeri.res.in">National Environmental Engineering Research Institute</ext-link> say
a single filtration machine can purify air over an area of 500 m<sup>2</sup> and that larger devices capable of covering 10,000 m<sup>2</sup> are in the works.</p><p>Critics aren&#x02019;t so sure about the machines or the 26 million Indian rupees (about $370,000) that they cost. &#x0201c;Their effectiveness outdoors
is questionable,&#x0201d; says Polash Mukerjee, a senior researcher
with the Delhi-based <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cseindia.org">Centre
for Science and Environment</ext-link>. The quoted areas over which they can purify air are based on lab measurements, rather than real-world ones, he contends. &#x0201c;They do work, but
the area of impact is very limited. In an ambient outdoor atmosphere,
it could be 2&#x02013;3 m<sup>2</sup> around the machine.&#x0201d;</p><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2019-00009b_0001" id="GRAPHIC-d7e91-autogenerated" position="float"><caption><p>Air pollution in Delhi is the worst among the world&#x02019;s largest
cities, according to the World Health Organization. Credit: Saurov022/Shutterstock.</p></caption></graphic><p>But even if the machines clean the area they are
supposed to, the pollutants they would remove would
be a blip in the haze enveloping Delhi, rated by the World Health Organization as the
most polluted of the world&#x02019;s large cities. Average levels of
the most dangerous airborne particles&#x02014;those less than 2.5 &#x003bc;m in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>)&#x02014;are 14 times as high as the WHO&#x02019;s recommended limit. And on its current
trajectory, the city&#x02019;s massive pollution problem is going to only get worse. Already straining at the seams with a population of 29 million, Delhi
is on target to pass Tokyo to become the world&#x02019;s largest city
by 2028, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Pollution in Delhi spikes in the winter, owing to a mix of cultural practices involving burning and meteorological factors. A thick, noxious
mix of smog
and dust obscures the sun and chokes lungs, forcing schools to close
and citizens who can afford breathing masks to don them. Under pressure
to do something, the CPCB is testing a few other technologies this
winter in addition to filters at intersections. Thirty smaller air
filters have been placed atop public buses. The CPCB also plans to sprinkle
magnesium chloride and cement powder on roads and construction sites; these
hygroscopic materials absorb water from the air, making the ground
moist and keeping dust from flying up. And in late November, the agency
announced a cloud-seeding project that, according to those in charge, should generate artificial rain
to wash away pollution.</p><p>&#x0201c;These are Band-Aid solutions,
not permanent or sustainable
solutions,&#x0201d; says Sandeep Dahiya, campaign manager at the grassroots
advocacy group <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://helpdelhibreathe.in">Help Delhi
Breathe</ext-link>. &#x0201c;Just political stunts to show that the
central government is trying something.&#x0201d;</p><p>Instead of expensive
machines that try to clean heavily polluted
air, what the city needs is a sound, long-term plan to curb pollution
at its source, he and others say. But that might prove harder
to do in Delhi than anywhere else in the world. Megacities like Beijing,
Cairo, Los Angeles, and Mexico City all face pollution challenges.
Like those cities, pollution comes
from several sources and varies by season and meteorological conditions.
In Delhi, though, this problem is compounded by an exploding growth in population and a lack of information, education, sound policies,
and law enforcement. Antipollution measures have so far fizzled, but solutions are simple and obvious, experts say, and
much boils down to political and social will.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>What&#x02019;s in the Air?</title><p>The eye-stinging pollution that Delhi residents try to keep out
of their throats with breathing masks is a mix of gases and tiny particulates.
Most of it comes from various types of burning: the biggest sources
are exhaust from power plants and transportation, smoke from innumerable
fires that rural inhabitants and poor city dwellers burn for warmth
and cooking, piles of refuse burned on curbsides for easy disposal,
and methane-triggered landfill fires. This burning spews a toxic brew
of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide
gases.</p><p>Particles&#x02014;both PM<sub>2.5</sub> and those less than 10 &#x003bc;m in
diameter known
as PM<sub>10</sub>&#x02014;are the biggest health concern because they can penetrate
the lungs and cardiovascular system. The smaller, PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles are especially
deadly, increasing the risk of asthma, heart disease, strokes, and
lung cancer. Dust kicked up on roads and from construction sites adds
particles to the load generated from burning. About 30,000 deaths
every year in Delhi are due to air pollution, according to Help Delhi
Breathe, making it the fifth leading cause of death in India.</p><p>The first step in effectively curbing pollution is to understand
how much comes from where, experts say. But this task is difficult in India because
official numbers are rife with error and it is impossible to count
smaller sources of pollution such as fires set by individuals. A <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.teriin.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/Exec-summary.pdf">government-funded report</ext-link> released in August 2018 by the
Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and the Automotive Research
Association of India provided the most comprehensive analysis to date
but used chemical analysis of air samples combined with modeling to
apportion pollution to its sources. The study is the &#x0201c;first
to use two different modeling approaches, which derive the same conclusions,&#x0201d;
says <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.teriin.org/profile/sumit-sharma">Sumit
Sharma</ext-link>, director of earth science and climate change at
TERI.</p><p>In one approach, the team collected particulate samples
at 20 locations&#x02014;9 in the city and 11 in neighboring states (collectively
called the National Capital Region)&#x02014;during one winter and one
summer in 2016&#x02013;17. The researchers analyzed the samples and categorized
their compositions into species like ions, metals, and carbon compounds,
and then used computer simulations to trace them to sources like transportation
exhaust, power plant emissions, road dust, and diesel generators.</p><p>The other approach involved starting with various sources of particulates
in the National Capital Region, as well as pollutants transported
from outside, and then using meteorological and chemical modeling to simulate how they would disperse and react. Comparing the results
with pollution measurements allowed the team to determine the most likely
profile of sources.</p><p>Both approaches show that, in the winter,
vehicles are responsible
for about 30% of Delhi&#x02019;s PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution. Industries, including
power plants, contribute about 30%; the burning of biomass in kitchens
and agricultural fields results in 14&#x02013;23%; and dust kicked
up by vehicles and from the region&#x02019;s unchecked construction
boom contributes another 17%. During the summer, the transportation sector&#x02019;s
share of particulate pollution goes down considerably while that of
dust doubles.</p><p>Total particulate levels rise as winter approaches. In the cool
season, farmers in Delhi&#x02019;s neighboring agricultural states
of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh burn crop residue such as rice or wheat stalks before reseeding
their fields, and millions of people set off fireworks for several
days for the Hindu festival of Diwali, which falls in October or November. Conditions peak in the winter
when cold-air inversions trap particulates close to the ground, and lower
wind speeds deposit dust from Gulf countries and neighboring Afghanistan,
adding to northern India&#x02019;s dust. Average winter concentrations
of both PM<sub>2.5</sub> (168 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) and PM<sub>10</sub> (314 &#x003bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>) are double those in the summer.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>The Path to Bluer Skies</title><p>Under public pressure, government officials are starting to act.
Much of the focus so far has been on reducing vehicle and power plant emissions.
The Delhi government has announced plans to clean up the transportation
sector by introducing 1,000 electric public transport buses to its
5,500-strong fleet and meeting a goal for 25% of private vehicles
to be electric by 2023. Other government
proposals, such as banning private vehicles, have been met with protest
and ridicule. &#x0201c;If you ban private vehicles you need a public
transport system to meet demand,&#x0201d; Dahiya says. &#x0201c;We don&#x02019;t
have that system.&#x0201d;</p><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2019-00009b_0002" id="GRAPHIC-d7e140-autogenerated" position="float"><caption><p>The Delhi government is testing electric
buses, with plans to add
1,000 such buses to its fleet. Credit: PMI Electro Mobility Solutions.</p></caption></graphic><p>The biggest positive step taken by the Delhi
government was to
permanently shut down the old, polluting Badarpur coal-fired power plant
in the southeastern outskirts of Delhi, Dahiya says. The plant, a major
cause of the Capital Region&#x02019;s air pollution, had been shut
down every winter for the past three years as a way to scale back
pollution. The CPCB has recently mandated that all highly polluting
industrial plants install automatic emission-measurement stations,
which will send data to the CPCB in real time to better enable enforcement
of pollution rules.</p><p>Meanwhile, India&#x02019;s state-run power
producer, the NTPC, announced plans in October to start burning
agricultural residue along with coal at its power plants near Delhi
and eventually across the country. This cofiring should provide double
benefits by avoiding the particulate pollution from directly burning crop waste and cutting power plant emissions, since agricultural residue
can burn cleaner without the mercury and sulfur that are released
with burning coal, Sharma says.</p><p>Other
programs by regional and commercial entities are aiming to
provide similar incentives. The Haryana state government is experimenting
with providing farmers a machine called a Happy Seeder, which converts
agricultural residue to fertilizer. In November, Swedish furniture
giant Ikea announced plans to buy crop residue from farmers to use
in products.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>A Problem of Compliance</title><p>The government
is taking steps to improve air quality, but they
are still small and scattered. According to TERI, several
concerted, combined measures could cut particulate pollution in Delhi
by half. Turning agricultural residue into profitable products could
reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels in the winter by 12%. A more reliable supply of
grid electricity to avoid running diesel generators and more clean-burning
liquefied petroleum gas cooking stoves to replace biomass burning
would cut levels by 13.7%. Enforcing pollution standards for industries
and introducing 8,000 electric buses would cut another 10.5%.</p><p>But a giant hurdle to fixing India&#x02019;s
pollution is the implementation
of existing rules, the Centre for Science and Environment&#x02019;s Mukerjee says. &#x0201c;There are several policies
and laws already in place but that are not being met on the ground.&#x0201d;
Fireworks bans have not stopped people setting off fireworks. Vehicle emissions test centers are
notorious for giving fraudulent compliance certificates. Construction
companies do not suppress dust as required by using strategies such as setting up barriers, covering debris,
or sprinkling building materials with water for storage and transport.</p><p>Uncontrolled fires at landfills are also a result
of policies being
ignored. Garbage dumps in Delhi have officially been shut since 2009
because they are already at capacity, but around 80% of the 10,000 metric tons
of waste the city generates every day is still dumped in these sites,
he says. The buildup of methane from the organic waste deep in the
landfill leads to large spontaneous fires that can last for days because
they are hard to douse.</p><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2019-00009b_0003" id="GRAPHIC-d7e159-autogenerated" position="float"><caption><p>Smoke from landfill fires, which are
difficult to control, add
to air pollution in Delhi. Credit: Dipak Shilare/Shutterstock.</p></caption></graphic><p>The other glaring problem is political. Delhi,
a city as well as
a federally governed territory, gets caught between national, state,
and local governments, all with different electoral interests to serve.
The governments of Delhi and neighboring states point fingers at each other. State
pollution control boards languish from a lack of funds and personnel.
&#x0201c;Nobody is taking a regional approach to pollution,&#x0201d;
Mukerjee says. Unless actions are taken jointly in Delhi and neighboring
states, nothing will happen. &#x0201c;Air doesn&#x02019;t know
any political boundaries.&#x0201d;</p><p>Yet it is the politicization
of the pollution issue that also gives
experts hope. &#x0201c;People are suffering, and they will be more
aware and will hold politicians accountable,&#x0201d; Dahiya says.
&#x0201c;Bureaucrats will be forced to work on it...If they don&#x02019;t
act on it, it can backfire on them.&#x0201d; Grassroots efforts to
make the public aware of air pollution levels and their health impacts,
as well as education on personal antipollution steps, seem to be helping,
he says.</p><p>Sharma points to even simpler solutions that would have a big near-term impact: proper waste management to avoid refuse and landfill fires, fully paved roads with curbs and landscaping so vehicles don't stir up dust, construction-dust control, and the promotion of clean fuels and renewable energy. Those measures would have to work in concert with
stringent
standards and improved enforcement. &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s not a hopeless situation,&#x0201d; Sharma says.
&#x0201c;Models clearly show that you can achieve ambient air quality
standards in Delhi...if you put the right technology and the right
management in place.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec99"><p><italic>Prachi Patel is a freelance contributor
