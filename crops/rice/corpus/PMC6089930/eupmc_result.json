    "The effect of Chinese Milk Vetch (CMV) residues as a cover crop on the performance of rice plants and nitrogen mobilization and mineralization in paddy soil was evaluated in a pot-culture experiment. Three treatments were included in the trial, i.e. without exogenous-N (Control or CK), urea fertilizer as the sole N-source (N) and urea plus CMV (NM). The results revealed higher amounts of total-N, inorganic-N, acid hydrolysable-N and non-acid hydrolysable-N in the soil under NM, followed by N and CK treatments at tillering, booting and maturity stages of rice. A similar trend was observed for various soil ammonia oxidizing bacteria, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Correlation coefficients exhibited a negative correlation of residual exogenous-15N with only amino acid nitrogen (P < 0.01). Moreover, low abundance of the key functional gene amoA in rice was found in CK treatment. From the results it can be concluded that the nitrogen from organic source can improve the availability of total-N, inorganic-N and NH4 in the soil, especially at the later stages of rice growth."
