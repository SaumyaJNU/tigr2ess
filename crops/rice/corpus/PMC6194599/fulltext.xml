It is well documented that salicylic acid (SA) can enhance the stress tolerance of plants; however, its effect on the reproductive organs of rice plants has not been described before. To investigate the mechanism underlying the SA-mediated alleviation of the heat stress damage to rice pollen viability, a susceptible cultivar (Changyou1) was treated with SA at the pollen mother cell (PMC) meiosis stage and then subjected to heat stress of 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10 d until 1d before flowering.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Under control conditions, no significant difference was found in pollen viability and seed-setting rate in SA treatments. However, under heat stress conditions, SA decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in anthers to prevent tapetum programmed cell death (PCD) and degradation.

In these areas, extremely high temperatures occur with increasing frequency during recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been well documented that extremely high temperatures during the reproductive stage significantly decreases the grain yield by more than 50%, even causing complete loss of harvest in rice plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Male sterility induced by heat stress is one of the main factors that cause the decrease in grain yield of rice. It has been reported that the young microspore stage, immediately after meiosis, shows sensitivity to high temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Heat stress occurring at this stage causes the degeneration of microspores and the hypertrophy of tapetal cells, ultimately causes male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">One of the essential steps of the sexual reproduction of plants is the production of viable pollen from anthers, which have four lobes with similar structure that are attached to a central core via connective and vascular tissues. Mature meiosis cells at the center of the anther lobe have four somatic layers: the epidermis, the endothecium, the middle layer, and the tapetum from the surface to the interior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As the innermost sporophytic layer of the anther wall, the tapetum plays an essential role for the development from microspores to pollen grains. The tapetum is in direct contact with the developing gametophytes that provide enzymes for the release of microspores from tetrads as well as nutrients for pollen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mutants cannot produce viable pollen, which is partially due to defects in tapetum function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Such results have also been reported in plants that suffered from severe abiotic stress during the meiosis stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], since plants are particularly sensitive to abiotic stress during the meiosis and young microspore stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. During this stage, even mild or short-term abiotic stress can cause a significant decrease in pollen fertility.</p><p id="Par20">Sorghum and rice display male sterility if they are exposed to cold conditions during meiosis and microspore development, which mainly results in abnormal tapetum development and degradation, and ultimately leads to aberrant pollen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In heat-susceptible rice plants, heat stress lasting 4 days or longer during the early phase of the anther development causes premature degradation of tapetum cells and programmed cell death (PCD), and leads to complete male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, tapetum cells with a large vacuole were observed at the tetrad stage under heat conditions, while at the uninucleate stage, the membrane was blebbing and the cytoplasmic was in a state of degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. During this process, enlarged and irregularly shaped mitochondria as well as severely shrunken tapetal cells were also found in stressed plants, resulting in degeneration of the pollen exine layer and empty anther locules. Under heat stress, the genes related to male sterility (such as <italic>YY1, YY2, TGMS</italic>, and <italic>tms5</italic>) were down regulated in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, the <italic>Arabidopsis YUCCA</italic> gene exhibited down regulation under heat stress, especially in tapetum and pollen mother cells, which led to a significant decrease of male fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, changes of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellins (GAs), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins (CTKs), free proline, and soluble protein contents were found in stressed anthers; however, except for the IAA, 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), ABA, and other phytohormones or regulators including salicylic acid (SA) have been rarely reported to reverse the pollen sterility caused by heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">SA is known as a phenolic compound that naturally exists in plants at a very low concentration; however, it is a hormone-like substance that plays an important role for the regulation of plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that SA not only functions in response to biotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but also plays an important role in abiotic stress, including cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], heavy metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported that exogenous acetyl SA enhanced the thermo-tolerance in four-week-old tomato seedlings by improving root morphological features and root activity. Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, antioxidant systems, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and hydrogen sulfide are involved in SA-induced heat tolerance of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additionally, Clarke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] suggested that JA acted with SA inducing basal thermo-tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. These results indicate that SA can protect plants from heat damage during the vegetative stage, while only few reported studies focused on the reproductive stage. Our previous results indicated that SA could alleviate damage of the spikelet differentiation caused by heat stress during the floret differentiation stage of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, SA has been suggested to be involved in plant flowering and pollen tip growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Thus, we suspect that SA can reduce pollen sterility when encountering high temperature stress at the PMC meiosis stage, which has not been documented before. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the pollen viability, tapetum ultrastructure, tapetum PCD, antioxidant enzymes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of tapetum development genes were investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="Par22">The rice hybrid Changyou1, which was considered to be thermally susceptible, was purchased from the academy of agriculture sciences of Changshu city, Jiangsu province.

Furthermore, under heat stress, rice plants sprayed with SA at 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM attained a significantly higher seed-setting rate and pollen viability compared to those of the NON-SA treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The most effective SA concentration was found to be 10&#x000a0;mM under heat stress and no inhibition was found on the rice plants when they were sprayed with 50&#x000a0;mM SA. Although similar results have been reported in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the present SA concentrations were much higher than those reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Such a phenomenon might be caused by the plant species, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. For plants, a low level of SA (0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;mM SA) is optimal to elicit the highest level of stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Pretreatment with SA at these concentrations (0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;mM) causes low levels of ROS accumulation in rice plants containing higher endogenous SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Additionally, our previous results indicated that 0.1&#x000a0;mM SA sprayed on rice plants at the floret differentiation stage noticeably alleviated the inhibition on the spikelet numbers caused by heat stress; however, no significant differences were found among SA treatments between 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This phenomenon was also described by Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], who suggested spraying of SA at 100&#x000a0;mM prior to heat stress as a most effective treatment in wheat cultivars that face heat stress. However, when we added SA to the nutrient solution, the rice plants were severely inhibited at higher concentrations compared to control conditions. Additionally, SA was reported to negatively affect the response to salt stress in pea plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, such an inhibition was not found in rice plants grown in paddy fields, and even those sprayed with SA of 100&#x000a0;mM at the floret differentiation stage.</p><p id="Par49">Pollen abortion of plants caused by abiotic stress is always a result of their abnormal tapetum development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which directly contacts the developing male gametophyte and plays a critical role in the development and maturation of microspores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this tissue is susceptible to abiotic stress, especially during the PMC meiosis stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Drought stress at this stage significantly decreases pollen viability, which is possibly caused by the repression of the anther cell wall invertase gene (<italic>IVR1</italic>), leading to sucrose accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and abnormal starch levels in a further connective tissue, ultimately resulting in pollen abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Under cold stress, ABA increases and negatively regulates the expression of tapetum cell wall bound invertase and monosaccharide transport genes, resulting in a distorted carbohydrate pool in the anther and thus, in pollen sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Without exception, SA reversed the heat stress caused pollen abortion of rice plants mainly through protecting tapetum tissues from heat damage. Under control conditions, the tapetum tissues in anthers of rice plants were complete irrespective of SA concentrations, suggesting that these tissues suffered little damage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>-<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). However, the tapetum tissues were severely damaged by heat stress and displayed cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation, especially for NON-SA treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">m</xref>). Although increasing evidence confirms that SA enhances heat resistance in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], this protective function of SA on tapetum tissues has not been reported before. Since tapetum development involves an array of events, many factors including the genes related to tapetum development are involved in the dysfunction of tapetum caused by abiotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Indeed, SA-mediated prevention of tapetum degradation caused by heat stress might be related to the genes <italic>MIL2</italic> and <italic>DTM1</italic>. <italic>MIL2</italic> regulates the differentiation of primary parietal cells into secondary parietal cells in rice anthers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], while <italic>DTM1</italic> controls the early stage of tapetum development of rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In the present study, heat stress significantly inhibited the expression of <italic>MIL2</italic> and <italic>DTM1</italic> in anthers treated with H<sub>2</sub>O, while this inhibition was reversed by SA treatment. Significant decreases or clear increases were found in plants treated with specific concentration of SA under heat stress compared to their respective controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). However, how SA affects the expression of <italic>MIL2</italic> and <italic>DTM1</italic> under heat stress remains unclear.</p><p id="Par50">PCD is a cell controlled and organized destruction process where cells are selectively eliminated in a highly coordinated and multi-step fashion through the involvement of specific proteases and nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. PCD plays an important role during development and also during the stress response in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. However, PCD can also be a consequence of severe abiotic and biotic stresses. Increasing evidence indicates that apoptotic-like PCD can be induced by both biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. In this study, PCD was found in the tapetum under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), accompanied by tapetum tissue degeneration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that PCD was a consequence of heat damage. SA could alleviate such damage, since the PCD in the tapetum of anthers that were sprayed with SA of 10&#x000a0;mM was noticeably lower than that of NON-SA treatment under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This finding agrees with the result of Zhang and Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], who reported that SA prevented Cd-induced photosynthetic damage and cell death, and the inhibition of ROS overproduction was the main factor. Interestingly, similar results were also found in the present research, in which the anther ROS of plants sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O were significantly higher than those of plants sprayed with SA at 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Accordingly, their POD and APX activities were noticeably higher than that of NON-SA treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). This suggests that under heat stress SA can enhance the antioxidant ability of rice plants to maintain the redox state by scavenging excess ROS, which is mainly contributing to PCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In general, lower doses of ROS are utilized as signals, mediating at least part of the responses to stresses; however, they pose a significant threat that may eventually lead to PCD at higher concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Under natural or abiotic stress, SA induces PCD through increasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, accompanied by a reduction of CAT and POD activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. This suggests that an antagonistic mechanism exists between SA and antioxidant enzymes such CAT, POD, and APX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, no significant difference was found in the activities of antioxidant enzymes among SA treatments under control conditions, while heat stress induced POD and APX activities of rice plants sprayed with SA at 1.0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM were significantly higher than that of the NON-SA treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be involved in this process that mediates SA to enhance heat tolerance in rice plants. This assumption was confirmed by the results obtained in this study, as rice plants sprayed with SA or PAC&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> attained noticeably higher pollen viability than those plants sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O, PAC, or SA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DMTU under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9A</xref>). Accordingly, sprayed with SA or PAC&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed a higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content as well as lower MDA content compared to other treatments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>, a and b). This finding is consistent with the results of Dat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], who reported that thermos-protection can be obtained by spraying SA through an early increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Then, both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and catalase activity significantly decreased below control levels between 2 and 3&#x000a0;h after SA treatment, which occurred during the period of maximum thermos-protection. For this case, the low ROS accumulation induced by SA does not lead to cell death. In contrast, the non-toxic elevation of ROS content served as a signal for the activation of defensive responses in the cell, including enhancing its antioxidant abilities.</p><p id="Par52">Currently, a novel family of cysteine proteases called metacaspases appeares to act as a trigger in ageing and oxidative stress-activated PCD. Caspase-3 activation is a landmark event in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Caspase-3 activation and caspase-3-like activity have been widely used as a definitive way of detecting PCD in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The relationship between caspase-3 activity and SA remains unclear under control conditions since there was no noticeable difference in caspase-3 activity among SA treatments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, caspase-3 activity was inhibited by 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;mM SA under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Similar changing patterns were also found in ROS, suggesting that it might mediate SA to inhibit the caspase-3-like activity of anthers of rice plants under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), since ROS requires caspase-like activation to cause cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. However, several genes involved in PCD during the tapetum degeneration in meiosis or post meiosis have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. It is therefore possible that these genes can be directly induced by SA to regulate tapetum degeneration under heat stress, (e.g. <italic>EAT1</italic>). A significant increase induced by heat stress was found for the expression level of <italic>EAT1</italic>, while SA inhibited its expression under heat stress, in particular for the treatment of 10&#x000a0;mM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). No significant difference in the expression level of <italic>EAT1</italic> was found between the control and heat stress in anthers sprayed with 10&#x000a0;mM SA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). This pathway might be independent of ROS, possibly because no reports have indicated that ROS were required for the induction of those genes. However, the mechanism underlying SA inhibiting <italic>EAT1</italic> expression in anther under heat stress remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par53">SA conferred heat resistance in rice plants at the PMC meiosis stage, where higher pollen viability and seed-setting rates were found in rice plants treated with SA under heat stress. This effect was mainly caused by the SA-mediated reduction of excessive ROS in anthers, which prevented tapetum degradation caused by heat stress by inhibiting the caspase-3 activation, and thus, PCD in anthers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Additionally, genes related to tapetum development of rice such as <italic>EAT1</italic>, <italic>MIL2</italic>, and <italic>DMT1</italic> were found to be involved in SA-mediated prevention of heat stress caused tapetum degradation, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). This pathway might be dependent of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that SA could enhance the heat tolerance of rice plants through other pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). However, higher pollen viability and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels as well as lower MDA levels were found in rice plants in response to treatment with SA or PAC&#x02009;+&#x02009;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under heat stress compared to plants sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O, PAC, or SA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DMTU. Thus, there is no doubt that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at least plays a key role in mediating SA to enhance pollen viability under heat stress at the PMC meiosis stage of rice.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Descriptive model of the salicylic acid functions toward preventing pollen abortion of rice in response to heat stress.
