    "Biological control is a promising measure in the control of plant disease. In the present study, we isolated 13 endophytic strains from Angelica dahurica. Among them, an endophytic strain which was named GYLH001 exhibited remarkable activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. 16S rRNA sequence analysis, biochemical and physiological proved that it is Bacillus tequilensis. The sterilized culture filtrate of GYLH001 can inhibit the growth of M.oryzae, which suggests the presence of secondary metabolites. Proved by experiment, GYLH001 can produce cellulase, protease, gelatinase, indole-3-acetic acid and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase. In addition, the temperature experiment showed that secondary metabolites produced by GYLH001 had good thermal stability. They can remain activity even heated at 100Â°C for 30 min. They also had good acid-resistance in heavily acidic condition. But under alkaline condition, the antifungal effect decreased significantly. By simulative field tests, the spraying of GYLH001 spore solution could prevent and treat rice blast. Through continuous separation and purification of sterilized culture filtrate and identification by mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of an active substance is 364.26. In the control of rice blast, B. tequilensis GYLH001 has potential as a biological control agent in agriculture."
