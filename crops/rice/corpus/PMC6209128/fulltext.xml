In the present study, we isolated 13 endophytic strains from <italic>Angelica dahurica</italic>. Among them, an endophytic strain which was named GYLH001 exhibited remarkable activity against <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. 16S rRNA sequence analysis, biochemical and physiological proved that it is <italic>Bacillus tequilensis</italic>. The sterilized culture filtrate of GYLH001 can inhibit the growth of <italic>M</italic>.<italic>oryzae</italic>, which suggests the presence of secondary metabolites. Proved by experiment, GYLH001 can produce cellulase, protease, gelatinase, indole-3-acetic acid and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase. In addition, the temperature experiment showed that secondary metabolites produced by GYLH001 had good thermal stability. They can remain activity even heated at 100&#x000b0;C for 30 min. They also had good acid-resistance in heavily acidic condition. But under alkaline condition, the antifungal effect decreased significantly. By simulative field tests, the spraying of GYLH001 spore solution could prevent and treat rice blast. Through continuous separation and purification of sterilized culture filtrate and identification by mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of an active substance is 364.26. In the control of rice blast, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tequilensis</italic> GYLH001 has potential as a biological control agent in agriculture.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 31271802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zhengjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The work in our lab was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31271802).

With improvement of living standards, people have attached more importance to rice quality and yield [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, losses caused by phytopathogenic fungi have caused great reduction of rice yield resulting in food shortage. Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, is a severe and highly popular disease that results in 10%-30% rice yield losses annually [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So, an increasing number of people have been planting resistant rice varieties and using chemical fungicide to prevent and treat rice blast effectively. Although chemical fungicide has many advantages like low cost and high effectiveness, overuse of chemical fungicide not only pollutes the environment but also makes rice blast become more drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, it is also hard to against rice blast by planting resistant rice varieties because of complexity of rice blast genetic background. Therefore, it is urgent to find more effective and safer methods to suppress rice blast. In recent years, there is an increasing interest of exploitation of rice blast for biological control by using plant beneficial microorganisms owing to their low toxicity and a lack of pathogen resistance [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp., actinomycetes, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. and other antifungal strains produce a lot of antibiotics and enzymes. Antibiotics are secondary metabolites which are produced by antagonistic microbes with diverse biological activities [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203505.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. And their use as biological control agents poses minimal detrimental effects on the environment [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Endophytic strains are living inside plant tissues without any obvious symptoms of infection or diseases for most of their life cycles and mutualistic to their hosts [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Endophytic strains are deemed to interact closely with their host plants and keep them from attacking by fungi, insects and mammals by secreting bioactive secondary metabolites to inhibit the growth of pathogens directly or improve resistance of host plants [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0203505.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As a matter of fact, endophytic strains have already reported that entophytic <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> var. <italic>amyloliquefaciens</italic> EPB9, EPB10, EPCO29 and EPCO78 indicated significantly high inhibition of bacterial leaf blight [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

For a long time, people have been committed to taking full advantage of antagonism to apply to many fields such as agricultural defense and medical domain. Plant fungal diseases are difficult to control, which makes it possible to lead to huge economic losses. Thus, strategies to ensure that plants avoid to fungal infection should be developed, especially by the development of biological control methods [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>A number of plants from the apiacease, such as <italic>Angelica dahurica</italic>, show cytotoxicity, antitumor and are against pathogenic microorganism. In our current study, several endophytic strains have been isolated from the <italic>Angelica dahurica</italic>. GYLH001 was one of the most active endophytic strains which can inhibit the growth of plant pathogens <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. The sterilized culture filtrate of GYLH001 significantly inhibited growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. The strong antifungal activity and lack of toxicity towards rice showed the potential of the strain for the application in rice blast protection. In the present study, based on the physiological, biochemical characteristics, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, GYLH001 was identified as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tequilensis</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first isolation of endophytic <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tequilensis</italic> from <italic>Angelica dahurica</italic>.</p><p>Due to the production of cell wall degrading enzymes and other antifungal natural products, Many species of strains, especially those belonging to the <italic>Bacillus</italic>, can inhibit the growth of phytopathogenic fungi [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We find that GYLH001 can produce extracellular enzymes, which makes it possible to have the capacity to demonstrate multiple mechanisms against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. First, chitinase, cellulase and protease might cause an abnormal hyphal morphology of pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, cellulase and protease secreted by GYLH001 can cause the hyphal deformation and growth suppression of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Second, IAA and ACC deaminase secreted by GYLH001 can promote plant growth by reducing the adverse effects of ethylene. As we know, plant growth promoters might improve plant disease resistance indirectly. Maybe, it could be a result of the antagonism of <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the protection of host rice against pathogens by promoting the growth of rice. In addition, further studies aiming to identify the compounds responsible for the antifungal activity of GYLH001 are in progress in our laboratory.</p><p>Through the stability assessment experiment, the results show that the active metabolites have good stability for the strong acid and high temperature. It has laid a good foundation for the future of biological control against plant disease. In particular, the stability of high temperature of active metabolites is an advantage of biological pesticide research and development, which overcomes the disadvantages of saving of traditional biological pesticide.</p><p>At the given fermentation condition, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tequilensis</italic> GYLH001 enter the logarithmic growth period after 12 h of cultivation. The strongest of antifungal activity was obtained during the stationary phase 48 h after inoculation. With the increase of inoculation time, antifungal activity is almost constant. In the previous research, at the end of the exponential growth phase, the antibiotics usually starts to be produced. It reaches maximum concentration after cell growth having ceased and this is in agreement with the production kinetics of the strain GYLH001.</p><p>By evaluation of control efficacy, we can find that GYLH001 significantly inhibits the growth of rice blast. But, we find that the preventive effect is better than the therapeutic effect. To our knowledge, the present chemical fungicides are only effective for preventing and not effective for curing rice blast [<xref rid="pone.0203505.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The result obtained with GYLH001 shows a similar pattern. So we deduce that GYLH001 might be effectively conducive to the plant resistance of disease by secreting antifungal metabolites and growth promoters.</p><p>Although we obtained a pure substance with strong bacteriostatic effect by continuous separation and purification, its molecular weight was 364.26. However, due to the extremely unstable metabolic process, it is impossible to collect sufficient quantities for nuclear magnetic resonance examination and infer its structure. In future studies, we will optimize the separation and purification of each fraction and obtain the structure of the substance as soon as possible for subsequent studies.</p><p>In a word, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tequilensis</italic> GYLH001 appears to be a promising candidate as a biological control agent for rice blast in agricultural applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0203505.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>16S rRNA base sequence of GYLH001 (1542bp).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0203505.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The work in our lab was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31271802).
