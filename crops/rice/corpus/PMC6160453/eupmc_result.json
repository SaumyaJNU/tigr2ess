    "Members of the Yippee-like (YPEL) gene family are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are homologous to the Drosophila yippee gene. In this study, we functionally characterized two YPEL-homologous genes, MoYPEL1 and MoYPEL2, in the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae using the deletion mutants ΔMoypel1, ΔMoypel2, and ΔΔMoypel1,2. The MoYPEL1 deletion mutant was significantly defective in conidiation and unable to undergo appressorium development; however, deletion of MoYPEL2 resulted in a significant increase in conidiation and the abnormal development of two appressoria per conidium. These data demonstrate the opposite roles of each member of the YPEL gene family during the development of M. oryzae. The double mutant was phenotypically similar to the ΔMoypel1 mutant in conidiation, but similar to the ΔMoypel2 mutant in appressorium development. Subcellular localization of the MoYPEL1 protein was dynamic during appressorium development, while the MoYPEL2 protein consistently localized within the nuclei during developmental stages. Our studies indicate that the two YPEL gene family members play distinct roles in the developmental stages of M. oryzae, furthering our understanding of disease dissemination and development in fungi."
