    "Antibodies against citrinin (CTN) were generated from rabbits, which were injected with CTN-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). This work involved the development of a sensitive competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cdELISA) and a rapid gold nanoparticle immunochromatographic strip (immunostrip) method for analyzing CTN in Monascus-fermented food. CTN at a concentration of 5.0 ng/mL caused 50% inhibition (IC50) of CTN-horseradish peroxidase (CTN-HRP) binding to the antibodies in the cdELISA. The capable on-site detection of CTN was accomplished by a rapid antibody-gold nanoparticle immunostrip with a detection limit of 20 ng/mL and that was completed within 15 min. A close inspection of 19 Monascus-fermented foods by cdELISA confirmed that 14 were contaminated with citrinin at levels from 28.6⁻9454 ng/g. Further analysis with the immunostrip is consistent with those results obtained using cdELISA. Both means are sensitive enough for the rapid examination of CTN in Monascus-fermented food products."
