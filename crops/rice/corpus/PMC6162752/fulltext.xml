Introduction</title><p>Citrinin (CTN) is a secondary metabolite synthesized from <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Penicillium</italic> and contaminates corn, wheat, barley and rice [<xref rid="B1-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CTN is also a secondary metabolite that is synthesized by <italic>Monascus</italic> spp. (red yeast), which is a fungal strain that is traditionally used in brewing rice. <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented products are widely added to meat and wine as a food additive pigment. In western countries, fermentation products developed by <italic>Monascus</italic> are considered health food and are widely used to prevent cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (Taiwan-FDA) reported that 58 of 84 commercially available <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented rice samples collected in 2009&#x02013;2012 were contaminated with 0.4&#x02013;93.5 ppm of citrinin, and the contamination of citrinin in fermented rice is very serious [<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the toxicity and content of CTN in <italic>Monascus</italic> health foods has become a public concern. In 1986, the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) categorized CTN as a group 3 carcinogen but with insufficient evidence of its carcinogenicity [<xref rid="B5-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Taiwan, the maximum allowable level of CTN in red yeast rice, <italic>Monascus</italic> products, and <italic>Monascus</italic> colors are 5 ppm, 2 ppm and 0.2 ppm, respectively. Japan set a limit of 0.2 ppm CTN in red fermented products [<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Currently, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) are used to measure CTN levels in food [<xref rid="B6-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The advantages of HPLC and LC/MS/MS methods are their high accuracy and reproducibility, but they have drawbacks, for example, they require expensive equipment, qualified personnel, and time-consuming sample preparation. Thus, analyzing large amounts of samples in a short time using these methods is impossible. Therefore, rapid, easy-to-use, immunochemical methods for detecting CTN in fermented foods have been developed. [<xref rid="B11-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, most immunochemical methods cannot be used for on-site testing attributable to their multiplex washing steps, long reaction time and the need for expensive instrumentation. Hence, on-site detection methods that are rapid, stable, reliable and affordable must be developed.</p><p>The advantages of gold nanoparticles are their high stability and high absorption coefficient. Gold nanoparticles can be synthesized promptly and can be conjugated easily with an antibody [<xref rid="B15-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, gold nanoparticles are widely used in biosensor and immunochromatographic strips (immunostrip) for detecting mycotoxins [<xref rid="B17-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In an immunostrip, the test samples and gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates migrate by capillary action onto a nitrocellulose membrane where they interact with the test and the control line. The colored gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates offer a quick on-site testing in less than 15 min without additional equipment and provide visible results [<xref rid="B19-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that many samples from diverse regions are contaminated with various levels of CTN [<xref rid="B3-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this investigation, a specific polyclonal antibody against CTN was produced and successfully used in a sensitive ELISA and a gold nanoparticle immunostrip for analyzing CTN in <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented food.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-toxins-10-00354"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.1. Production and Characterization of Antibodies</title><p>New Zealand rabbits received four immunizations with CTN-KLH conjugates as immunogens that would cause them to generate antibodies for citrinin. Both competitive indirect and direct ELISAs were then utilized to ascertain whether the antisera yielded antibodies specific to citrinin. The antiserum titer reached its highest level in the 70th week. Therefore, antiserum from the 70th week was conducted in the following study. The concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the binding of antibodies to the solid-phase citrinin&#x02014;ovalbumin (CTN-OVA) by free citrinin (IC<sub>50</sub>) was 4.6 ng/mL in the ciELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the binding of CTN-HRP to the antibodies by citrinin (IC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated as 5.0 ng/mL in the cdELISA. The detection limit of citrinin (IC<sub>10</sub>) was calculated to be 0.2 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) in accordance of a 90% confidence interval at 10% of inhibition of binding of the CTN-HRP conjugate. This cdELISA was further used to test whether the antibodies exhibited cross-reactivities with other mycotoxins. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, mycotoxins, for example, ochratoxin A (OTA) and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid whose structures are similar to that of citrinin, showed weak cross-reactivity with the antibodies. The concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the binding of antibodies to the CTN-HRP by 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid and OTA exceeded 1000 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Other mycotoxins, including patulin, zearalenone, aflatoxin and deoxynivalenol at a concentration 1000 ng/mL, could not inhibit the antibodies bind to the CTN-HRP conjugate in the cdELISA (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.2. Analytical Recovery of CTN Spiked to Red Yeast Rice Samples by cdELISA</title><p>A recovery study was conducted to examine the cdELISA correctness for the analysis of CTN which was spiked in red yeast rice samples. Results from the cdELISA are presented in <xref rid="toxins-10-00354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. When the CTN at spiked levels of 100 to 500 ng/g, the analytical recovery rates were found to be 81&#x02013;86% with coefficient of variation (CV) values less than 5%. On the other hand, the recovery rate and CV value of the sample spiked with 5000 ng/g CTN was 76% and 11.6, respectively; this sample was subjected to 5 fold more dilution for cdELISA in order to lie within the linear portion of standard curve. The overall average of analytical recovery for all the 100&#x02013;5000 ng/g samples was found to be 85% (CV, 7.65). These data suggested that the cdELISA is a feasible method for detecting CTN in red yeast rice samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.3. Assay of CTN in the Samples Using cdELISA</title><p>The effectiveness of cdELISA for measuring citrinin levels in fermented samples was assessed by collecting 19 brand-name samples and one control sample (rice) from local markets and testing them using cdELISA. To measure the level of citrinin more accurately and to prevent interference that would otherwise be caused by the extraction solution, the sample extractions were diluted 10-fold with 0.01 M PBS buffer and analyzed by the cdELISA. Samples 1 to 6 all contained high concentrations of citrinin from 1628 to 9454 ng/g (1.628 to 9.454 &#x000b5;g/g) (<xref rid="toxins-10-00354-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.). Moreover, the concentrations in sample 5 and 6 both exceeded the Taiwan-FDA regulatory limit of 5 &#x000b5;g/g (ppm) for citrinin in red yeast rice. Samples 7 to 19 from other <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented food, there are five not detected samples, the others contained citrinin at levels from 28.6 to 64.4 ng/g, which did not exceed the 2 &#x000b5;g/g (ppm) of Taiwan-FDA regulatory limit for citrinin in <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented products.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.4. Fabrication of the Immunostrip</title><p>The immunostrip provides a suitable means of detecting citrinin in <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented products on-site and is rapid and does not involve cumbersome operations. When the citrinin level in the sample surpasses a particular value, the toxin captures all of the binding sites of the antibody-gold conjugates in the sample solution or in the &#x0201c;conjugated pad&#x0201d;. Therefore, no available antibody-gold conjugate can bind with CTN-OVA in the test zone, and no red line is visible in the test zone, which indicated a positive result. The correctness of the assay is verified using a control zone with a goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody. With proper operation, a red line should always be visible in the control zone in spite of the presence or absence of citrinin. Therefore, the testing of a citrinin-negative sample should always produce two red lines on the membrane, whereas a toxin-positive sample should only display one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.5. Visual Detection Limit of an Immunostrip for CTN</title><p>Citrinin certified standard (0&#x02013;100 ng/mL) were subjected to immunostrip testing where CTN-OVA and goat anti-rabbit were drawn on the test zone and control line, respectively. When the citrinin certified analytical standard solution and the antibody-gold nanoparticles conjugates were directly mixed in a microplate well and the immunostrip was dipped into the well, the detection limit of the immunostrip was 20 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). When the citrinin level exceeded 20 ng/mL, the citrinin completely occupied the binding sites of the conjugates then no available antibody-gold nanoparticles could bind to the CTN-OVA in the test zone. Therefore, the immunostrip exhibited only one red line in the control zone. The color density on the test line was also analyzed by a strip scan reader and this established the standard curves, whereas the T line color density value is less than 25, which indicated a positive result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). Alternatively, when the antibody-gold nanoparticles were absorbed by the release pad, the visual detection limit of the immunostrip was 20&#x02013;50 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) while the T line color density value was less than 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Accordingly, the samples and antibody-coated gold nanoparticles were mixed first and then subject to the immunostrip for sample analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-toxins-10-00354"><title>2.6.

Discussion</title><p>Food that is contaminated with mycotoxins such as citrinin affects human health [<xref rid="B24-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, the development of a quick detection means for citrinin is very important, simplifies the preparation of samples and reduces the cost of analysis of the critical points. This study focuses on the ELISA and the development of an immunostrip. Both methods are simple and more rapid than that of the chemical methods. CTN is small molecular weight mycotoxin, which is non-immunogenic but has to be coupled with a protein carrier to exhibit this immunogenicity. Although CTN has a carboxylic acid group that could be conjugated to a protein carrier using a water-soluble carbodiimide method, the hydroxyl group on the eighth carbon forms a hydrogen bond with carboxylic acid on the 14th carbon, and the ketone group on the sixth carbon forms a hydrogen bond with carboxylic acid on the 14th carbon [<xref rid="B12-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These hydrogen bonds eliminate the capacity of the carboxylic acid to conjugate with a protein carrier with an amine group. Therefore, the carbodiimide method is not suitable for conjugating CTN with proteins. CTN also has a methyl group that could be conjugated to a protein carrier by the Mannich method using formaldehyde [<xref rid="B26-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and therefore, a formaldehyde method was used herein to conjugate CTN with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) to make it a valid antigen to produce specific antibodies for citrinin.</p><p>The high sensitivity of cdELISA and ciELISA depends on the quality of the CTN-HRP conjugates and CTN-OVA conjugates. In this study, the conjugation of citrinin and HRP with a molecular ratio 44:1 with the Mannich method maximized the cdELISA sensitivity, and the conjugation of citrinin and OVA with the molecular ratio 22:1 by the Mannich method maximized the ciELISA sensitivity. In the ciELISA, the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the binding of antibodies to the solid-phase CTN-OVA by free citrinin (IC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated to be 4.6 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In cdELISA, the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of the binding of CTN-HRP to the antibodies by CTN (IC<sub>50</sub>) was 5.0 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Ochratoxin A and synthetic compound 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid whose portion of structures are similar to that of citrinin, showed 10% weak cross-reactivity with the antibodies at a level of 100 ng/mL. Although Kong, Xie, Liu, Song and Kuang (2017) [<xref rid="B27-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported a ciELISA and immunostrip for CTN, they had not developed the cdELISA method and were also short of the real sample analysis. Due to the cdELISA is more simple and rapid than ciELISA, this study devoted to the development of cdELISA and its application to screening a large amount of red yeast fermented samples. In cdELISA, the samples were extracted using 100% methanol and were generally diluted at least 10-fold with 0.01 M PBS to avoid solvent and matrix interference. The cdELISA can tolerate up to 10% methanol in the analyzed samples [<xref rid="B28-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and its detection limit is determined to be 0.2 ng/mL in accordance with a 90% confidence interval at 10% of inhibition of binding of the CTN-HRP conjugate. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p><p>The Taiwan FDA has set regulatory limits of 200 ppb, 2 ppm and 5 ppm on citrinin in red yeast rice pigments, red yeast food and red yeast rice, respectively. Japan also set a regulatory limit of 200 ppb in red yeast pigment [<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The results of this study reveal that two out of six red yeast rice samples that were collected in a local supermarket contained more than 5 ppm of citrinin and one contained 9.5 ppm, which is almost two times that of Taiwan&#x02019;s regulatory limits (<xref rid="toxins-10-00354-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, some other red yeast samples that were contained with CTN levels that did not violate the limit. This article involved in using immunochemical method such as ELISA and rapid gold nanoparticle immunostrip for rapid and on-site detection of citrinin. In order to confirm the efficacy and correctness of sample analysis by using cdELISA, we have analyzed the recovery of CTN spiked to red yeast rice samples. The results indicated that the recovery rates were found to be 76&#x02013;97% which suggested that the cdELISA is a feasible method for detecting CTN in the samples. Chemical analytical method such as HPLC for citrinin analysis is not our main focus. Detecting citrinin in red yeast rice samples using HPLC was carried out and published by Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. Liao, et al. [<xref rid="B4-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] have reported that 58 of 84 commercially available <italic>Monascus</italic>-fermented rice samples collected in 2009&#x02013;2012 were contaminated with 0.4&#x02013;93.5 ppm of citrinin. Therefore, the contamination of citrinin in fermented rice is very serious.</p><p>There are several advantages of the immunostrip over ELISA include time-savings and the ease of application by the user. Unskilled personnel without using any devices can acquire analytical results using the immunostrip in 15 min, which makes this method very feasible for the on-site testing of CTN. This is the first work to develop an immunostrip for detecting CTN in red yeast fermented samples. Even though large amounts of antibody and CTN-OVA conjugates are required for each sample assay, compared to the ELISA, which results in a slightly higher cost than the ELISA, the obvious advantages warrant its further development. Moreover, the absence of an enzyme reaction in the immunostrip provide its stability during a longer-term storage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows that the visual detection limit of the immunostrip is 20 ng/mL, which is below the regulatory limits of Taiwan. So that our immunostrip can meet the regulatory limit test requirements, we set the different dilution factors of 10, 100 and 250 for yeast rice pigments, red yeast food and red yeast rice, respectively. With respect to sample analysis, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f004">Figure 4</xref> are consistent with the data in <xref rid="toxins-10-00354-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, which proves that this immunostrip can be used to detect CTN in red yeast samples. According to a recent report [<xref rid="B29-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], most immunostrip researchers did not detect toxic bacteria or toxins from real food using their technologies. Many groups of researchers artificially added and spiked toxins before detection. There was a limit to the application. However, our study succeeded in detecting toxins from actual fermented foods using immunostrips. As previous studies have indicated, the intensity of the color and the competition between CTN in the sample and the CTN-OVA in the test line can be affected by the size of the antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates [<xref rid="B30-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, this study follows Frens (1973) [<xref rid="B31-toxins-10-00354" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in the synthesizing of gold nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 15 or 40 nm and then conjugating these different sizes of gold nanoparticles with antibodies specific for CTN. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-10-00354-f005">Figure 5</xref> indicates that the results using antibody-gold nanoparticles of 15 nm are better than that of using antibody-gold nanoparticles of 40 nm based on a T line color density by the strip scan reader. However, to develop a highly sensitive immunostrip, the decision was ultimately made to use the 15 nm gold nanoparticles to conjugate with antibodies specific to CTN and without a release pad.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-toxins-10-00354"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>This work developed antibodies against citrinin and is the first occurrence of their use in an immunostrip to detect CTN in red yeast samples. The concentration of CTN caused 50% inhibition of the binding of CTN-HRP to the antibodies and was calculated to be 5.0 ng/mL in the cdELISA, and the detection limit was determined to be 0.2 ng/mL. The immunostrip had a visual detection limit of 20 ng/mL in 15 min and it is sensitive enough for analyzing red yeast samples. The methods developed can have a vital role for the rapid detection of CTN in red yeast fermented food.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-toxins-10-00354"><title>5.
