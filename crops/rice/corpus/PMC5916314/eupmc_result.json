    "In the thousands of years of rice domestication in Asia, many useful genes have been lost from the gene pool. Wild rice is a key source of diversity for domesticated rice. Genome sequencing has suggested that the wild rice populations in northern Australia may include novel taxa, within the AA genome group of close (interfertile) wild relatives of domesticated rice that have evolved independently due to geographic separation and been isolated from the loss of diversity associated with gene flow from the large populations of domesticated rice in Asia. Australian wild rice was collected from 27 sites from Townsville to the northern tip of Cape York. Whole chloroplast genome sequences and 4,555 nuclear gene sequences (more than 8 Mbp) were used to explore genetic relationships between these populations and other wild and domesticated rices. Analysis of the chloroplast and nuclear data showed very clear evidence of distinctness from other AA genome Oryza species with significant divergence between Australian populations. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the Australian populations represent the earliest-branching AA genome lineages and may be critical resources for global rice food security. Nuclear genome analysis demonstrated that the diverse O. meridionalis populations were sister to all other AA genome taxa while the Australian O. rufipogon-like populations were associated with the clade that included domesticated rice. Populations of apparent hybrids between the taxa were also identified suggesting ongoing dynamic evolution of wild rice in Australia. These introgressions model events similar to those likely to have been involved in the domestication of rice."
