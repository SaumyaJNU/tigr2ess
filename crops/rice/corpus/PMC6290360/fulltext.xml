Ubiquitination is a crucial post-translational protein modification and participates in abiotic stress responses in higher plants. In this study, we identified and characterized OsDIRP1 (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Drought-Induced RING Protein 1), a nuclear-localized putative RING E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.). <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> expression was induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, but not by low temperature (4&#x000b0;C) stress, suggesting that <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> is differentially regulated by different abiotic stresses. To investigate its possible role in abiotic stress responses, <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic rice plants (<italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic>) were generated, and their phenotypes were analyzed. The T4 <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> lines showed decreased tolerance to drought and salt stress as compared to wild-type rice plants. Moreover, <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> progeny were less sensitive to ABA than the wild-type during both germination and post-germination growth. In contrast, <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> plants exhibited markedly higher tolerance to prolonged cold (4&#x000b0;C) treatment. These results suggest that OsDIRP1 acts as a negative regulator during drought and salt stress, whereas it functions as a positive factor during the cold stress response in rice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>cold stress</kwd><kwd>drought stress</kwd><kwd>opposite response</kwd><kwd>rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>)</kwd><kwd>RING E3 Ub ligase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Rural Development Administration<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003627</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="59"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>As sessile organisms, higher plants are constantly exposed to diverse environmental stresses, such as water deficit, high salinity, and extreme temperatures, throughout their life cycle that they cannot avoid. These detrimental conditions can disrupt plant growth, and on a larger scale, reduce global crop production (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to abiotic stress in plants, rapid increases in population also affect global food security (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lesk et al., 2016</xref>). Rice is a primary source of food for more than half of the world&#x02019;s population. Thus, improving the stress tolerance of rice is crucial to maintain high crop productivity and fulfill the growing demand for food.</p><p>Plant stress response and acclimation are regulated by a complex network of cellular factors, including stress perception and related signaling pathways, changes in hormonal and metabolic balances, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of stress-associated genes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Osakabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Guerra et al., 2015</xref>). Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification of diverse cellular proteins. In higher plants, the ubiquitination pathway is critically involved in the abiotic stress response (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Santner and Estelle, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lyzenga and Stone, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Ubiquitination is a multistep process, in which ubiquitin (Ub) is conjugated to target proteins by successive reactions catalyzed by three types of enzymes, E1 Ub activating enzymes, E2 Ub conjugating enzymes, and E3 Ub ligases. In general, E3 ligases specifically recognize the target protein (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Smalle and Viestra, 2004</xref>). E3 Ub ligases are divided into single- and multi-subunit types depending on their structure. Single-subunit E3 Ub ligases are further categorized into distinct families based on the presence of specific domains, such as the really interesting new gene (RING), U-box, and homology to E6AP C terminus (HECT) domains. Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) and anaphase-promoting complex (APS) belong to the multi-subunit E3 Ub ligases (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Kim, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is a well-known plant stress hormone that plays a pivotal role in the response to environmental stimuli (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhu, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006</xref>). Cellular levels of ABA are rapidly increased under stress conditions, which induces various physiological responses, such as stomata closure, growth inhibition, and the production of proline and sugars. Different kinds of E3 Ub ligases participate in both ABA production and the ABA-mediated stress response. For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> U-box E3 Ub ligase SAUL1/PUB44 negatively regulates the ABA biosynthetic enzyme aldehyde oxidase 3 (AAO3), whereas the RING E3 Ub ligase XERICO promotes ABA production by enhancing the expression of 9-<italic>cis</italic>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3 (NCED3) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Raab et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, E3 Ub ligases regulate ABA perception and the signal transduction cascade by mediating the degradation of ABA receptors, SnRK protein kinases, and transcription factors (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lyzenga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bueso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Irigoyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>RING E3 Ub ligases widely exist in eukaryotic organisms. Compared with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which has 47 RING-type E3 encoding genes, rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contain 378 and 499 genes, respectively (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kraft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mazzucotelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have revealed the cellular roles of RING E3 Ub ligases in response to abiotic stress in the dicot model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Stone, 2018</xref>). In contrast, our knowledge concerning the roles of RING E3 ligases in the monocot cereal rice in response to abiotic stresses is relatively rudimentary. SALT-AND DROUGHT-INDUCED RING FINGER1 (SDIR1) is a positive regulator of ABA-mediated drought stress response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). OsSDIR1 is a rice ortholog of SDIR1 and positively involved in the drought stress response in rice plants (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Drought-Induced SINA protein1 (OsDIS1), a rice RING E3 Ub ligase, plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through posttranslational regulation of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> NIMA-related kinase 6 (OsNek6), which is a tubulin complex-related serine/threonine protein kinase, and transcriptional regulation of stress-related genes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, rice <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Chloroplast Targeting RING E3 ligase 1 (OsCTR1) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Arsenic-Induced RING E3 ligase 1 (OsAIR1) were identified as positive factors in the drought stress response and post-germination growth under arsenate stress conditions, respectively (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, knock-down of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Stress-Related RING Finger Protein 1 (<italic>OsSRFP1</italic>) resulted in increased tolerance to high salt and cold stress in rice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified and characterized <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Drought-Induced RING Protein 1 (OsDIRP1), which is a nuclear-localized putative RING-type E3 Ub ligase in rice. <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> was induced by drought, high salinity, and ABA treatments, but not by cold stress (4&#x000b0;C). <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing T4 transgenic rice plants (<italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic>) exhibited reduced tolerance to drought and salt stress as compared to wild-type rice plants. <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFPs</italic> plants were less sensitive to ABA than wild-type plants during both the germination and post-germination stages. In contrast, the <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> progeny displayed markedly increased tolerance to cold stress relative to the wild-type plants. These results indicate that OsDIRP1 acts as a negative regulator of the drought and salt stress responses, while it works as a positive factor of the cold stress response in rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title><p>Dry seeds of the rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) japonica variety &#x02018;Dong-jin&#x02019; were washed with 70% ethanol and subsequently sterilized with a 0.4% NaClO solution.

Then, the growth of these seedlings was monitored for 6 days after transfer. Consistent with the results of the germination assay, the <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing seedlings appeared to be ABA-insensitive during post-germination growth. For example, in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M ABA, the shoot lengths of the wild-type and <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> plants were 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 cm and 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 cm &#x02013; 3.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 cm, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>).

Thus, the <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressors were insensitive to ABA during both the germination and post-germination stages, which is in agreement with the view that OsDIRP1 plays a negative role in the response to ABA.

The results showed that <italic>OsDREB1A</italic> and <italic>OsDREB1B</italic>, both of which are ABA-independent cold-responsive transcription factors (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dubouzet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006</xref>), were upregulated in <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing plants relative to the levels in wild-type plants after 24 h of cold treatment.

In contrast, the transcript level of <italic>OsDREB1D</italic> was slightly lower in the <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressors than in the wild-type plants under low temperature condition. OsDREB1D is a CRT/DRE element-binding transcription factor that is involved in the ABA-dependent abiotic stress response (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike other <italic>DREB1</italic> genes, <italic>DREB1D</italic> is induced by ABA, drought, and osmotic stress, but not by cold in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Haake et al., 2002</xref>). These results suggested that elevation of ABA-independent cold-responsive gene expression in the <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressors leads to increased tolerance to low temperature stress. Overall, these results indicated that, contrary to the drought and salt stress responses, <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to prolonged cold stress than wild-type plants, suggesting that OsDIRP1 plays a positive role in the cold stress response in rice.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Considerable evidence has indicated that RING-type E3 Ub ligases modulate plant responses to a broad spectrum of abiotic stress (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lyzenga and Stone, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Sadanandom et al., 2012</xref>). The majority of environmental stress-responsive RING E3 Ub ligases has been characterized in the dicot model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In this study, a putative RING E3 ligase OsDIRP1 was identified and characterized in the monocot model cereal rice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The low basal level of <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> expression was upregulated by drought, salt, and ABA treatments (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,C</xref>). However, <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> expression was unchanged in response to low temperature, suggesting that <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> is differentially regulated by different abiotic stresses. Nuclear-localized RING E3s have been shown to up- or down-regulate the expression of stress-related genes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Catal&#x000e1; et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these results, OsDIRP1 was predominantly localized to the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), suggesting its role in regulating gene expression in response to abiotic stress.</p><p>Constitutive upregulation of <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> in transgenic rice plants (<italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic>) led to a severe decrease in tolerance to drought and high salinity, as evidenced by anomalous growth performance, reduced chlorophyll content, and more rapid leaf water loss rates, which resulted in markedly lower survival as compared to wild-type plants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> plants exhibited reduced sensitivities to exogenously supplied ABA during both the germination and post-germination stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These observations suggest that OsDIRP1 participates in the negative feedback loop in the rice ABA-mediated drought and salt stress responses. In contrast, <italic>Ubi:OsDIRP1-sGFP</italic> showed increased tolerance to prolonged low temperature (4&#x000b0;C) treatment, as evidenced by stable growth, higher leaf chlorophyll content, and less electrolyte leakage relative to that in wild-type plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Given that plants are frequently exposed to a multitude of environmental stresses in different combinations at the same time, cross-talk between the cellular responses to individual stresses should occur in plant cells (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006</xref>). The opposite roles of OsDIRP1 in the drought/salt and cold responses suggest that OsDIRP1 is involved in negative cross-talk between these stress tolerance mechanisms. Similar observation was reported for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RING E3 ligase AtATL78. <italic>RNAi-</italic>mediated suppression of <italic>AtATL78</italic> conferred decreased drought tolerance and enhanced cold tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Kim, 2013</xref>). In addition, transgenic rice plants that ectopically overexpressed <italic>CaPUB1</italic>, a hot pepper U-box E3 Ub ligase, were hypersensitive to drought but more tolerant to cold stress than wild-type rice plants (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Min et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it appears that the ubiquitination process conducted by a single E3 Ub ligase could confer opposite results in response to different stresses. This could be due to the fact that a single E3 ligase ubiquitinates different target proteins, depending on the cellular and physiological situations (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Stone, 2018</xref>). However, the detailed mechanism underlying the opposite roles of OsDIRP1 remains to be determined.</p><p>The <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressors displayed hypersensitivity to drought and salt stresses and hyposensitivity toward ABA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but they were tolerant to prolonged cold stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, we considered the possibility that the OsDIRP1-mediated cold response is ABA-independent. This hypothesis is supported, at least in part, by the finding that the ABA-independent cold-responsive genes (<italic>OsDREB1A</italic> and <italic>OsDREB1B</italic>), but not the ABA-dependent stress-related gene (<italic>OsDREB1D</italic>), were upregulated in <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Because OsDIRP1 is mainly localized to the nucleus, it would be a possible scenario that OsDIRP1 ubiquitinates a positive nuclear factor(s) in an ABA-dependent drought/salt response and a negative nuclear factor(s) in an ABA-independent cold response, which, in turn, suppresses drought/salt-responsive genes and activates cold-associated genes, respectively. To test this hypothesis, it is essential to identify the target proteins that are ubiquitinated by OsDIRP1. Thus, we are currently attempting to isolate the target proteins of OsDIRP1.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Expression analysis of cold stress-inducible genes in wild-type and <italic>OsDIRP1</italic>-overexpressing transgenic rice plants.

However, under our experimental conditions, these knock-down progeny did not show detectable phenotypic changes in response to water deficit and low temperature when compared to the wild-type plants (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S4</xref>). These results suggest that partial suppression of <italic>OsDIRP1</italic> failed to exert detectable effects on stress tolerance. In addition, it is likely that the phenotypes of <italic>Ubi:RNAi-OsDIRP1</italic> plants were rescued by other E3 Ub ligase(s). A database search revealed that Os06g47280 is the closest homolog of OsDIRP1. However, OsDIRP1 and Os06g47280 share relatively low amino acid identity (51%; Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S1</xref>). In addition, Os06g47280 lacks the conserved Cys and Arg residues in the C-terminus of the RING domain. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the RING E3 ligase AtAIRP2 plays a combinatory role with two other non-homologous RING E3 ligases, AtAIRP1 and AtSDIR1, and complements the drought- and salt-sensitive phenotypes of <italic>atairp1</italic> and <italic>atsdir1</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 2017</xref>). A similar situation may occur in these rice stress responses; thus, it is possible that an as-yet unknown E3 ligase complements the phenotypes of <italic>Ubi:RNAi-OsDIRP1</italic> knock-down plants.</p><p>Although OsDIRP1 possesses the C-terminal RING motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), we were unable to detect <italic>in vitro</italic> E3 Ub ligase activity using a purified GST-OsDIRP1 protein (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S5</xref>). This result raises two possibilities. First is that OsDIRP1 requires a post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, for activation of its enzyme activity. In fact, OsDIRP1 is predicted to possess at least six putative phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S6</xref>). Phosphorylation was shown to be required to activate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ICE1 (Inducer of CBF Expression), SINA2 (SEVER IN ABSENTIA), and RFP34/CHYR1 (RING ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN34/CHY ZINC-FINGER AND RING PROTEIN 1) E3 ligases as well as the rice OsPUB15 E3 Ub ligase (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ding Y. et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ding S. et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Second, OsDIRP1 may not be a <italic>bona fide</italic> E3 ligase, but instead may play an unidentified role in response to environmental stimuli. It is worth noting that OsDIRP1 contains a putative beta-ketoacyl synthase active site in the N-terminal region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This second possibility, however, seems to be unlikely, as the RING motif in the OsDIRP1 is typical of many E3 ligases and highly homologous to that of other monocot RING E3 ligases (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">S1</xref>).</p><p>Rice plants frequently confront chilling injury at seedling or early vegetative stage when they are grown in early spring in temperate region, especially in the case of rainy day. In such growth conditions, it is a possible that rice plants need to turn on the mode of defense against cold stress and to repress the drought and salt responses. In conclusion, the data presented in this report indicate that OsDIRP1 is a negative regulator of drought and salt stress responses and a positive factor in the cold stress response in rice. These results further suggest that abiotic stress tolerance responses are subject to control by reciprocal and/or antagonistic cross-talk in the stress signaling pathways in higher plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LHC, HJM, MYB, and HGO performed the experiments.
