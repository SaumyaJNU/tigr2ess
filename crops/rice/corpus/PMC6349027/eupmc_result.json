    "To ensure the safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, insight into the potential impacts of CO2 leakage on the ecosystem is necessary. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effects of high soil CO2 on plant growth and the soil environment. Treatments comprised 99.99% CO2 injection (CG), 99.99% N2injection (NG), and no injection (BG). NG treatment was employed to differentiate the effects of O2 depletion from those of CO2 enrichment. Soil CO2 and O2 concentrations were maintained at an average of 53% and 11%, respectively, under CG treatment. We verified that high soil CO2 had negative effects on root water absorption, chlorophyll, starch content and total biomass. Soil microbial acid phosphatase activity was affected by CG treatment. These negative effects were attributed to high soil CO2 instead of low O2 or low pH. Our results indicate that high soil CO2 affected the root system, which in turn triggered further changes in aboveground plant tissues and rhizospheric soil water conditions. A conceptual diagram of CO2 toxicity to plants and soil is suggested to act as a useful guideline for impact assessment of CCS technology."
