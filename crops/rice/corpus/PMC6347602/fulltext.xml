This study aimed to examine whether rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> is associated with a 10-year risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) and if the association is modified by the consumption of certain food groups or nutrients. A prospective cohort study was designed using the Ansan&#x02013;Ansung data of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7,358; age &#x02265;40 years at baseline). Participants with the T allele of rs11207997, particularly TT homozygotes, had lower triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol levels than those with CC. There was no association with fasting blood glucose or other biochemical parameters. <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> mRNA was positively associated with circulating TG levels and blood pressure (all <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Cox proportional hazard models showed that the rs11207997 T allele is associated with a lower risk of DM after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.812&#x02013;0.998, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046). Furthermore, the association between rs11207997 and the risk of DM was modified by dietary factors. These associations were no longer statistically significant when additionally adjusted for baseline TG, a potential mediator. Our data suggest that genetic variation of rs11207997 in the <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> gene is associated with risk of DM, possibly through contributing to a lifelong set point of TG.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012M3A9C4048761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Min-Jeong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>funder: Natonal Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant Reference Number: 2015R1A2A1A15054758</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) represents a family of proteins that are involved in various physiological and pathological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> including lipid and glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, hematopoietic stem cell activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and cancer cell invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Among the eight ANGPTLs discovered to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, ANGPTL3 plays an important role in the regulation of plasma triglyceride<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and cholesterol levels, mainly via reversible inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Recently, ANGPTL3 has been considered an emerging target of novel drug therapy for cardiovascular disease (CVD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Deficiency of ANGPTL3 is associated with hypolipidemia and reduced risk of CVD in Caucasians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although the precise mechanism is not yet fully understood, ANGPTL3 is thought to inhibit the activity of LPL and endothelial lipase, thereby increasing blood lipid levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. ANGPTL3 levels are also associated with insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. High levels of hepatic ANGPLT3 mRNA and protein have been observed in insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Reportedly, loss-of-function mutations of <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> in Italians result in lower levels of plasma insulin and glucose as well as homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">However, the results of studies examining the involvement of ANGPTL3 in metabolic regulation are inconsistent, possibly due to differences in age and race of the study participants. For example, it has been shown that circulating ANGPTL3 levels are associated with fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR but not with triglyceride (TG) or cholesterol levels in Korean boys and girls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, whereas the association has not been investigated in Korean adults. In Chinese boys and girls, rs1748195 polymorphisms in the <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> gene are not associated with blood lipid levels, including TG, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast, among the participants of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence study, both adolescents and adults with the T minor allele of rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> had lower HDLC and apolipoprotein A-1 levels than those carrying two C alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, no further investigations regarding the influence of the genetic variation of rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> on glucose metabolism and clinical endpoints including diabetes mellitus (DM) risk have been reported.</p><p id="Par4">Based on the reported associations between ANGPLT3 and metabolic profiles, we hypothesized that rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> is associated with life-long metabolic exposure to DM. In this study, using data from the Ansan&#x02013;Ansung (urban&#x02013;rural) cohort with a median follow-up of 10 years, we prospectively examined the associations of rs11207997 with DM risk among 7,358 Korean older adults. We also investigated whether the association is modified by the consumption of certain food groups previously reported to significantly affect metabolic status and the risk of DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics of study participants</title><p id="Par5">After a median follow-up of 9.8 years, 1,168 participants (15.9%) were diagnosed with DM (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Compared with CC homozygotes, participants with the T allele of rs11207997 had lower TG and TC levels at baseline, and lower risk of DM. This genotype effect on DM risk is possibly mediated through chronically reduced levels of circulating TG. The inverse association between T minor allele of rs11207997 and DM was restricted to those with Q2 intakes of fruits, vegetables, milk, or sodium and those with relatively high (Q4) intakes of unprocessed meat.</p><p id="Par10">The specific role of rs11207997 in ANGPTL3 function and the risk of DM has not yet been elucidated. In our participants, the protective effect of the T minor allele of rs11207997 on DM-related biochemical markers (i.e., FBG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR) was not present at baseline, but T minor allele carriers had a lower risk of DM in our 10-year follow-up. The function of rs11207997 on glucose metabolism may be partly explained by the report by Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Mice lacking ANGPTL3 had a lower uptake of VLDL-TG, but fat mass was preserved by a 10-fold increase in glucose uptake and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of white adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. That is, the genetic variants of rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic>, which regulates lipid metabolism (TG and TC), may consecutively affect glucose uptake and fat accumulation in adipose tissue, resulting in future alteration in glycemic status, insulin sensitivity, and DM development. In our participants, circulating TG and TC levels at baseline were lower in participants carrying the T allele and TG was positively associated with <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> mRNA levels, regardless of genotype, and the genotypic associations were attenuated when additionally adjusted for TG. Further research is required to clarify the underlying mechanism of the genetic variants of rs11207997 on DM-related metabolic status.</p><p id="Par11">In our Korean older adult population, the effect of the genetic variants of rs11207997 on the risk of DM was also modulated by the amounts of intakes of certain types of food. Diet is associated with CVD risk, possibly through its effect on lipid and glucose metabolic profiles, systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and DM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We observed lower HRs for DM in T minor allele carriers of rs11207997 at or near the recommended intakes for fruits, vegetables, and sodium. Regarding fruit and vegetable intakes, the effect of genetic variants on the risk of DM was observed in participants in the Q2 group, which encompasses the recommended intakes for Koreans, whereas the risk of DM in those with intakes above or below the recommendations was not associated with genotype. An association between genotype and the risk of DM was evident in participants with sodium intakes slightly above the recommendations of the World Health Organization and Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans (&#x0003c;2000 mg/d), which is well below the mean sodium intake of Koreans (~4800&#x02009;mg/d<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). Caution is required in the interpretation of data regarding sodium intake. Analyzed intake data may not accurately reflect the participants&#x02019; actual intake because the Standard Tables of Food Composition of Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> was utilized to assess sodium intake, whereas sodium use may vary greatly depending on the habits of those who prepare and cook food. Thus, food intake may affect the genetic risk of DM, but the results of this study may not apply to populations with lower sodium intake.</p><p id="Par12">No specific dietary recommendations for Koreans on milk alone or unprocessed meat are available. Milk intake in our population was very low (mean intake: 1.0 serving/week), compared with the Korean recommendation of 1&#x02013;2 servings of dairy products/day. Calcium intake may not be the critical factor for the interaction effect between milk intake and genotype on the risk of DM in the present study. Milk is a good source of calcium and has been reported to affect metabolic status in association with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, approximately 14&#x02009;mg of Ca/d is provided from milk when intake is within Q2 (mean intake: 0.5 servings/week), from which a significant association between rs11207997 genotype and risk of DM was observed. It seems more likely that the interaction effect between milk intake and genotype on the risk of DM is due to other factors in milk (i.e., lactose, protein, fat, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients) rather than calcium alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, we found that the T allele of rs11207997 decreases the HR for DM when unprocessed meat consumption is relatively high (Q4). Beef, pork, chicken, and processed meat consumption were not associated with metabolic syndrome risk in Koreans using Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, but the associations may have been masked by genotype. Meat is a good source of cholesterol and saturated fat, in addition to protein, vitamins, and minerals. Although no dietary guidelines are provided for unprocessed meat alone, the mean unprocessed meat intake in the Q4 group was approximately one quarter of the current recommendations for meat, fish, eggs, and legume intakes for Koreans (4 servings/day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>). Therefore, the results of the present study may not agree with results in populations with higher milk or meat consumption.</p><p id="Par13">The food intake of participants in our study, reported from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) of 103 items, was similar to that reported in previous reports that used different methods to assess food intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

(One serving of fruit is defined by the energy content, 50&#x02009;kcal, which equals 150&#x02009;g for watermelon and strawberries, and 100&#x02009;g for most other fresh fruit and all fruit juices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.) The median fruit intake in our study population was similar (13 servings/week). Regarding mean vegetable consumption in adults 50&#x02013;64 and &#x02265;65 years old was 374&#x02009;g/d and 310&#x02009;g/d, respectively, when assessed by a 24-hour recall in the KNHANES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which equals approximately 31.5&#x02013;49 servings/week. (One vegetable serving size is 50&#x02009;kcal of vegetables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which is approximately 70&#x02009;g for most vegetables and &#x02264;40&#x02009;g for burdock, seaweeds, and mushrooms in the Korean diet.) Similarly, the median vegetable intake in our study population was 45.3 servings/week. Milk intake in our population was slightly lower than those of the Health Examinees participants. We were unable to find reports on unprocessed meat consumption in different Korean cohorts. Still, there is little evidence that food consumption of our study population could have deviated from that of normal Korean older adults.</p><p id="Par14">Our study has some limitations. First, the 10-year follow-up in adults &#x02265;40 years old may not be adequate to assess the long-term effect of exposure. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) is continuing to collect follow-up data from these adults, which may be analyzed in the future. In contrast, because the onset of type 2 DM commonly occurs around 40 years of age, the interaction between food intake and genetics needs to be examined earlier to prevent or alleviate the risk of DM. By excluding participants with DM at baseline, we may have underestimated the association and interaction by eliminating a large population that may potentially prevent or delay the onset of DM by altering food intake according to one&#x02019;s genetic variation. However, due to the lack of younger participants at baseline in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) database, we were unable to assess the genotype association with DM incidence modified by food/nutrient intake in younger populations (&#x0003c;40 years). Second, though FFQs are the most commonly used measurement for average food intake, the accuracy of FFQs may be limited due to its reliance on memory. However, in our prospective cohort study, dietary intakes were assessed prior to DM diagnosis and thus the resulting measurement error is most likely independent of outcome (i.e., non-differential) and may have only attenuated the association. Third, the function of ANGPTL3 has been reported to be closely associated with ANGPTL8, which is known to promote the ability of ANGPTL3 to bind and inhibit LPL <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, we were unable to investigate the interaction between <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> rs11207997 and <italic>ANGPTL8</italic> due to limited data. Despite these limitations, this study evaluated associations with clinical endpoint (vs. intermediate biochemical endpoints) and disease incidence (vs. prevalence) using a prospective cohort design. The prospective nature of this 10-year follow-up study reduces disease-related recall bias and further supports a possible causal effect.</p><p id="Par15">In summary, we found that among older Koreans, T allele carriers of rs11207997 in <italic>ANGPTL3</italic> had a lower risk of DM, possibly through a lifelong set point of circulating TG. In addition, among those who habitually consume fruits, vegetables, or sodium at or near the recommended intakes, adults with the T allele have lower HRs for DM than CC carriers. The association of the genetic variants of rs11207997 with the risk of DM may be masked when food or sodium intakes are far from the recommended intakes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par16">Data for this study were obtained from the Ansan&#x02013;Ansung cohort, which was part of the KoGES.
