Here, rice allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) was localized to the chloroplast and its native oligomeric structure was analyzed by gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of a protein-crosslinking reagent. The results suggest that OsAOC exists in solution as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and higher order multimers. OsAOC preferentially exists as dimer at room temperature, but it undergoes temperature-dependent partial denaturation in the presence of SDS. A heteromeric 2:1 complex of OsAOC and rice allene oxide synthase-1 (OsAOS1) was detected after cross-linking. The yield of <italic>cis</italic>(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid reached maximal saturation at a 5:1 molar ratio of OsAOC to OsAOS1, when OsAOC and OsAOS1 reactions were coupled. These results suggest that the OsAOC dimer may facilitate its interaction with OsAOS1, and that the heteromeric 2:1 complex may promote efficient channeling of the unstable allene oxide intermediate during catalysis. In addition, conceptual similarities between the reaction catalyzed by AOC and Nazarov cyclization are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>allene oxide cyclase</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>nazarov reaction</kwd><kwd>octadecanoid</kwd><kwd>oxylipin</kwd><kwd>jasmonic acid</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Research Foundation of Korea<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003725</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6592"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biosynthesis of phyto-oxlipins is initiated by lipoxygenase (LOX), which converts polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into their corresponding hydroperoxides.

Jasmonates including OPDA play important functions in plant defense (Sharma and Laxmi, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and have been proposed as important therapeutic (anti-cancer) or insect-repellent compounds (Raviv et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). OPDA, structurally similar to common cyclopenta(e)none compounds, plays important roles in development and stress response pathways in nonvascular plants, such as moss and liverwort, where JA is not found (Stumpe et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Yamamoto et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). More importantly, OPDA plays a distinct role from JA in flowering plants. For example, both OPDA and JA are induced by wounding, but only OPDA is induced by drought (Savchenko et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Global transcriptome analysis identified 172 wound-response genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> whose expression is regulated by OPDA but not JA (Taki et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In A. thaliana, OPDA also plays a key role in susceptibility to infection by root-knot nematodes (Gleason et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These results indicate that, at least in some species, OPDA plays unique roles in stress responses in plants, in addition to its importance as an intermediate in JA biosynthesis.</p><p>Rice genomes encode at least 16 LOXs, 5 AOSs, and 1 AOCs which almost identical to each other (Agrawal et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). LOX and AOS exhibit diverse substrate specificity and relatively broad regiospecificity. For example, LOX can utilize either linoleic (18:2) or linolenic (18:3) acid as a substrate to produce 9- or 13-positional isomeric hydroperoxide, which is converted into the corresponding allene oxide by AOS. However, AOC utilizes only 12,13(<italic>S</italic>)-epoxy-9(<italic>Z</italic>),11,15(<italic>Z</italic>)-octadecatrienoic acid (12,13-EOT) produced from (13<italic>S</italic>)-HPOT and stereospecifically produces <italic>cis</italic>(+)-OPDA as the only enantiomeric product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; Hofmann and Pollmann, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Mosblech et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Therefore, AOC demonstrates high substrate-and stereo-specificity and this specificity is crucial because the stereospecific cyclization of 12,13-EOT imposes the chirality at C-9 and C-13 of the cyclopentenone structure in OPDA, which in turn determines the enantiomeric configuration of JA. The unstable allene oxide substrate, 12,13-EOT, can be non-enzymatically hydrolyzed into &#x003b1;- and &#x003b3;-ketols in aqueous media, or alternatively, in the absence of AOC, it can undergo non-enyzmatic cyclization, forming racemic <italic>cis</italic>(&#x000b1;)-OPDA (dotted line; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The stereospecific cyclization of 12,13-EOT in the presence of AOC is mechanistically analogous to the stereoselective elctrocyclization of divinyl ketone in the Nazarov reaction, because stereochemical control is governed by the principles of pericyclic ring closure and because of the shared cyclopentenone structure of the reaction products (Hofmann and Pollmann, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Tius, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Therefore, the chemistry of the AOC reaction can be considered a biological analog of Nazarov cyclization in organic chemistry.</p><p>The oligomeric structure of AOC may influence its activities and the rate of flux through the JA biosynthetic pathway. Crystallographic studies revealed that AOC exists as a trimer (Hofmann et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Neumann et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) in the crystalline state, while AOC from dried corn seeds was reported to exist predominantly as a dimer in solution (Ziegler et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In this study, the oligomeric structure of OsAOC in solution was analyzed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of chemical protein cross-linking reagent BS<sup>3</sup>. Oligomeric structures of partially denatured OsAOC and an OsAOC-OsAOS1 fusion protein were also investigated. The role of dimeric OsAOC in substrate channeling and the conceptual similarity between the reaction catalyzed by AOC and Nazarov cyclization are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of proteins</title><p>Full-length OsAOC (FOsAOC, acession no.

To improve expression and protein stability, the OsAOC coding region was fused with two different leading/linker sequences in between the 6 &#x000d7; histidine epitope tag (6 &#x000d7; His-tag) and the N-terminus of OsAOC, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. The resulting plasmid constructs were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. Single-transformant derived colonies were inoculated into LB medium, grown at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking (200 rpm) to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.4&#x02013;0.6, and then induced by addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. After 7 h, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.2 mM PMSF, pH 7.5) and sonicated. The soluble protein was precipitated by ammonium sulfate with increasing saturated percentage from 20 to 50%. Salt was removed from fraction containing the recombinant OsAOCs by dialysis. The recombinant proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Q-sepharose column (Sigma) in buffer containing 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). Optionally, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phospahte, 10 mM imidazole, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, pH 8.0), sonicated, and the recombinant OsAOCs were purified by Nickel column (ProBond, Invitrogen) in the absence of EDTA. The column was eluted with buffer containing imidazole according to the method provided by supplier. If necessary, EDTA was added to the eluted fractions with final concentration of 5 mM to prevent the cleavage of TP. For cross-linking experiments, EDTA and imidazole were removed by centrifugal buffer exchange (Pall Corporation, 10K). The biochemically relevant OsAOC prepared from OsAOC(I) in the absence of EDTA was used to characterize biochemical properties. Rice allene oxide synthase-1 (OsAOS1, acession no.

OsAOC-OsAOS1 contained 13 amino acids (EFKDPSSRSAAGT) as a linker connecting two genes and 6 &#x000d7; His-tag at N- and C-termini; whereas the OsAOS1-OsAOC fusion construct did not use a linker in between the two open reading frames. The OsAOC-OsAOS1 plasmid was constructed directly by employing the NheI restriction site. The predicted lengths of the two fusion proteins are 702 and 668 amino acids with estimated molecular mass of 77.3 and 73.4 kDa for OsAOC-OsAOS1 and OsAOS1-OsAOC, respectively. Both constructs were inserted into pET-28b expression vector (Novagen) and transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3). Single colonies were inoculated into LB medium and grown at 37&#x000b0;C, 200 rpm to an optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.4&#x02013;0.6. The fusion proteins were then induced by the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 1 mM and grown for 12 h at 25&#x000b0;C with shaking (200 rpm). Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.1% Emulphogene, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) or buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.1% Emulphogene, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) for OsAOC-OsAOS1 or OsAOS1-OsAOC, respectively. OsAOC-OsAOS1 was purified by nickel column (ProBond, Invitrogen) and OsAOS1-OsAOC was purified by Q-sepharose column (Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>Gel electrophoresis and edman sequencing</title><p>SDS-PAGE and native gel electrophoresis were conducted using a protocol reported previously (Bollag et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) with 15 or 6&#x02013;15% gradient gel for SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were prepared with 0.4% SDS for denaturing or without SDS for native gel electrophoresis. N-terminal sequencing of OsAOC was performed by Life Science Laboratories (Seoul, Korea). Approximately 5 &#x003bc;g of protein was loaded and separated on a 15% acrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. Then, protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane (0.45 &#x003bc;m) using a Sigma semi-dry blotter following the supplier's protocol. The membrane was briefly washed with distilled water and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. The peptide samples were prepared by the pulsed liquid PVDF protein method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Samples were injected onto the PTH column for HPLC and detected at 269 nm using Procise software with a gradient of solvent A (3.5% tetrahydrofuran in water) and solvent B (12% isopropanol in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 325 &#x003bc;L per min in a LC 492 Protein Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Rice leaves (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.

An assay of the coupled OsAOC-OsAOS1 reaction was conducted as follows.

Native gel electrophoresis (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3A</xref>) revealed that three recombinant OsAOC variants have distinct electrophoretic mobilities. OsAOC(I) and OsAOC(II), which lack the TP, exhibited a molecular mass of 146&#x02013;480 kDa during electrophoresis under native conditions. In contrast, full length OsAOC(III), which retained the TP, did not enter the gel matrix.

Oligomeric structures of OsAOC were further characterized in detail after cross-linking with BS<sup>3</sup> (11.4 &#x000c5;) followed by SDS-PAGE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Diverse oligomeric structures were observed, including monomer, dimer, and higher multimers, depending the ratio of OsAOC to cross-linker. Dimeric forms began to appear at a 1:5 molar ratio of protein to cross-linker and higher multimers increased in abundance with increasing ratio of cross-linker to protein, with similar results for all three variants of OsAOC. However, higher multimers of OsAOC(III), which retains the TP, were more abundant than, higher multimers of OsAOC(I), which lacks the TP.

Therefore, in order to investigate possible interactions between OsAOC and OsAOS1, the stereospecificity and yield of catalysis by OsAOC(I) was first examined at a variable molar ratio of OsAOC(I) to OsAOS1. The results show that yield of <italic>cis</italic>(+)-OPDA increased hyperbolically with increasing molar excess of OsAOC(I) to OsAOS1, reaching saturation at an approximate ratio of 5:1 [OsAOC(I):OsAOS1; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>]. This is consistent with the idea that OsAOS1 and OsAOC facilitate efficient channeling of the allene oxide intermediate 12,13-EOT. Additional support for this possibility comes from our evidence that OsAOC(I) and OsAOS1 form a heteromeric protein complex after co-incubation in the presence of BS<sup>3</sup>. Western blot analysis indicated a band corresponding to molecular weight &#x02248;100 kDa, which could tentatively be assigned as a 2:1 heteromeric complex of OsAOC(I) and OsAOS1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). To investigate the putative interaction between OsAOC and OsAOS1, fusion proteins of OsAOC and OsAOS1 were designed as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>, and their oligomeric structures were analyzed under denaturing and partially-denaturing conditions. Unfortunately, the OsAOC-OsAOS1 fusion protein was not active (data not shown). This could indicate that the co-linear arrangement of OsAOC N-terminal to OsAOS1 does not support formation of an active protein conformation. However, under partially-denaturing conditions, an OsAOS1-OsAOC fusion protein did assume a mixed oligomeric state, which included monomers, dimers and other multimers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The OsAOS1-OsAOC fusion protein was readily spliced into OsAOS1 and OsAOC monomers, as expected based on previous results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Possible interaction between OsAOC and OsAOS1. <bold>(A)</bold> Yield of OPDA with increasing molar ratios of OsAOC(I) to OsAOS1.

To gain insight into the subunit conformation and arrangement in these multimers, bioinformatic tools were used to generate a structural model for OsAOC mixed multimers. First, SWISS-Model (Biasini et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) was used to automatically model OsAOC with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AOC2 as a template. The algorithm predicted that the transit peptide-excluded OsAOC exists as a homotrimer. In order to model oligomers of OsAOC, an OsAOC monomer was manually generated from the homotrimer using PyMol and then used as input to Galaxy Gemini (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=GEMINI">http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=GEMINI</ext-link>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which results in modeling of dimeric or trimeric structure of OsAOC. The predicted structural similarity values from Galaxy Gemini modeling are shown in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Homotrimeric structures were predicted with AtAOC2 (2BRJ), PpAOC1 (4H6B), and dirigent protein DRR206 (4REV), but a homodimer was predicted with Diels-Alderase PyrI4 (5BU3) as a template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

Consistent with this, confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that OsAOC is localized to the chloroplast in rice leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as intact precursor polypeptides, where they interact with molecular chaperones HSP70, HSP90, and 14-3-3 proteins. The molecular chaperones prevent protein mis-folding and/or aggregation (Soll and Schleiff, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The OsAOC presequence/TP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) appears to be removed by metal ion-dependent cleavage, because the splicing of presequence and/or TP was prevented by EDTA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). A similar reaction occurs in the OsAOS1-OsAOC fusion protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Self-cleavage of precursor AOC has been reported previously (Kong et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Phyre<sup>2</sup> predicted that the relatively hydrophobic TP in OsAOC(III) forms an &#x003b1;-helix that is well-separated from the core &#x003b2;-barrel (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S6B</xref>). We speculate that auto-cleavage occurs at the junction between this &#x003b1;-helix and the core &#x003b2;-barrel.</p><p>Indeed, protease specificity prediction server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://prosper.erc.monash.edu.au">https://prosper.erc.monash.edu.au</ext-link>) predicted three cleavage sites of matrix metallopeptidase-2 in the recombinant OsAOCs, including the position between S and L that is located at third residue from the TP cleavage site. The cleavage site located in the boundary region between a hydrophobic &#x003b1;-helix of TP and &#x003b2;-barrel core structure of OsAOC may provide an easy to access for a metallopeptidase to the cleavage sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Oligomeric state</title><p>Previous crystallographic studies report a trimeric structure for AOC (Hofmann et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Neumann et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Consistent with this, structural analysis presented here, including native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration in the absence or presence of protein cross-linking reagent, demonstrate that OsAOC exists as a mixture of multimers in solution (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, S3, S4). The homodimer appears to be a preferred conformation for OsAOC. The OsAOC homodimer was detected by Western blot after extensive dilution, suggesting that it reflects a specific intramolecular interaction between two OsAOC monomers. This is consistent with the observation that OsAOC homodimers persist after partial denaturation in 0.4% SDS at room temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The population distribution of OsAOC oligomers was dependent on the temperature. The OsAOC dimer is the predominant form at room temperature under partially-denaturing conditions. Consistent with this, OsAOC is predicted to have a core &#x003b2;-barrel, and &#x003b2;-sheet proteins are reported to be relatively resistant to SDS-induced kinetic instability and protein unfolding (Manning and Colon, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Nielsen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Using Diels-Alderase protein as a template, bioinformatics modeling predicted OsAOC to be a dimer (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Furthermore, a structural search based on the &#x003b2;-barrel structure of Diels-Aderase (PyrI<sup>4</sup>) found that the PyrI<sup>4</sup> and AOC (4H6A) are structural homologs (Zheng et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It is interesting that both enzymes catalyze pericyclic reactions: a [4 + 2] cycloaddition is catalyzed by Diel-Alderase and 4&#x003c0; electrocyclization is catalyzed by AOC. In addition, AOC can be classified as a dirigent protein, because of its characteristic &#x003b2;-barrel structure and its stereospecificity (Pickel et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our previous studies indicated that rice allene oxide synthase (OsAOS1) is in the dynamic equilibrium among diverse oligomeric structures and its subunit structure strongly depends on the presence of detergents <italic>in vitro</italic> (Yoeun et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These data suggest that oligomerization of OsAOS1 could be regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> through protein-lipid interactions in or near the membrane. This is consistent with other studies suggesting that membrane-protein interactions involving AOS facilitate transfer of highly unstable allene oxide intermediates for the cyclization into cyclopentanone derivatives in the oxylipin biosynthetic pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate channeling</title><p>The AOC gene family in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> includes four functional genes, AtAOC1, AtAOC2, AtAOC3 and AtAOC4, and heteromerization among these isozymes has been proposed as a mechanism of regulating AOC activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (Stenzel et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Otto et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Here, we propose that multimers and/or heteromultimers of OsAOS1 and OsAOC may facilitate interactions between the two enzymes and influence their capacity for substrate channeling during catalysis. As mentioned above, this would protect the 12,13-EOT intermediate, and prevent its premature dissolution, by effectively coupling catalysis in the active sites of OsAOC and OsAOS1. We previously reported a substrate channeling effect, when OsAOC and OsAOS1 were immobilized on nanoporous rice husk silica (Le et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Data presented here also demonstrate a hyperbolic dependence of OsAOC reaction yield on the molar ratio of OsAOC to OsAOS1, and this is consistent with the proposed substrate channeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Western blot analysis of cross-linked multimers suggest the possible formation of a 2:1 heterotrimer (MW &#x02248;100 kDa) comprised of one OsAOC dimer and one OsAOS1 monomer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), although we can't completely exclude the possibility that the 100 kDa species is tetrameric OsAOC or dimeric OsAOS1. Dimeric OsAOC appears to be the predominant oligomeric form of OsAOC in solution, and in association with OsAOS1, even though OsAOC is reported to form homotrimers during crystallization (Hofmann et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Neumann et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Unlike <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, rice cells express one isoform of AOC from a single AOC gene (Dhakarey et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, multimers that include more than one enzyme isoform can form in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> but not in rice. As mentioned above, we propose that dimeric OsAOC interacts with monomeric OsAOS1 to form a heterotrimer [(OsAOC)<sub>2</sub>OsAOS1], and that this heterotrimer is required for efficient substrate channeling during catalysis.</p></sec><sec><title>AOC as a biologically analogous nazarov cyclase</title><p>AOC catalyzes the conversion of the allene oxide into the &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated cyclopetenone with stereospecific cyclization.
