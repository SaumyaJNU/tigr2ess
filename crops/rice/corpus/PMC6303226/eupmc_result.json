    "BACKGROUND:GPI-anchoring is a prevalent Glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification process of posttranslational protein and is necessary for cell wall integrity in eukaryotes. To date, the function of GPI anchored-related protein remains unknown in phytopathogenic fungi. RESULTS:We here characterized the functions of MoPer1, a homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScPer1, from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that MoPER1 was significantly upregulated during conidiation and infection. We found that the ∆Moper1 mutant was defective in conidiation and appressoria formation, and MoPer1 was involved in osmotic stress response and maintaining the cell wall integrity. Pathogenicity assays indicated that deletion of MoPEP1 significant reduction in virulence. Microscopic examination of the lesions revealed that the invasive hyphae of ∆Moper1 mutants were mostly restricted to the primary infected leaf sheath cells. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicated that MoPer1 is necessary for growth, conidiogenesis, and pathogenicity of the fungus. Our study facilitated to deep elucidate the pathogenic molecular mechanism of M. oryzae, and also provided a very helpful reference value for developing effective fungicide pointed at as the gene for target."
