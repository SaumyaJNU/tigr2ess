The main components of the fungal cell wall are glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Part of the cell wall protein must be anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) after translated, and then bound to the cell wall to perform its normal biological function (Bernard and Latge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>; Bowman and Free, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Free, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). GPI anchors, which generally contain four core components: ethanolamine phosphate, mannose, glucosamine and phosphatidylinositol, which are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After being linked to the target protein, the lipid moieties will be further reconstructed by a series of modifications, mainly including three steps, inositol deacylation is performed first, then the acyl chain at the sn-2 site of the diacylglycerol is cleaved to form a lyso-GPI, and finally introduce a saturated 26-carbonyl chain at the sn-2 site (Orlean and Menon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Fujita and Jigami, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>; Fujita and Kinoshita, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>). Genes involved in this process have been characterized in mammals and yeast.</p><p id="Par5">In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, after GPI anchored to the target protein, the acyl group of its inositol residue is removed by the inositol deacylase Bst1. Deletion of the <italic>BST1</italic> gene delays the formation of GPI-anchored proteins (Tanaka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>; Fujita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006b</xref>). In the second step, the acyl chain at the sn-2 site is cleaved by the Per1 (processing in the ER) protein which performs the function of GPI phospholipase A2 and then lyso-GPI is formed (Fujita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006a</xref>). Biological function of the Per1 is similar to Bst1, which is also necessary for the maturation of GPI-anchored proteins and loss of these two genes caused defects to the integrity of cell wall. In addition, Per1 also plays a very important role in the transport of GPI-anchored proteins (Fujita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006a</xref>). Following the formation of lyso-GPI, the 26-carbon fatty acid is linked to the sn-2 site under the action of the Gup1 protein (Sipos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>). Lipid moieties are modified and the mature GPI-anchored protein adheres to the cell wall to perform a series of biological functions including cell signaling transduction, cell-cell information exchange, cell adhesion and host defense response (Kinoshita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1995</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">To date, except <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the function of GPI-anchored proteins in the lipid remodeling process in fungi is only reported in the human pathogenic filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. Deletion of <italic>AfPERA</italic>, a homlogues gene of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae PER1</italic>, growth was slower, the produce of conidia was reduced, resistance to triazole fungicides was enhanced and toxicity to mice was lost in the <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (Chung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). Further study found that the cell wall components of &#x00394;<italic>AfperA</italic> mutant changed, and the content of beta-glucan and chitin increased, leading to significant influence on cell wall integrity (Chung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). Although it is recognized that lipid remodeling of GPI-anchored proteins plays an important role in the cell wall integrity of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, the biological functions have not been reported in plant pathogenic fungi.</p><p id="Par7">Rice blast, caused by <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, is a destructive disease during rice cultivation that severely threatens the production of rice crops worldwide (Talbot, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>; Dean et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). Here, we define MoPer1, a ScPer1 homologue of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, and for the first time elucidate its function in phytopathogenic fungi.

Conidial suspensions of 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;l (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup> spores/ml) were dropped onto a hydrophobic surface and placed in a moistened box at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>).

The disease severity was assessed at 7&#x02009;days after inoculation. Approximately 6&#x02009;cm long diseased rice blades were photographed to evaluate the virulence of the mutants (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Similar spray inoculation with conidia (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> conidia/ml in 0.2% gelatin) was used for injection inoculation.
