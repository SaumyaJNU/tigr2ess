In parts of Bangladesh, arsenic bioaccumulation and resulting diseases are the greatest cause of mortality.

From 2002 to 2015, the number of deaths from diarrhea decreased by 55%.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, childhood mortality remains high in part because only 53% of Cambodians have &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; drinking water.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 1999, high concentrations of arsenic were found in Cambodian groundwater and by 2006, the first cases of arsenicosis in Cambodia were reported.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As with bacterial contamination of water, management of arsenic in water needs improvement. The country standard for arsenic in drinking water is 50 &#x003bc;g/L<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, whereas the World Health Organization guideline is 10 &#x003bc;g/L.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Initially, Cambodia had few resources capable of measuring 10 &#x003bc;g/L of arsenic and the risks associated with bacterial contamination were considered to be more serious than 50 &#x003bc;g/L of arsenic.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Both of these problems remain but have been improved. Currently, many farmers believe that if their wells have no more than 50 &#x003bc;g/L of arsenic, they do not have to collect rainwater or take other steps to reduce their arsenic intake. Moreover, some wells are also used for irrigation which results in bioaccumulation of arsenic into rice.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>There are over 2.4 million people living in the arsenic-contaminated zone of Cambodia.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the most affected areas, people try to reduce their intake of arsenic, but most of the farmers in these areas consume water and food from their land on a daily basis. Over 100,000 people are at high risk of chronic arsenic exposure.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Documented effects can be as subtle as impairment of intellectual development in children or extreme, including amputations of limbs to remove cancerous growths.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Congenital birth defects and mortality from arsenic are also well known. The most serious source of arsenic toxicity is from drinking groundwater rich in arsenic. In some of the most contaminated sites, safe drinking water is now being provided. However, secondary sources of arsenic, such as arsenic that has bioaccumulated in crops are also a concern. In areas of Bangladesh with good drinking water, consumption of rice with more than 200 &#x003bc;g/kg of arsenic is associated with significantly higher levels of cancer.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Some rice in the present study site has twice this threshold for cancer induction, while in comparison some rice in India and Bangladesh contains five times this threshold for cancer induction.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Irrigation with groundwater is more extensive and has been used over twice as long in Bangladesh compared to Cambodia.

These new approaches should be effective, but also sensitive to local conditions in developing countries. Farmers in the main research site in the present study are concerned about their health and rarely eat rice that they grow with groundwater. However, some farmers became very concerned that our research could interfere with their ability to sell rice. While Cambodia has a very similar environment to Bangladesh, irrigation with groundwater has not taken place nearly as long or extensively in Cambodia as it has in Bangladesh. The objectives of the present study are to characterize the concentrations of all major arsenic species in rice collected from different sites in Cambodia that used three irrigation methods, conduct interviews with farmers on their farming practices and to explore potential changes in irrigation methods to reduce arsenic concentrations in rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f01">Figure 1</xref> shows the study area and was prepared by Resource Development International from more than 10,000 analyses of wells.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The arsenic content of the groundwater varies from extremes in Preak Russey on the Bassac River to low to moderate levels of arsenic in groundwater near the Mekong River in a control site we called Kandal.

By chance, a farmer was discovered pumping groundwater from his well, first into a ditch and then later onto his rice field (sample site Preak Russey-4) in the belief that this process would cleanse the water. The ditch was 200 m long. Sampling took place about 180 m from the pump. Another farmer was discovered by chance that first pumped groundwater from a well into a ditch prior to irrigating his rice paddy (site Preak Russey-1) that was about 80 m away. Later, a third farmer (site Preak Russey-10) used the insights from this study (as discussed below) and adopted this strategy of pumping groundwater from his well into a ditch prior to irrigation of his fields. His ditch was &#x0003e;500 m long, but sampling occurred in the first 100 m only. These ditches were about 4 m wide and up to 2 m deep. The farmers added no chemicals to the irrigation water. No aeration was used, except for naturally occurring oxidation. The only physical action that occurred was the introduction of nets to impede fish from entering the water pumps, but the nets also acted as a physical surface for periphyton growth and aided establishment of a layer of floating aquatic plants (mostly water hyacinth, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eichhornia crassipes</named-content>). The floating plants impeded transport of floating orange scum to the pumps. Furthermore, no efforts were made to remove brush from the ditches which also acted as substrate for periphyton growth and impeded transport of floating scum to the pumps. Water samples were collected once from the ditches of Preak Russey-4 and once from Preak Russey-10. Sample collection was restricted by the timing of irrigation, weather and our awareness of the situation. Once the rains had begun, well water in the ditches was diluted to unknown amounts. Sampling was avoided if rain had occurred the week before a visit. When the rains became vigorous, irrigation stopped.</p><p>The floating orange scum was collected and freeze dried at the Fisheries Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia. Metals were determined in the scum by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis using the Camcontrol XRF analyzer (Niton XL3tGOLDD) and certified reference standards from Thermo Fisher Scientific.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Statistical analyses used Excel and VassarStats.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The average total arsenic content of rice and water (field wells) in Preak Russey was 315&#x000b1;150 &#x003bc;g/kg and 959&#x000b1;351 &#x003bc;g/L vs. 158&#x000b1;33 &#x003bc;g/kg and 65&#x000b1;51 &#x003bc;g/L, respectively, in Kandal (Table 2, Appendix 2 in the IDRC report).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f02">Figure 2</xref> shows a significant relationship (p&#x0003e; 0.01) between the content of arsenic in irrigation water and the total arsenic content of rice collected in 2016. The data set that is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f02">Figure 2</xref> lacks paired data from some farms, because at times farmers declined to provide rice samples. The rice with the most arsenic contamination was from site Preak Russey-13, a farm without a ditch for irrigation with surface water. With the Preak Russey-13 data removed, the r<sup>2</sup> improved from 0.530 to 0.681. Rice from site Preak Russey-13 contained as much as six times the total arsenic as rice in farms with the lowest concentrations. The total arsenic level from site Preak Russey-13 was 598 &#x003bc;g/kg, which is very close to levels reported by Phan et al. in the worst samples from Preak Russey (578 &#x003bc;g/kg).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For Preak Russey-13's second crop of rice, the farmer could only use groundwater for irrigation. When farmers have a choice, as they do early in the season, they use surface water, as they are aware of the problem with arsenic in groundwater. A t-test indicates that this comparison of samples is significant (p = 0.0045). There are other variables involved, but this indicates that the effect of using surface water rather than groundwater with &#x0003e;1000 &#x003bc;g/L of arsenic is important. There was one matched pair of samples. Site Preak Russey-2 has a ditch; the first crop (March 19, 2016) of rice had 329 &#x003bc;g/kg of total arsenic, while the second crop (July 26, 2016) with mostly groundwater irrigation had 417 &#x003bc;g/kg of total arsenic. There are other aspects of irrigation that illustrate the importance of avoiding use of groundwater. The total arsenic content of rice grown at site Preak Russey-4 (187 &#x003bc;g/kg) was the second lowest observed at Preak Russey; site Preak Russey-4 is where the farmer used a treatment ditch which effectively removed 99% of the arsenic (Table 1, Appendix 2 in the IDRC report, and as discussed below).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In Preak Russey, rice with the lowest total arsenic content (147 &#x003bc;g/kg, Preak Russey-15) was always grown completely with surface water.</p><fig id="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Total arsenic in rice versus total arsenic in irrigation water</p><p>PR13 is Preak Russey-13.

The present study mainly sampled brown rice, i.e. not yet polished. Brown rice stores much longer, so it is the most common rice for farmers.

Most of the farmers did not have polished rice. However, we were able to collect nine samples of both polished and brown rice from eight farms.

Significantly, this calculation results in rice from site Preak Russey-13 being within 1% of the Codex guidelines. This calculation is only an estimation and does not take into account the greater content of DMA in rice with higher total arsenic. The only polished rice sample collected from a farm with high total arsenic, Preak Russey-2, contained 138 &#x003bc;g/kg inorganic arsenic (Table 4, Appendix 2 in the IDRC report)<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and would pass the more stringent Chinese guideline discussed by Meharg et al.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The ratio of inorganic arsenic to total arsenic in site Preak Russey-2 polished rice is lower than other polished rice (0.55, Table 4, Appendix 2 in the IDRC report).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Rice bran in Preak Russey was rich in inorganic arsenic (494&#x000b1;119 &#x003bc;g/kg, n=9) and is used as fish and animal feed (Table 5, Appendix 2 in the IDRC report).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> More data on polished rice and rice bran are needed from farms in Preak Russey with high levels of total arsenic.</p><p>Significantly, the two sample sites with rice with the highest total inorganic arsenic, Preak Russey-2 and Preak Russey-13, had high concentrations of DMA or cacodylic acid in rice (170 and 306 &#x003bc;g/kg, respectively). The replication on duplicates for the DMA content of Preak Russey-13 was excellent (313 and 299 &#x003bc;g/kg). Because DMA is organic arsenic, at present the Preak Russey-13 rice meets export guidelines.</p><p>The variability of arsenic levels in rice between farms is large and it is possible for a polished rice sample to fail the current Codex or Chinese guidelines. Without improvements in arsenic management, farms that continue to extensively use groundwater for irrigation could result in rice at Preak Russey that exceeds Codex guidelines. Mixing of rice from sites like Preak Russey-13 site with other farms could alleviate the risk of blocked sales, but the best strategy would be to avoid using groundwater irrigation as much as possible. Building ditches for rainwater storage is an effective initial strategy and readily fits into the need for drainage at the end of the rainy season as well. Water treatment for groundwater irrigation should also be considered.</p><sec><title>Arsenic removal in irrigation</title><p>The arsenic in irrigation wells was highly reactive and bioavailable.

Studies in Bangladesh suggest that the slow build-up of arsenic in soils relative to the application input rate from irrigation suggests that most of the arsenic from irrigation is removed in the rainy season.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This likely is a very important flux of arsenic, but it is possible that some of the gas produced in the treatment ditch or fields is trimethyl arsine (TMA) gas which could be vented to the atmosphere.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;37</xref></p><p>Iron can be readily seen floating in flocs in the paddy fields and treatment ditches (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f05">Figure 5</xref></italic>). The floc floats because of gas production. The mean iron and arsenic content of this freeze-dried floc was 26,000&#x000b1;239 and 125&#x000b1;8 mg/kg, respectively (n=3). The ratio of iron to arsenic in the floc from Preak Russey-10 was 208/1, whereas the ratio of iron to arsenic in the Preak Russey-10 well was 16/1 (well water 16742 &#x003bc;g/L iron and 1044 &#x003bc;g/L arsenic). The enrichment of iron in the floc was substantial. Using the ratio of iron to arsenic in the well water and multiplying it by iron in the floc, either 87% of the arsenic volatilized (likely as trimethyl arsine, TMA) or an enriched arsenic precipitant formed and was not observed. The XRF analysis of arsenic and iron at these high concentrations is quite reliable (Appendix 3 in the IDRC report).<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The most likely explanation is volatilization of TMA and direct analysis of the gases collected over the treatment ditch should be considered.</p><fig id="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f05" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Treatment ditch Preak Russey-4</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-f05"/></fig><p>Further evaluation of the effectiveness of a treatment ditch in removing arsenic is needed. Further analysis was not possible due to funding and project duration constraints. Based on the results of the present study, farmers were advised not to use groundwater, so they rebuilt an irrigation ditch to access water from the Bassac River. There was no funding to redirect their efforts and the dry season of 2016&#x02013;2017 was wet enough that farmers did not need to irrigate with groundwater. Some aspects of the treatment ditch would best be evaluated in a controlled experiment on a farm that was rented for at least a three-year period. Evaluation of the toxicity of irrigation water compared to treated water could only be performed in such an experimental design. Likewise, the effects of irrigation water on arsenic bioaccumulation in rice varieties and soil is best carried out with control over all aspects of farming procedures. The cost of land rental, technical direction and field help is minor compared to the potential significance of continuing to produce rice with arsenic. Long-term monitoring is required to assess any potential accumulation of arsenic in ditches and mobilization of arsenic into fields.</p><p>Most farmers understand that ditches improve storage/access to surface water and produce rice with lower arsenic concentrations. Education and management are needed, along with an increase in the number of ditches. Furthermore, although treatment ditches effectively remove arsenic, to optimize their use, the mechanism of arsenic removal must be fully understood. The likely mechanism of volatilization of TMA could be evaluated with silver nitrate traps. Gas trapping of TMA should be evaluated in treatment ditches, rice paddies and in air near rice paddies. Likely TMA production is substantial in the rice paddies and optimization of TMA production in treatment ditches does not change volatilization of arsenic in the general area. Dilution of TMA is likely considerable, but assessment of ambient air near the rice paddies could help manage health concerns through appropriate risk assessment of relevant exposures, including combustion of rice husks and rice stubble.</p><p>Although even the most contaminated rice from the study area is legal for export, there remains a growing concern about arsenic in rice. In 2014, Dr. Andy Meharg stated that &#x0201c;standards need to be set to protect those most at risk and 50 ppb for children and 100 ppb for all rice products would be achievable with concerted effort of regulators and industry, though - as every dose of inorganic arsenic carries a risk - the lower the better.&#x0201d;<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> On January 1, 2016, the standard for arsenic in children's food in the European Union was reduced to 100 ppb and subsequently has been effectively managed.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> By comparison, there is no equivalent arsenic standard for children in Asia. One farmer in Preak Russey stated that arsenic is responsible for his 10-year old child being unable to sit up without support since birth. He drives more than 5 hours from his rice farm to buy rice. This is anecdotal evidence, but consistent with arsenic exposure found in this area and documentation on other health issues such as amputations of cancerous limbs caused by arsenic in this area of Cambodia.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Using the same intake calculation method as was applied to a study area 40 km from Preak Russey, but substituting the inorganic arsenic content of rice from Preak Russey (mean of 11 farms 202.5&#x000b1;42 &#x003bc;g/kg, 45 samples) and the mean inorganic arsenic content in water from Preak Russey (23 wells 883&#x000b1;332 &#x003bc;g/L), this calculation indicates that the provision of high quality drinking water in 2015 to Preak Russey removed about 95% of the dietary (inorganic) arsenic exposure.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-19-180911-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Prior to 2015, drinking water was a 23-times greater source of inorganic arsenic than rice. The current dietary intake of arsenic at Preak Russey could be more accurately measured, but the importance of the new water supply would not change significantly. These extremes in arsenic toxicity that are still obvious in farmers in Preak Russey should become less common. Further clarification may be best performed by analysis of current level of arsenic in blood and urine in farmers in Preak Russey, with associated health analysis and interviews. In this region, it is important to better characterize the risk of arsenic exposure from rice consumption by conducting arsenic speciation analysis on a more routine basis. Dietary advice or regulation should be based on the concentrations of specific arsenic species. It is important to educate farmers on irrigation methods that can reduce arsenic accumulation in rice. Risk communication, especially with regard to water consumption is also of vital importance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Unlike in Bangladesh, rice with the highest total arsenic concentrations in Cambodia contained mostly organic arsenic, DMA, which is unregulated and much less toxic than inorganic arsenic. Analysis of arsenic species in a greater variety of rice in Cambodia is necessary to characterize the health risk of consumption and for regulation purposes. Storing surface runoff or groundwater in ditches prior to irrigation can significantly reduce the arsenic concentration in rice. Properly designed ditches or holding ponds can remove &#x0003e; 95% arsenic from groundwater prior to irrigation. The mechanism of arsenic removal should be resolved to facilitate treatment optimization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="hapn-8-19-180911_s01.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by the International Development Research Centre, IDRC Project No: 107718-00020799-032.
