    "Leaf senescence is a genetically controlled process that involves the perception of extracellular signals and signal transduction. The receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) are known to act as an important class of cell surface receptors and are involved in multiple biological processes such as development and stress responses. The functions of a number of RLK members have been characterized in Arabidopsis and other plant species, but only a limited number of RLK proteins have been reported to be associated with leaf senescence. In the present study, we have characterized the role of the somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 4 (SERK4) gene in leaf senescence. The expression of SERK4 was up-regulated during leaf senescence and by several abiotic stress treatments in Arabidopsis. The serk4-1 knockout mutant was found to display a significant early leaf senescence phenotype. Furthermore, the results of overexpression analysis and complementary analysis supported the idea that SERK4 acts as a negative regulator in the process of leaf senescence."
