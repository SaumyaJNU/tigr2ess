LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are the predominant interspersed repeat that is poorly assembled in draft genomes. Here, we propose a reference-free genome metric called LTR Assembly Index (LAI) that evaluates assembly continuity using LTR-RTs. After correcting for LTR-RT amplification dynamics, we show that LAI is independent of genome size, genomic LTR-RT content, and gene space evaluation metrics (i.e., BUSCO and CEGMA). By comparing genomic sequences produced by various sequencing techniques, we reveal the significant gain of assembly continuity by using long-read-based techniques over short-read-based methods. Moreover, LAI can facilitate iterative assembly improvement with assembler selection and identify low-quality genomic regions. To apply LAI, intact LTR-RTs and total LTR-RTs should contribute at least 0.1% and 5% to the genome size, respectively. The LAI program is freely available on GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever">https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever</ext-link>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1121650</award-id><award-id>IOS-1126998</award-id><award-id>IOS-1740874</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Michigan State University</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100007709</named-content></funding-source><award-id>MICL02408</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the shotgun sequencing era, the assembly of a new genome is mostly reliant on computational algorithms. The performance of such algorithms, as well as read length, insertion size of sequencing libraries, read accuracy,&#x000a0;and genome complexity, determine the accuracy and continuity of the genome assembly. Therefore, the quality of a genome assembly is hardly predictable. To evaluate the quality of a new assembly, several methods have been developed, which include contig size measurements, gene set completeness, misassembly evaluation, and synteny comparison. The contig N50, which is the shortest contig length at 50% of the total genome size, is widely used to estimate assembly continuity but could be misleading if short contigs are artificially concatenated (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Similarly, scaffold N50 is a metric to reflect the continuity of a genome scaffold. Currently, the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) and Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) programs represent the &#x02018;state-of-the-art&#x02019; methods for evaluation of gene space quality through the evaluation of presence or absence of numerous highly conserved orthologous genes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, most newly assembled genomes (including draft genomes) are associated with high BUSCO and CEGMA scores, which is not sufficient to reveal the completeness of the whole genome. In contrast, the QUAST program compares genome assembler programs by estimating misassemblies in contig blocks (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which is limited however by the availability of a reference genome.</p><p>Due to the repetitive nature of transposable elements (TEs), their assembly is notoriously difficult and unreliable (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, TEs are major components of most eukaryotic genomes and often interact with genes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). To date, there are no established metrics available for the evaluation of repetitive sequence space (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are interspersed repetitive elements that typically range from 4 to 20 Kb and dominate most plant genomes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Upon insertion, the long terminal repeat of the element is identical to each other, then base substitution will occur randomly and constantly on the LTR region based on the neutral theory, which can be used to infer the age of the insertion event (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Deletion will also occur on LTR-RTs due to intra-element unequal homologous recombination and illegitimate recombination (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Both substitution and deletion can alter the sequence and the structure of an intact LTR-RT, and eventually lead to degradation or removal (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Intra-element recombination is thought to be the major process facilitating the removal of LTR sequence in genomes of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), resulting in the formation of solo LTRs that consist of only one of the LTR regions.</p><p>Identification of LTR elements using computer programs based on structural features is efficient (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), yet suffering from large numbers of false positives (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recently, the LTR_retriever software was developed for accurate <italic>de novo</italic> identification of intact LTR retrotransposons (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This tool eliminates LTR false positives regardless of the input quality and has demonstrated ultrahigh sensitivity and accuracy with very low false discovery rate (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). While searching plant genomes for intact LTR elements, we observed that more intact elements could be identified from more completed genome assemblies compared with draft genomes. For example, there were 2,052 intact LTR-RTs retrieved from the well-assembled rice reference genome &#x02018;Nipponbare&#x02019; (MSUv7 version), while only 239 intact LTR-RTs could be identified from the same genome sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique (the assembly was obtained from (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)). Jiao <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>&#x000a0;reported similar findings in the new maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) reference genome (v4) sequenced by PacBio long-read techniques (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Al-Dous <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>&#x000a0;also showed that short-read-based genome sequencing could resolve only a small fraction of long repeats like LTR-RTs in the date palm (<italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic>) genome (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These findings suggest that a more continuous genome assembly would result in more intact LTR elements being identified. Thus, the amount of identifiable intact LTR elements, in turn, can indicate the assembly quality of the intergenic and repetitive sequence space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Collection of whole-genome sequences</title><p>A total of 103 genomes were collected and used in this study.

In this study, LTR-RT candidates were obtained using LTRharvest (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) with parameters &#x02018;-minlenltr 100 -maxlenltr 7000 -mintsd 4 -maxtsd 6 -motif TGCA -motifmis 1 -similar 85 -vic 10 -seed 20 -seqids yes&#x02019; and LTR_FINDER (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) with parameters &#x02018;-D 15000 -d 1000 -L 7000 -l 100 -p 20 -C -M 0.85&#x02019;. Both of these parameter sets were requiring minimum and maximum LTR length of 100 bp and 7 Kb, respectively, with at least 85% identity between two LTR regions of a candidate. High-confidence LTR retrotransposons with perfect micro-structures of terminal motifs and target site duplication (the &#x02018;pass&#x02019; category) were identified from LTR-RT candidates using LTR_retriever (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) with default parameters, which were regarded as intact LTR retrotransposons. All possible LTR sequences in a given genome were annotated by RepeatMasker using the non-redundant LTR-RT library constructed by LTR_retriever and with parameters &#x02018;-e ncbi -q -no_is -norna -nolow -div 40 -cutoff 225&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Estimation of raw LAI was performed using the equation Raw LAI = (Intact LTR element length / Total LTR sequence length) * 100, which was carried out by the LAI program deployed in the LTR_retriever package with window size set to 3 Mb and sliding step set to 300 Kb (&#x02018;-window 3000000 -step 300000&#x02019;). The whole-genome raw LAI score is also generated in this procedure.</p><p>Since the raw LAI score is correlated with the activities of LTR-RT (see Results), such as LTR-RT amplification and removal, the mean identity of LTR sequences of the monoploid (1&#x000d7;) genome was used to correct these effects. To estimate the mean identity of LTRs, genomic sequences annotated as LTR regions were extracted and subjected to all-versus-all BLAST. The identity of each sequence hit that has the highest query coverage (except self-alignment) was used to estimate the whole-genome LTR identity. The correction factor of 2.8138 estimated using 20 high-quality long-read genomes was used to correct raw LAI scores with the equation LAI = raw LAI + 2.8138 &#x000d7; (94 &#x02013; whole genome LTR identity). The LAI is set to 0 when raw LAI = 0 or the adjustment produces a negative value. Estimation of LTR identity and correction of raw LAI were also carried out by the LAI program. The mean age of intact LTR-RTs estimated by LTR_retriever was also used as an indicator of LTR-RT activity, but the age could be overestimated in draft genomes since young LTR-RTs are among the most poorly assembled. Although LAI is independent of total LTR-RT content, estimation of LAI is empirically not accurate when total LTR-RT content is less than 5% and intact LTR-RT content is less than 0.1%. To control for abnormally high LAI score, the regional LAI is down-scaled to 10% of the original score when total LTR-RT content is less than 1% in both whole-genome and regional LAI estimations.

A total of 72 regions were obtained after removing chromosome ends that were shorter than 5 Mb. Either the whole-genome LTR-RT library or the regional LTR-RT library (generated based on intact LTR-RTs in that region) were used to annotate total LTR-RTs in each region.

Intact LTR-RTs are identified by LTR_retriever (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which recognizes a number of sequence features such as the complete long terminal repeat (LTR), di-nucleotide termini flanking the LTR region (usually 5&#x02032;-TG..CA-3&#x02032;), 4&#x02013;6 bp target site duplication flanking the element, and alignment of protein sequences in the internal region. For the estimation of the denominator (total LTR-RT length), the non-redundant LTR-RT library (exemplars) generated by LTR_retriever was used to search the genome by the homology-based RepeatMasker program, then the length of all annotated sequences in the genome was summed up as the denominator. In cases where the degradation of LTR retrotransposons left unrecognizable sequence fragments, this estimation may be difficult to ascertain. To identify all LTR sequences in the genome, we progressively increased the divergence threshold in homology searches using RepeatMasker. The raw LAI score stabilized when sequence divergence increased to 40% in LTR-RT annotations of both rice and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Thus, the divergence rate of 40% is used for the estimation of total LTR-RT content in this study.</p><p>The content of LTR-RTs in a genome is a complex interplay between LTR-RT amplification and removal, which could be very different among species. Since young elements are more likely to remain intact, it is conceivable that raw LAI is influenced by the dynamics of LTR-RTs. For example, if a species has recent LTR-RT amplification, then more intact LTR-RT is present in the genome, resulting in an increase of raw LAI. In contrast, if there is little LTR-RT amplification, or a large quantity of intact LTR-RTs has been eliminated from the genome, the raw LAI of the genome would be very low due to the dearth of intact LTR-RTs. To quantify the outcome of LTR-RT dynamics, one possible way is to estimate the mean age of intact LTR-RTs in a genome. However, intact LTR-RTs are usually young and highly identical to each other and are often the poorest assembled component in genomes. Thus, assembly of intact LTR-RT is biased to older elements with higher diversity and their mean age is prone to be overestimated in draft genomes. On the other hand, the presence of LTR regions in a genome also reflects the amplification and removal of LTR-RTs, which could be measured by the identity of LTR regions in each LTR family. Because of the shorter length and higher diversity, assembly of LTR regions is relatively robust to genome quality. Moreover, the identity of LTR regions in a family is a more comprehensive indicator for amplification because it collects information from both intact elements and solo LTRs. Thus, we used the LTR identity to represent the dynamics of LTR-RTs, which is estimated using all-versus-all BLAST among all LTR regions in a genome (see Materials and Methods for details).</p><p>To test the relationship between raw LAI and the dynamics of LTR-RTs, we selected 20 plant genomes that were sequenced using long-read sequencing techniques and possess high quality as revealed by other genome metrics such as contig N50, BUSCO completeness, and CEGMA completeness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Materials and Methods</xref>).

We thus adjusted the raw LAI based on this relationship (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and the adjusted LAI becomes independent with the amplification time of LTR-RTs that is represented by the mean insertion time of individual intact LTR-RTs (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.59) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).

Intact LTR-RTs serve as a sensitive indicator due to the difficulties in resolving its complete structure. It would be optimal if all intact LTR-RTs of a genome are known, so that the genome quality could be evaluated by the percentage of fully assembled LTR-RTs. However, measuring the exact amount of intact LTR-RT is impossible until the assembly reaches its perfection, which is the dilemma of evaluating genome quality solely based on intact LTR-RTs. Without knowing the content of intact LTR-RTs, one possible way is to control for the factors that alternate the level of intact LTR-RTs between genomes, such as the total LTR-RT content (including intact and fragmented LTR-RTs) and the activity of LTR-RTs (including the amplification and removal of LTR-RTs). After reconciling the radical differences of these two factors between genomes, we developed LAI for interspecific comparisons of assembly continuity.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that LAI is a universal metric that is robust to genome size (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>) for the evaluation of repetitive and intergenic sequence space. It is worth noting that the calculation of LAI relies on the identification of intact LTR-RTs to estimate the total LTR-RT content. After adjustment, although LAI is insensitive to LTR-RT content (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and LTR-RT dynamics (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>) in general, for genomes with limited LTR sequence (intact LTR-RT &#x0003c; 0.1%, total LTR-RT &#x0003c; 5%), the number of detectable intact elements would be insufficient to cover all LTR-RT related sequences for accurate estimation. This is the case for many non-plant species such as human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, intact LTR-RT 0.02%), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>, total LTR-RT 3.3% (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)), and nematode (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, total LTR-RT 0.4% (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)). For the identification of intact LTR-RT, many existing methods are available, such as LTR_STRUC (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), LTR_FINDER (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), LTRharvest (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and LTR_retriever (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, based on our previous study, only LTR_retriever possesses a low level of false discovery rate and effectively eliminates misassembled LTR elements (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Even the reference genomes of rice and Arabidopsis sequenced using the BAC-by-BAC approach and regarded as the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for eukaryotic genomics, their genome assemblies still contain many gaps, misassemblies, and missing significant amounts of sequences which are mainly comprised of rDNA and centromeric sequences (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).

Benefiting from the long-read-length nature, long-read techniques are able to span larger regions that are enriched with nested transposon insertions and highly identical repeats, including some of the relatively short centromeric regions (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), which yields higher LAI scores comparing to those of reference genomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, many centromeres and rDNA arrays span several Mb and have near 100% identity in these genomes, which are still unresolved even using the &#x02018;state-of-the-art&#x02019; long-read techniques and remain the major challenge for eukaryotic genomics (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>For comparison between assemblies of the same species, it is recommended to use the raw LAI score because LTR-RT dynamics is comparable within species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Furthermore, raw LAI is computationally more efficient than LAI, because the former does not require the calculation of the genome-wide LTR identity. Thus, raw LAI could be helpful for users to quickly select a high-quality genome with multiple available versions or for genome researchers to iteratively improve the genome assembly by selecting assemblers and parameters that yield the highest raw LAI. After adjusting for LTR dynamics using LTR identity of the genome, the LAI becomes robust for interspecific comparison (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>). For example, we identified the long-read-based <italic>Utricularia gibba</italic> genome, the smallest flowering plant genome being sequenced so far (101 Mb) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), has high-quality gene space and contiguity given the CEGMA completeness of 0.98 and contig N50 of 3.4 Mb. However, the <italic>U. gibba</italic> genome has extraordinary low LAI score (raw LAI = 4.8) due to very limited retrotransposition activities in the past few million years (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). After adjusting for LTR dynamics, the LAI score recovers to 14.4, which agrees with the completeness of gene space and overall high quality, indicating that the adjustment is effective.</p><p>Our data indicate that the BAC-by-BAC approach still serves as the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for genome sequencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, due to its high cost, it is unrealistic for the BAC-based technique to dominate whole-genome sequencing in future. Alternatively, a small number of fully sequenced BACs can be used to quantify sequencing and assembly errors in a genome generated by other techniques. Different from this approach, the LAI program studies the sequence contiguity purely based on the genome assembly itself without further input, which could significantly ease the evaluation procedure and provide a generic result for readers and genomic researchers about the continuity of the focal genome assembly. Theoretically, LAI score could range from 0 to 100. However, by comparing to sequences generated through the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; BAC-by-BAC approach, LAI score of greater than or equal to 20 indicates high quality. In this regard, we further propose a genome classification system for the assembly of repetitive and intergenic sequence space using LAI: draft quality, with LAI score less than 10; reference quality, with LAI score ranges from 10 to 20; and gold quality, with LAI score greater than 20 (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Classification of repetitive sequence assemblies using the LTR Assembly Index (LAI)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Category</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LAI</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Draft</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 &#x02264; LAI &#x0003c; 10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Apple (v1.0), Cacao (v1.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 &#x02264; LAI &#x0003c; 20</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arabidopsis (TAIR10), Grape (12X)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gold</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 &#x02264; LAI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rice (MSUv7), Maize (B73 v4)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Among the genomes we have analyzed, the sorghum genome receives the highest LAI score (LAI &#x0003e; 29) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which is somewhat surprising. However, scaffold N50 and contig N50 of the sorghum genome is among the highest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">H</xref>), which could be attributed to the use of Sanger sequencing followed by manual curation (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Besides, the assembly of the sorghum genome was facilitated by a physical map, which has been shown very powerful for construction of a continuous assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In regard to the internal region size of LTR elements, the sorghum genome is one of the largest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). Longer internal regions would lead to an increased size of intact elements, resulting in an increased LAI value. Nevertheless, it is clear that long internal region does not guarantee a high LAI score in that the LAI of the <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> genome is only 7.7, which is consistent with its short contig N50 (68 Kb). It is conceivable that when the contig is short, long LTR elements are less likely to be assembled, resulting in low LAI. Together, the high LAI value of the sorghum genome is due to both its high quality and long internal regions of LTR elements.</p><p>Using LAI, genome researchers can now evaluate the quality of their genome assembly, compare assembly quality between different versions, select for the best-performed assembler, and acquire a perception of the quality of their genomes by comparing to other species. This is the first time the continuity of intergenic and repetitive sequence assembly can be quantified and compared across species. With the fast development of sequencing techniques and assemble algorithms, genome sequencing itself is shifting from being the major focus of a study to serving as the foundation to answer more biological questions that cover a broad, if not all, fields of biological research. In this regard, LAI is a basic yet important quality check for genome assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Scripts and user's guide for computing LAI scores were included in the latest release of the open source package LTR_retriever in GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever">https://github.com/oushujun/LTR_retriever</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky730_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Robert VanBuren for valuable discussions.
