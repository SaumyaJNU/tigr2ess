This study was conducted to determine the effects of continuous (repeated seasonal) applications of biochar on nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in rice. A fixed field experiment was done in Yongan Town, Hunan Province, China, in six continuous seasons (the early and late rice-growing seasons from 2015 to 2017). Results showed that biochar application did not significantly affect soil N uptake in the first four seasons. The effect of biochar application on fertilizer N uptake was not significant in three of the first four seasons. In the fifth and sixth seasons, biochar application resulted in 14&#x02013;26% increases in soil N uptake but 19&#x02013;26% decreases in fertilizer N uptake. Soil N availability did not explain the increased soil N uptake with biochar application. The decreased fertilizer N uptake with biochar application was attributed to both decreased fertilizer N availability and increased N loss through ammonia volatilization. As a consequence of a compensation between the increased soil N uptake and the decreased fertilizer N uptake, the effect of biochar application on total N uptake was not significant in the fifth and sixth seasons. However, biochar application led to 7&#x02013;11% increases in internal N use efficiency in the fifth and sixth seasons and 6% increase in grain yield in the sixth season. Our study suggests that the effects of repeated seasonal applications of biochar on N uptake and utilization in rice depend on the duration of biochar application. Longer continuous applications of biochar can increase internal N use efficiency and grain yield in rice with insignificant change in total N uptake.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world&#x02019;s population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

To enhance rice yield with fewer chemical fertilizer inputs, improvement in soil quality is critical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. An important step towards improving soil quality is to facilitate recycling of organic fertilizers including crop residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Biochar is a carbon-rich solid material produced by pyrolyzing biomass (e.g. crop residues) in an oxygen-limited environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Biochar application to soils is considered a means of abating climate change by sequestering carbon (C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, because biochar application has the potential to stimulate crop growth by improving soil quality including enhancing water storage, improving nutrient supply, increasing beneficial microbial activity, and suppressing soil-borne disease, it has been postulated that biochar could be a beneficial soil amendment for crop production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nitrogen (N) is usually the most yield-limiting nutrient in rice production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Because biochar contains some N, its application could increase total N content in the soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, there have been reports that biochar application may decrease N availability by its direct adsorption effect and/or indirect microbial immobilization effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the other hand, N uptake, especially fertilizer N uptake, in rice plants is largely influenced by the magnitude of N loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It has been documented that biochar application can reduce nitrous oxide emission and N leaching from rice fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, because biochar is typically alkaline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, its application can increase soil pH and may subsequently increase ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) volatilization from rice soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These facts indicate that biochar application may lead to changes in N uptake and utilization in rice. This was confirmed in previous studies of other crops such as wheat and maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and also in a one-season rice pot experiment by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, who observed that biochar application increased fertilizer N uptake in rice. However, it is still not clear how N uptake and utilization in rice will change in response to continuous applications of biochar under field conditions. Such information would be useful in guiding the use of biochar in rice production.</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, N uptake, internal N use efficiency, and grain yield were compared between rice grown with and without biochar application in a field experiment carried out in six continuous seasons.

Fertilizer N uptake was not significantly affected by biochar application in three of the first four seasons. In the fifth and sixth seasons, biochar application significantly increased soil N uptake, but the effect of biochar application on total N uptake was not significant because it was compensated for by significantly decreased fertilizer N uptake.

In this study, biochar application significantly increased soil total N content at the end of the experiment. The increase in soil total N content with biochar application was partly due to the biochar containing a certain amount of N. Moreover, the <sup>15</sup>N tracing micro-plot experiment indicates that increased fertilizer N retention (soil <sup>15</sup>N abundance) in the soil was also partially responsible for the increased soil total N content induced by biochar application.

Furthermore, in this study, the increase in soil total N content with application of biochar did not result in increased soil available N content. This was partly because the N contained in biochar existed in organic forms and most fertilizer N retained in the soil was converted to organic forms, neither of which were readily available for plant uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. On the other hand, soil enzymes are known to be involved in nutrient cycling, and as such, their activities can be used as potential indicators of nutrient cycling processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

Therefore, in this study, the insignificant effect of biochar application on soil available N content was also attributed to a trade-off between increased soil total N content and decreased soil invertase activity. These facts indicate that soil N availability was not responsible for the significantly positive effect of longer continuous applications of biochar on soil N uptake. Therefore, the increased soil N uptake with longer continuous applications of biochar application should be attributed to improved root traits. In this regard, it has been well documented that biochar application benefits root morphological development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

This increased NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization was attributed to an increase in soil pH, which is generally positively correlated with NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Similar results have also been reported in short-term experiments in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These facts indicate that the significantly negative effect of longer continuous applications of biochar on fertilizer N uptake in this study was attributed to both decreased fertilizer N availability and increased fertilizer N loss.</p><p id="Par17">Biochar application had a significantly positive effect on internal N use efficiency in the fifth and sixth seasons. In general, internal N use efficiency increases with decreasing total N uptake in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, in this study, the significantly positive effect of biochar application on internal N use efficiency was achieved with unchanged total N uptake in the sixth season. As a consequence, grain yield was significantly increased by biochar application in this season. These results indicate that higher grain yield can be obtained after longer continuous applications of biochar by increasing internal N use efficiency. There is evidence that increasing harvest index is one possible way to achieve high internal N use efficiency in rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, this was not the case in the present study because harvest index was significantly decreased with biochar application (data not shown). In another approach, the internal N use efficiency can be increased by increasing photosynthetic N use efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Consistently, we observed that biochar addition resulted in significantly higher radiation use efficiency during the post-heading period in rice plants in another study (data not shown). These facts highlight the need for a fundamental understanding of the effects of biochar application on physiological processes governing internal N use efficiency in rice.</p><p id="Par18">Reducing N rate from 150 to 90&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> resulted in reduction in grain yield in all six seasons. The reduced grain yield was mainly attributed to decreased total N uptake, which was caused by both decreased fertilizer N uptake and decreased soil available N content. The result of this study is not consistent with that reported by Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, who observed that grain yield was not significantly affected by reducing N rate from 150 to 90&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in a single-season rice system. This difference in response of grain yield to reducing N was due to the different proportions of fertilizer N uptake in total N uptake. In this study, fertilizer N uptake accounted for 46% of total N uptake across six seasons (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), while it accounted for only 18% in Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, the results of this study also suggest that biochar application may not reduce the dependence on N fertilizer in rice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par19">The effects of continuous applications of biochar on N uptake and utilization in rice depend on the duration of biochar application. Longer (six-season) continuous applications of biochar are able to improve grain yield in rice by increasing internal N use efficiency with unchanged total N uptake. However, the dependence on N fertilizer in rice may not be reduced by biochar application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Site and soil</title><p id="Par20">A fixed field experiment was conducted in Yongan Town (28&#x000b0;09&#x02032;N, 113&#x000b0;37&#x02032;E, 43&#x02009;m asl), Hunan Province, China, in the early and late rice-growing seasons from 2015 to 2017.
