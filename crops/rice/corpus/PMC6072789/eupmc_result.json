    "Herbicides are important constituents of modern integrated weed management system. However, the continuous use of a single herbicide leads to the frequent evolution of resistant weeds which further challenges their management. To overcome this situation, alternating use of multiple herbicides along with conventional weed-management practices is suitable and recommended. The development of multiple herbicide-tolerant crops is still in its infancy, and only a few crops with herbicide tolerance traits have been reported and commercialized. In this study, we developed transgenic rice plants that were tolerant to both bensulfuron methyl (BM) and glufosinate herbicides. The herbicide tolerant mutant variant of rice AHAS (Acetohydroxyacid synthase) was overexpressed along with codon optimized bacterial bar gene. The developed transgenic lines showed significant tolerance to both herbicides at various stages of plant development. The selected transgenic lines displayed an increased tolerance against 100 μM BM and 30 mg/L phosphinothricin during seed germination stage. Foliar applications further confirmed the dual tolerance to 300 μM BM and 2% basta herbicides without any significant growth and yield penalties. The development of dual-herbicide-tolerant transgenic plants adds further information to the knowledge of crop herbicide tolerance for sustainable weed management in modern agricultural system."
