However, the continuous use of a single herbicide leads to the frequent evolution of resistant weeds which further challenges their management. To overcome this situation, alternating use of multiple herbicides along with conventional weed-management practices is suitable and recommended. The development of multiple herbicide-tolerant crops is still in its infancy, and only a few crops with herbicide tolerance traits have been reported and commercialized. In this study, we developed transgenic rice plants that were tolerant to both bensulfuron methyl (BM) and glufosinate herbicides. The herbicide tolerant mutant variant of rice <italic>AHAS</italic> (<italic>Acetohydroxyacid synthase</italic>) was overexpressed along with codon optimized bacterial <italic>bar</italic> gene. The developed transgenic lines showed significant tolerance to both herbicides at various stages of plant development. The selected transgenic lines displayed an increased tolerance against 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;M BM and 30&#x02009;mg/L phosphinothricin during seed germination stage. Foliar applications further confirmed the dual tolerance to 300&#x02009;&#x003bc;M BM and 2% basta herbicides without any significant growth and yield penalties. The development of dual-herbicide-tolerant transgenic plants adds further information to the knowledge of crop herbicide tolerance for sustainable weed management in modern agricultural system.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001503</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Agricultural Science Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>M.

Their infestation imposes a severe challenge to crop yield, productivity and survival of plants. Among various conventional and modern strategies, chemical herbicides are the least expensive, easiest and most effective way to combat weed invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Advancements in genetically modified herbicide resistance technology, which began with the introduction of the first glyphosate-resistant soybean variety in 1996, opened a new way to manage weed populations in crop fields. Since then, many important genetically modified crops that are tolerant to various herbicides have been developed and commercialized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Most of the transgenic crops are transformed with single herbicide-tolerance genes against glyphosate, basta, HPPD, PPO or AHAS-inhibiting herbicides. With the rise in global demand for food and other agricultural products, herbicide technology has contributed greatly during the past few decades. However, the continuous overuse of a single herbicide multiple times in a growing season increases the potential risk of evolution of resistant weeds which has become a major concern in agriculture worldwide. Further, higher doses of herbicide applications cause major threats to agricultural land and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Many weeds which are resistant to various herbicides have been identified in different parts of the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. According to the &#x02018;International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds&#x02019;, 486 unique cases of herbicide-resistant weed biotypes have been reported globally, of which 147 are in dicot and 106 are in monocot groups. A total of 92 crops have been reported to be infested by herbicide-resistant weeds. Glyphosate, basta, AHAS inhibitor, HPPD inhibitor and PPO inhibitor herbicides are widely used to kill or suppress weeds in crop fields. Among these herbicides, the highest 159 identified unique cases of weed resistance were of AHAS-inhibiting herbicides; in addition, there have been 39 cases of resistance identified against glyphosate, 3 against basta, 2 against HPPD-inhibitors and 13 against PPO-inhibiting herbicides, and the number is increasing daily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To counter the problem of the evolution of resistant weeds and to minimize the overuse of herbicides, alternative agricultural strategies including the use of multiple herbicides in conjunction with traditional methods are suggested which constitutes an effective integrated weed management practice. Moreover, it is extremely important to maintain the diversity in herbicide use for efficiently exploiting the properties of important presently available herbicides to manage the weeds proficiently for the long term. The development of transgenic crops that are resistant to two or more herbicides remains a major challenge and a priority area of agricultural programs. However, the agribiotech or agrichemical companies like Monsanto, Pioneer, Dow, Bayer and Syngenta have proposed or it is in their agenda to introduce multiple herbicide tolerant traits in crops particularly in soybean in addition to glyphosate tolerance trait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, realizing its importance in food security, we report the development of dual-herbicide tolerant transgenic rice plants that exhibit tolerance to basta and BM for sustainable weed management.</p><p id="Par4">AHAS is the first enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway and is the target of many commercially used herbicides including sulfonyl ureas and other related derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The AHAS enzyme catalyzes the formation of acetolactate from two molecules of pyruvate which is a precursor for the synthesis of the amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Many commercially important AHAS inhibitors such as sulfonylureas (SUs), imidazolinones (IMIs), triazolopyrimidines (TPs), pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates (POBs), and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones (SCTs) are marketed and used for pre-emergent or post-emergent applications. The mutant variants of AHAS can tolerate applications of different kinds of herbicides and has been used in many commercially important transgenic crops. Apart from generating transgenic crops tolerant to various AHAS-inhibitor herbicides, scientists have also been able to develop the same with the help of conventional breeding methods which are referred as non-transgenic crops. The development of Clearfield* crops with the help of conventional breeding is the best example of commercially available non-transgenic crops. These crops are tolerant to various kinds of imidazolinone herbicides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Recently, Shobha and colleagues have developed and characterized a novel imidazolinone tolerant mutant in indica rice with the help of EMS technique. These plants were able to tolerate increased application of Imazethapyr herbicide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Piao and colleagues have also developed an imidazolinone resistant japonica rice variety by introducing a resistant form of <italic>AHAS</italic> from indica variety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, there are many reports exploiting the use of different AHAS mutations to develop AHAS-inhibitor tolerant rice and other crops (briefly described in discussion part).</p><p id="Par5">Among the various herbicide tolerant mutations reported in AHAS, the position P197 (with respect to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) is highly vulnerable to amino acid substitutions resulting in tolerance against sulfonylurea herbicides. A total of 11 different amino acid substitutions are reported at this position in many tolerant weed biotypes that show a high degree of resistance against several AHAS-inhibiting herbicides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Similarly, bialaphos is an important non-selective broad-spectrum herbicide that selectively inhibits glutamine synthetase (GS), a key enzyme in the nitrogen assimilation pathway. The <italic>Bar</italic> (Bialaphos resistance) encoding gene detoxifies bialaphos (becomes active after the removal of 2 alanine residues, which is then called phosphinothricin) via the acetylation of its amino group. Many commercially important bialaphos-resistant crops such as canola, corn, cotton and soybean have been developed by introducing <italic>bar</italic> genes from <italic>Streptomyces</italic>; these transgenic crops are successfully cultivated in many parts of the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The hybridization of nylon membrane with <italic>AHAS</italic> DIG labelled probe resulted in a common band for all the transgenic lines (including wild type (<italic>wt</italic>) control plant) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>); this band represents the native <italic>AHAS</italic> gene. In addition to native copy, there was an additional band found for all 5 transgenic lines (line 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), which showed the single copy <italic>AHAS</italic> transgene integration. Subsequently, the same nylon membrane was re-hybridized with <italic>bar</italic> DIG probe. The <italic>bar</italic> probe resulted in the same pattern as observed in <italic>AHAS</italic> hybridization except the common <italic>AHAS</italic> band due to the heterologous origin of <italic>bar</italic> gene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Among the transgenic plants (lines 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6), lines 4 and 6 showed similar band patterns for both the <italic>AHAS</italic> and <italic>bar</italic> genes; thus considered as the same transgenic events. Further, transgenic line 3 and the <italic>wt</italic> control did not show signals for any of the genes; this line was considered non-transgenic.

Northern hybridization was performed consecutively with <italic>AHAS</italic> and <italic>bar</italic> DIG probes. Initially, the membrane was hybridized with <italic>AHAS</italic> DIG probe which resulted in an ~2&#x02009;kb band for all the plant samples; however, the hybridization signal was found to be higher in all the transgenic lines compared to the <italic>wt</italic> controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Furthermore, the membrane was reprobed with <italic>bar</italic> DIG probe which resulted in an ~500&#x02009;bp hybridization signal for all transgenic lines; this band was absent in the <italic>wt</italic> control.

Similarly, the semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiment showed a higher expression (almost 2-fold) of the <italic>AHAS</italic> gene in the transgenic lines compared to the <italic>wt</italic> control plants due to the active transcription of the <italic>AHAS</italic> transgene copy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). All four transgenic lines showed expression of the <italic>bar</italic> gene in semi quantitative RT-PCR which was absent in <italic>wt</italic> control plants.
