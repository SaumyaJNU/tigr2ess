    "The plant hormone ethylene was identified as important triggering factor and primary regulator of flower senescence in many species. Consequently, application of chemical inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action is used to extend the longevity of ethylene-sensitive flowers. Here, we show that the peptide NOP-1, a biological derived from the nuclear localization signal of ethylene regulator EIN2 tightly binds to the ethylene receptor of carnation plants - a model to study flower senescence. When applied on cut flowers the peptide biological delays petal senescence similar to previously identified and currently used chemical inhibitors, but offers significant advances to these chemicals in biodegradability, sustainability and ecotoxicity. Our bioinformatic analysis of a wide range of ethylene receptors indicates complete sequence conservation of the anticipated NOP-1 binding site in flower species supporting a widespread use of the peptide on flowering ornamentals to delay senescence and decay in cut flowers. We anticipate our innovative approach to extend flower longevity by a new class of biomolecules such as peptides, peptide analogues and peptide mimetics will significantly advance our technological capability to delay flower senescence and expand vase-life of cut flowers in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner."
