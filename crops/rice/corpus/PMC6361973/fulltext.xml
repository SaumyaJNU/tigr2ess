Consequently, application of chemical inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action is used to extend the longevity of ethylene-sensitive flowers. Here, we show that the peptide NOP-1, a biological derived from the nuclear localization signal of ethylene regulator EIN2 tightly binds to the ethylene receptor of carnation plants - a model to study flower senescence. When applied on cut flowers the peptide biological delays petal senescence similar to previously identified and currently used chemical inhibitors, but offers significant advances to these chemicals in biodegradability, sustainability and ecotoxicity. Our bioinformatic analysis of a wide range of ethylene receptors indicates complete sequence conservation of the anticipated NOP-1 binding site in flower species supporting a widespread use of the peptide on flowering ornamentals to delay senescence and decay in cut flowers. We anticipate our innovative approach to extend flower longevity by a new class of biomolecules such as peptides, peptide analogues and peptide mimetics will significantly advance our technological capability to delay flower senescence and expand vase-life of cut flowers in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was supported in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, CRC 1208, project B06 (G.G.).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Flower senescence is a tightly regulated developmental process that plays a crucial role in the overall reproductive strategy of many plants. Initial work on this developmental process was motivated primarily by the commercial interest in increasing the life time of cut flowers which according to import statistics reported to United Nations (UN) show an overall world trade value of around 4 billion USD. Europe (66.7%), the US (19.3%) and Japan (10.7%) form the three most important floriculture consumption regions in this market. Globally, both, traders and customers, demand for cut flowers with a long vase-life no matter whether those have already experienced long-distance transport from their cultivation areas in Latin America or Eastern Africa. Accordingly, chemicals or processes that decelerate or delay flower senescence are of broad social and economic interest.</p><p id="Par3">Identification of the plant hormone ethylene as primary regulator of carnation senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and the drastic extension of life of petals after treatment of cut flowers by inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> or ethylene action inhibitors resulted in a range of commercial treatments to extend the vase life of cut flowers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Small molecule inhibitors amino-ethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) and amino-oxyacetic acid (AOA) which interfere with ethylene biosynthesis have been shown effective in blocking ethylene production that accompanies senescence. Consequently, a number of commercial products based on these chemicals have been introduced to the market to delay floral senescence and abscission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, these inhibitors are ineffective in preventing the effects of exogenous ethylene on flower senescence during transport and storage. Hence, more commercial interest was received for inhibitors blocking ethylene perception such as silver ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and the cyclopropene derivative 1-MCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Silver salts which were shown to decrease the number of active ethylene binding sites and alter signal output of the receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> have been an industry standard for preventing ethylene action in ornamentals for decades. But nowadays the use of the heavy metal pollutant is banned in many countries due to serious concerns about its potential as a groundwater pollutant. In recent years, the cyclic olefine 1-MCP has been widely adopted in the ornamental plant industry as a non-toxic alternative to silver salts, although it does not control senescence for as long as silver ions when applied in a single treatment. However, repetitive treatments with the gaseous inhibitor resulted in a marked increase in vase life and efficiently blocked floral senescence of cut flower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Hence, 1-MCP today is widely used as ethylene action inhibitor at a wide range of ornamental plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> which due to the gaseous character of the inhibitor are treated in enclosed, gas-tight areas. The inhibitor was shown to be highly efficient at very small concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, although treatment depends on temperature achieving complete inhibition at 20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, but almost no inhibition at 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to chemical treatments, transgenic approaches targeting ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene signaling were applied to extend flower vase life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Overall, each method comes with its own chances and drawbacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Hence, a sustainable and easy-to-use method to improve longevity of cut flower has not been found yet.</p><p id="Par4">The different strategies developed in the past to delay floral senescence have been used on a wide range of ornamental plants. However, among ethylene-sensitive flowers carnations are probably the most studied model system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> as they are highly sensitive and rapidly respond to the plant hormone by clear physiological and morphological changes which can be studied even on individual petals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Much of the current knowledge on ethylene perception and transduction has been established by physiological, biochemical and genetic studies in the small crucifer weed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and crops such as tomato or rice. These studies clarified that ethylene is perceived by a family of receptor proteins (ETRs), which form homo- and heterodimers at the ER membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although the exact output of the receptors is still obscure, genetic and biochemical studies established that in the absence of ethylene, a receptor associated kinase (CTR1) phosphorylates a central regulator of the signaling cascade (EIN2). Conversely, in the presence of ethylene the CTR1 kinase is inactivated leading to dephosphorylation of EIN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In turn, the EIN2 C-terminal domain (aa 462&#x02013;1294) containing a highly conserved nuclear localization signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, is processed by a so far unknown protease and translocated to the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> where it activates a variety of ethylene response genes and phenotypes. Recent studies in our lab propose an efficient way to interfere with ethylene signaling based on a yet unknown function of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in EIN2. Peptides mimicking this NLS motif were shown to affect ethylene responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and also function as potent inhibitor of tomato fruit ripening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">To clarify whether NOP-1 also has the potential to serve as an inhibitor of senescence in cut flowers, we applied the peptide on cut carnations (<italic>Dianthus caryophyllus</italic>) and analyzed the effect on floral senescence in this model ethylene response system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In analogy to treatment with the chemical senescence inhibitor STS containing silver ions as active ingredient which target plant ethylene receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> the peptide was directly supplied to the vase water. Senescence was monitored visually throughout the experiment and quantified by changes observed in petal size and/or color (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). While controls with no additions to vase water show a clear senescence phenotype of petal inrolling and petal fading after 6 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, upper panel), the addition of 1&#x02009;mM silver salt delays the appearance of these morphological manifestations by several days and petals show almost no signs of senescence after 15 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, middle panel). Similarly, addition of NOP-1 peptide at 0.5&#x02009;mM concentration clearly delays the onset of petal senescence and significantly increases flower longevity, although the delay is shorter than observed with the potent silver salt inhibitor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, lower panel). To further substantiate the effect of the peptide biological on floral senescence observed with the carnation model system, we used roses as another species of highly ethylene sensitive ornamental plants. Similar to carnations untreated roses showed obvious signs of senescence such as wilting and petal bending by day 6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, upper panel). The untreated controls completely ended their vase life on day 9 due to these morphological changes. In contrast, cut roses treated with the silver salt inhibitor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, middle panel) and flowers treated with the NOP-1 peptide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, lower panel) showed a prolonged vase life of about 6&#x02013;8 days relative to buffer controls. While the silver salt chemical inhibitor was noticeably more efficient in extending the vase life of cut carnations than the peptide biological (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), the difference on flower longevity between both treatments is less pronounced for cut roses (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Nevertheless, on the entire trial period, NOP-1 was less effective than the silver treatment similar to what is seen for carnation. Noteworthy, no beneficial effect on flower longevity was observed by multiple treatments with the NOP-1 peptide in contrast to studies with the gaseous ethylene antagonist 1-MCP which significantly delayed flower senescence when applied on a daily basis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Hence, further testing remains to be done to uncover the full potential of the peptide biological in order to identify optimum treatment conditions (concentration, duration, temperature) and strategies for efficient application.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of small molecule inhibitors of ethylene signaling on flower senescence of cut carnations.

To this end, DcETR1 was cloned in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, expressed and purified according to protocols established in our lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> for ethylene receptors from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, tomato and apple (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Functional folding of the recombinant purified proteins was demonstrated by CD spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) and purified DcETR1 was labeled with fluorescent dye AlexaFluor488. To determine binding affinity and dissociation constants of the purified recombinant proteins and the NOP-1 peptide we used microscale thermophoresis. In these experiments we observed tight binding of the DcETR1 receptor to the EIN2 ethylene central regulator (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, K<sub>D</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;135.9&#x02009;nM&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.35&#x02009;nM) as previously observed for the interaction of the corresponding proteins from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. These data indicate a high affinity and central protein protein interaction (PPI) common in ethylene signaling among plant species. Consequently, targeting this interaction by small-molecule modulators has the potential to shut down ethylene signaling and related plant responses. Therefore, we tested binding of the ripening delaying peptide NOP-1 identified in previous studies to target the ETR1-EIN2 complex with our purified carnation receptor DcETR1. Our data on the carnation protein confirm binding of the peptide biological at similar affinities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, K<sub>D</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.49&#x02009;&#x000b5;M&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.55&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) as earlier observed for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and tomato receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The precise interaction site of NOP-1 at the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ETR1 receptor was recently resolved in our lab by molecular and computational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In these studies, we uncovered binding of the peptide biological at the GAF domain of the receptor. Based on the resolved binding site and binding mode we proposed that the bound peptide arrests intra- and intermolecular downstream signaling in the receptor resulting in the observed ripening inhibition. To verify that the NOP-1 binding site identified in the <italic>Arabidopspis</italic> ETR1 receptor is also present in ethylene receptors of cut flowers and ornamental plants, we compared the corresponding sequence (aa 143&#x02013;174 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) in 17 flowering ornamentals widely used as cut flowers. Remarkably, all tested varieties show an identical protein sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The extreme conservation found in this part of the receptor (see also Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) further emphasizes a potential critical role of this element in downstream signal transfer. Moreover, the exact match of this patch in the receptors of different flower species supports a general usage of NOP-1 as a senescence inhibitor in a variety of cut flowers without the need to genetically engineer ornamental plants in ethylene biosynthesis or perception.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Molecular binding studies of carnation ethylene receptor DcETR1.

In contrast, silver salts although they offer long lasting senescence protection have various drawbacks. As a heavy metal they are highly toxic and harmful to the environment, persist in soil and groundwater for long periods and pollute drinking water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. 1-MCP, another senescence inhibitor used to extend longevity of cut flowers, lacks most of these disadvantages, is easy to dispose and safe, but as a gas is active by fumigation only complicating its usage on cut flowers. Hence, the peptide biological NOP-1 combines the strengths of current senescence inhibitors and thereby offers an alternative and sustainable approach to prolong the vase-life of cut flowers. To further improve the effect on the vase-life of cut flowers, additional studies on more flower species and variants of the NOP-1 biological (peptide length, stability, modifications) are needed. Nevertheless, our present work highlights a novel way to address flower longevity and presents future opportunities to control senescence delay in cut flowers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment of cut flowers with NOP-1 peptide</title><p id="Par10">Cut flowers of carnations (<italic>Dianthus caryophyllus</italic>) and rose (<italic>Rosa hybrida</italic>), graded for marketable quality, were obtained from a local flower producer.

For linearized vector amplification oligonucleotides 5&#x02032;-GGATCCGGCTGCTAACAAAGC-3&#x02032; as forward primer and 5&#x02032;-ATGACGACCTTCGATATGGC-3&#x02032; as reverse primer were used. The target gene was amplified using 5&#x02032;-ATCGAAGGTCGTCATATGGAGAGCTGCAACTGCATC-3&#x02032; as forward primer and 5&#x02032;-TTAGCAGCCGGATCCTTACTTCGGCATCGGCTCAAA-3&#x02032; as reverse primer. Fragments were fused to the final circular expression vector by adding Gibson Assembly Master Mix including an exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a ligase. The sample was incubated at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min and at 40&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 60&#x02009;min.
