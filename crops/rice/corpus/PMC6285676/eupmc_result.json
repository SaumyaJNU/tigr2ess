    "Background:Population growth has led to the need to increase global food production. Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect pests. About 20-30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans, domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment. Objectives:The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their usage. Methods:The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh; Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions, direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014. Results:Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM) practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management, information through television, more contact with extension personnel and farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers' understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize environmental hazards. Conclusions:The present study identified a need to intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered bio-diversity of Bangladesh. Participant Consent:Obtained. Ethical Approval:This study was approved by the PhD Supervisory Committee assigned by the Department of Entomology of Bangladesh Agricultural University. Competing Interests:The authors declare no competing financial interests."
