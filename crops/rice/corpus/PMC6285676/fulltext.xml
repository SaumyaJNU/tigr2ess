Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect pests. About 20&#x02013;30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. While pesticides are effective against pest populations, if used injudiciously, they may pose health hazards to humans, domestic animals, natural enemies of crop pests and other forms of life through unwanted contamination of food, feed, water bodies and the environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives.</title><p>The aim of the present study was to examine farmers' level of knowledge and awareness of environmental pollution due to unsafe use of pesticides for controlling rice pests and to explore ways of reducing their usage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods.</title><p>The research population consisted of 120 rice farmers: 40 farmers randomly selected from each of the three rice growing districts of Bangladesh; Mymensingh, Tangail and Jamalpur. Data was collected through group discussions, direct observations and personal interviews during March 2013 to May 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Results.</title><p>Farmers mainly sought advice on pesticide use from pesticide dealers or retailers and a very few farmers contacted government extension workers for this purpose. Most of the farmers had an understanding of natural enemies of rice pests and that the application of synthetic insecticides in the field can reduce their population. A few farmers followed integrated pest management (IPM) practices with little understanding of the adverse effects of insecticides on the environment and ecosystem. The majority of farmers understood the harmful effects of pesticides on health of human and animals, beneficial species, fish, insect resistance, soil and food. It was also found that education on pest management, information through television, more contact with extension personnel and farmers' awareness of IPM were critical factors for improving rice farmers' understanding of the ecological hazards caused by overuse of pesticides. Most of the farmers suggested that timely removal of weeds, appropriate timing for pesticide application, balanced doses of fertilizers, pest monitoring, correct dose of appropriate pesticides, pest tolerant varieties, increasing technical knowledge and skills and creating social awareness of environmental pollution among farmers were necessary to reduce the quantity of pesticides and minimize environmental hazards.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions.</title><p>The present study identified a need to intensify farmers' awareness and knowledge of integrated pest management and environmental pollution through extension organizations which could help promote sustainable agricultural development and improve the currently endangered bio-diversity of Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant Consent.</title><p>Obtained</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Approval.</title><p>This study was approved by the PhD Supervisory Committee assigned by the Department of Entomology of Bangladesh Agricultural University.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests.</title><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rice farmers</kwd><kwd>pesticides</kwd><kwd>environment</kwd><kwd>ecosystem</kwd><kwd>Bangladesh</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Demand for rice in Bangladesh is rapidly increasing along with an increase of population and rice demand in Bangladesh is currently the highest among developing countries.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In order to increase rice production, farmers are using modern varieties of rice, along with intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, water and other technologies which have changed the ecology and escalated pest proliferation.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Insect pests are yield reducers and have increased many folds over recent decades.

In the past, their indiscriminate use has polluted the environment through harmful accumulation in food, feed, soil, water bodies, and air. A sensible approach to increase crop production with the use of pesticides calls for their judicious use as part of an established IPM program. Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the economic costs of pests, selection of appropriate pesticides, dose and formulation, as well as the effects of pesticides on the environment. Studies have addressed many aspects of pesticide use, from purchase to various stages of their application and use. Safe and effective use of pesticide can help achieve the target of sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural production.</p><p>Growth in global population means that farmers must produce food for an estimated 9.1 billion people expected to inhabit the earth by 2050. To feed this growing population, food production must be scaled up by 70% and this may be achieved through proper utilization of available plant genetic resources by developing high yielding varieties of crops, and improving crop production and protection technologies. Pesticides are an important tool used in efforts to control insect pests. About 20&#x02013;30% of agricultural produce is lost annually due to insect pests, diseases, weeds and rodents. Therefore, judicious use of pesticides plays a major role in plant protection. Pesticides are highly effective, rapid in action, convenient to apply, and are powerful and economical tools in pest management.</p><p>Farmers habitually apply fertilizers and hazardous insecticides in high quantities without assessing the actual field requirements due to inadequate knowledge. This indiscriminate input can accelerate insecticide resistance, pest resurgence, and secondary pest outbreak, leading to environmental contamination, persistent residual toxicity and destruction of beneficial insects.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;11</xref> In the absence of a natural enemy population, the pest population can then multiply and enhance the extent of yield loss.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Despite these drawbacks, synthetic insecticides are still the primary method used to control rice insects.

This study was approved by the PhD supervisory committee assigned by the Department of Entomology of Bangladesh Agricultural University. The survey measured awareness of the effects of pesticides. Forty rice farmers were randomly and purposively selected for the interview from each of the three locations for a total of 120 respondents. Farmers involved in rice cultivation in both the Amon (rain fed) and Boro (irrigated) seasons were selected for the survey and detailed information was obtained concerning farmers' knowledge and attitudes on the usage of pesticides in rice fields and their effects on the environment and ecosystems. The theme of the questions centered on farmers' use of insecticides to control rice pests. The scope of such a survey need not to be limited to farmers' pest management knowledge, attitudes and practices, but could also cover issues such as decision making patterns, agronomic practices and socio-economic profile. Therefore, after administering the initial questionnaire, the interviewer also obtained some information regarding farmers' socioeconomic level. The questionnaire was translated into Bengali and adapted to reflect local situations. First, the interviewer gave farmers a brief introduction to the survey objectives and explained that the survey data would be used for research and solicited their cooperation. The questionnaires were administered separately at all study locations by asking respondents questions one by one in a sequential order. Interviews were recorded. The data sheets were then collected. In most cases, the data collector went to the farmers' rice fields where farmers were working. Data were then compiled and processed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic information and basic characteristics of the farms are outlined in <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1&#x02014;</label><caption><p>Demographic Characteristics of Farmers (n=20)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t01"/></table-wrap><sec><title>Sources of advice for pesticide selection</title><p>Farmers' reported sources of advice on pesticide selection are presented in <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sources of Advice on Pesticide Use for Farmers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t02"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Farmers' knowledge of natural enemies of rice pests</title><p>Out of 120 farmers interviewed, an average of 33.98% farmers reported possessed good knowledge about natural enemies to rice pests, 50.33% reported limited knowledge and 15.66% reported no knowledge about natural enemies (<italic><xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t03" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></italic>). Most of the farmers (59.16%) reported a good understanding of the concept of a group of organisms that are natural enemies to insect pests in rice fields. Many farmers were able to name several natural enemies of rice pests. The most common natural enemies mentioned by farmers were spiders, dragonflies, birds, snakes, frogs, and different types of beetle and flies. Of the farmers who recognized the presence of natural enemies, 35% could describe their role. They had good knowledge of the role of natural enemies and knew that natural enemies feed on other harmful insects and/or their eggs, larvae, nymph or pupae. A total of 89.16% (34.16%+ 55%) of the farmers were aware of the adverse effects of insecticides on natural enemies. This was also evident from the answer to the question of pest resurgence. One fourth of farmers understood that killing of natural enemies could increase pest infestations.

Declining soil fertility reported by the farmers in the present study might be due to a gradual decrease in nutrient replenishment of soils due to destruction of useful microbes.</p></sec><sec><title>Factors influencing farmer's knowledge and perceptions of pesticide usage in Bangladesh</title><p>The factors identified as potential factors enhancing farmers' knowledge levels about pest management strategies in Bangladesh in the present study are in agreement with previous studies that found that farmers' education level, farming experience, training on crop protection, extension contacts and use of IPM methods attributed to the level of awareness and knowledge about pesticides and environment.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;27</xref> Norvell and Hammig reported a positive association between farmers with IPM training and knowledge of farm ecology.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> As shown in <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, data indicate that growers are not motivated to receive information from relevant sources such as the extension personnel of the Department of Agricultural Extension (Bangladesh). Only 7.5% of farmers reported that they got advice and information about pesticide use from extension workers, whereas 69.16% sought advice from pesticide dealers or retail sellers. Pesticide dealers and retailers play a vital role in the use of pesticides in Bangladesh. However, in the present study, 66.66% of farmers reported that contact with extension personnel would help improve their knowledge of proper pesticide usage (<italic><xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t06" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref></italic>). This result (66.66%) is more or less contradictory with the findings presented in <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Only 7.5% farmers contact extension worker as a source of pesticide usage advice while 69.16% of farmers take advice from pesticide dealers or company agents. Pesticide dealers do not have the expertise to provide guidelines to farmers for controlling insect pests effectively by using pesticides. Retailers are motivated to make a profit by selling specific pesticide products rather than being concerned about pesticide efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Alternative methods of reducing pesticides</title><p>Many studies have examined alternative methods of pesticide application. In the present study, farmers reported ten ways of reducing pesticides. Farmers stressed the importance of using balanced doses of fertilizers and this is in agreement with previous studies that have suggested applying organic materials mixed with nitrogen fertilizer to minimize pest prevalence in the rice field.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Pest monitoring and removal of egg mass were also named as alternative ways of reducing pesticides by the farmers. This concept is supported by previous studies which have reported that around 40% of yield loss due to stem borers in rice could be avoided by either removal of egg mass or application of ovicides.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Development and adoption of pest resistant varieties can also reduce farmers' dependence on harmful agrochemicals.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The need to improve farmers' knowledge and practical skills in optimizing the use of pesticides on rice farms through training was also reported by farmers. This is in agreement with earlier findings on this topic.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In addition, the importance of the creation of mass awareness of the adverse effects of agro-chemical products and motivation to increase farmers' adoption of IPM technologies was reported by farmers. Previous studies have supported this assertion.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The utility of integrated rice-fish culture was reported by farmers and numerous studies have reported that integrated rice-fish farming benefits the conservation of rice pest predators, requires smaller amounts of pesticide and fertilizers, promotes preserving a population of natural enemies for biological control of rice pests and ultimately provides a sustainable, economic and ecologically friendly form of pest control.<xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Lastly, previous studies have recommended that effective policy guidelines, pesticide regulation and its effective implementation, motivation of farmers and extension staff, effective environmental technology transfer, promotion of participatory oriented extension programs, awareness building through mass media, expansion of IPM practices, situation analysis and integration of local knowledge could prevent future deterioration of the agro-ecosystem and sustain overall development. <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="i2156-9614-8-20-181203-b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is crucial that farmers gain increased awareness and knowledge of ecological hazards and IPM. Intensive training and practical demonstration under the supervision of extension personnel would help ensure successful reduction of pesticide use in rice cultivation. The results of the present study will assist in improving the action plan of development agencies by disseminating knowledge and technology among farmers to enhance rice production without depleting environmental quality. Further in-depth studies are needed to assess the environmental impacts of rice cultivation and to examine the relationship between IPM awareness and knowledge and their effects on farmers' adoption of environmentally friendly pest management technologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="hapn-8-20-181203_s01.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to the authorities of USDA and BAURES for sponsoring this research and would like to thank the Department of Entomology, Bangladesh Agricultural University for providing all necessary support.
