However, rice husk is reportedly much more recalcitrant than rice straw and produces larger quantities of fermentation inhibitors. The aim of this study was to explore the underlying differences between rice straw and rice husk with reference to the composition of the pre-treatment liquors and their impacts on saccharification and fermentation. This has been carried out by developing quantitative NMR screening methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Air-dried rice husk and rice straw from the same cultivar were used as substrates. Carbohydrate compositions were similar, whereas lignin contents differed significantly (husk: 35.3% w/w of raw material; straw 22.1% w/w of raw material). Substrates were hydrothermally pre-treated with high-pressure microwave processing across a wide range of severities. 25 compounds were identified from the liquors of both pre-treated rice husk and rice straw. However, the quantities of compounds differed between the two substrates. Fermentation inhibitors such as 5-HMF and 2-FA were highest in husk liquors, and formic acid was higher in straw liquors. At a pre-treatment severity of 3.65, twice as much ethanol was produced from rice straw (14.22% dry weight of substrate) compared with the yield from rice husk (7.55% dry weight of substrate). Above severities of 5, fermentation was inhibited in both straw and husk. In addition to inhibitors, high levels of cellulase-inhibiting xylo-oligomers and xylose were found and at much higher concentrations in rice husk liquor. At low severities, organic acids and related intracellular metabolites were released into the liquor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Rice husk recalcitrance to saccharification is probably due to the much higher levels of lignin and, from other studies, likely high levels of silica. Therefore, if highly polluting chemical pre-treatments and multi-step biorefining processes are to be avoided, rice husk may need to be improved through selective breeding strategies, although more careful control of pre-treatment may be sufficient to reduce the levels of fermentation inhibitors, e.g. through steam explosion-induced volatilisation. For rice straw, pre-treating at severities of between 3.65 and 4.25 would give a glucose yield of between 37.5 and 40% (w/DW, dry weight of the substrate) close to the theoretical yield of 44.1% w/DW, and an insignificant yield of total inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13068-018-1062-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lignocellulosic biomass</kwd><kwd>Rice husk</kwd><kwd>Rice straw</kwd><kwd>Pre-treatment</kwd><kwd>Inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Saccharification</kwd><kwd>Xylo-oligomers</kwd><kwd>Fermentation</kwd><kwd>Bioethanol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004545/1</award-id><award-id>BB/J013838/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldron</surname><given-names>Keith W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">The energy crisis and how to address it has been long debated, encompassing a wide range of topics from the economic implications of climate change and &#x0201c;peak oil&#x0201d; to the improvements in technologies for producing renewable or low carbon energy. Renewable and low carbon electrical energy is a rapidly developing sector involving nuclear, wind power or photovoltaic technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the bulk of road vehicles require liquid fuels and this has led to global programmes for producing renewable biofuels that have the potential to be sustainable, and emit minimal levels of greenhouse gases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Of interest are second-generation biofuels such as cellulosic bioethanol. Cellulose is the most abundant source of glucose, and is found in lignocellulosic biomass and wastes including agricultural residues such as forestry residues and pulping wastes, cereal straws, and threshing husks, as well as food processing coproducts such as brewers spent grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As Rajaram and Varma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported in 1990, there were about 2900 million tonnes of lignocellulosic waste from cereal crops, 160 million tonnes from pulse crops, 14 million tonnes from oilseed crops and 540 million tonnes from plantation crops.</p><p id="Par16">Rice is one of the most widely grown cereal crops, with enormous levels of production in Asian countries leading to an abundance of rice husk and rice straw lignocellulosic wastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The world annual production of rice husk has been reported as approximately 120 million tonnes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Kim and Dale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported that 667.59 million tonnes rice straw were at that time produced in Asia, and Binod and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] calculated that this could theoretically be converted into 281.72 billion litres of ethanol.</p><p id="Par17">However, converting the cellulose and other cell wall sugars to ethanol is highly challenging due to the protective biochemical and structural nature of the lignocellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which hampers the hydrolysis of the polysaccharides to fermentable monosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Generically, the conversion processes employed comprise four main steps: hydrothermal pre-treatment, enzymatic or chemical saccharification, fermentation and purification. The aim of pre-treatment is to separate the lignin from the cellulose, reduce the structural barriers created by hemicelluloses, reduce cellulosic crystallinity and thereby improve the accessibility of cellulose to cellulases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The fermentable sugars released can be latterly converted to products by microorganisms such as bacteria and yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Finally, the product of interest can be recovered from the fermentation liquor, for example by distillation. Each of all those steps has a range of options, and the different combinations of those four steps can cause various results.</p><p id="Par18">Previously, we systematically demonstrated that rice straw and rice husk exhibit very different propensities for enzymatic saccharification and fermentation behaviour in response to steam explosion pre-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The aim of this study has been to evaluate in greater depth the differences in the composition of these lignocellulosic materials, and the changes that occur in them during hydrothermal pre-treatments relevant to their biorefining potential, with special reference to the release of potential fermentation inhibitors and related chemicals. This has been achieved by using enclosed hydrothermal pre-treatment conditions to avoid loss of volatile substances that might occur during steam explosion. Furthermore, by using variations of time and temperature, a much higher range of pre-treatment severities have been assessed. Conditions conducive to optimal simultaneous saccharification and fermentation have also been explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sugar and lignin analysis of air-dried rice husk and rice straw</title><p id="Par19">Sugar compositions in both rice husk and rice straw comprised rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and are in keeping with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Overall, reducing sugar and glucose both increased with increasing severity. Consistent with the results of steam explosion, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] enzymatic hydrolysis of hydrothermally pre-treated rice straw released much higher quantities of reducing sugars (maximum 66.1% at severity 4.27) and glucose (maximum 43.6% at severity 5.15) compared with rice husk (maximum 35.3% reducing sugar at severity 4.55 sugar and 16.3% glucose at severity 5.44). In rice husk, reducing sugar yield grew steadily with increasing severity up to 4.5 then slowly decreased, whilst glucose yield continued to increase at above this severity. In rice straw, reducing sugar yield reached a peak at a severity of 4.3 and then decreased rapidly at higher pre-treatment severities. In contrast to husk, the peak of glucose yield (at a severity of 4.8) was followed by a decrease in glucose yield at higher severities. Thus under similar conditions of pre-treatment and enzyme loading, significantly higher sugar and glucose yields were achieved from rice straw compared with rice husk.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Saccharification of pre-treated rice straw and husk.

Acetoin and glycolic acid increased consistently from low severities to high severities, but glycerol, pyruvic and 2-oxoglutarate started to decrease after reaching their peaks indicating degradation. Ethanol was produced in small quantities from both PTRH and PTRS (at higher severities). Betaine levels and trends differed between PTRH and PTRS, showing marked degradation at higher severities in PTRH.</p><p id="Par25">At moderate pre-treatment severities, sugars and oligosaccharides were released (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These all showed similar trends in that the levels peaked at around a severity of 4.5 after which they decreased, presumably due to degradation (concomitant with the increase in fermentation inhibitors shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Generally, rice husk released higher amounts of sugar compounds than rice straw at any given severity. The presence of galactose may reflect the hydrolysis of small quantities of pectic polymers in the cereal biomass, whilst the xylose, xylo-oligomers and arabinose are likely to be derived from xylans and arabinoxylan hemicelluloses.</p><p id="Par26">Compounds known to cause significant inhibition on saccharification or fermentation were released at higher severities and are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In keeping with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], most of the inhibitors increased with increasing severities. Hydroxy-methyl furfural (5-HMF), furfural (2-FA) and acetic acid were the most abundant inhibitors produced from both PTRH and PTRS. Complementing Wood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], considerably higher levels of all the inhibitors were produced from rice husk at the higher severities, consistent with the higher levels of sugar release and breakdown shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. However in the present study, the levels of 5-HMF, 2-FA and acetic acid produced at the much higher severities were very much greater than those reported by Wood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (confirmed by HPLC&#x02014;results not shown). This may be due to two factors: firstly, in the previous study, the maximum pre-treatment severity was 4.8, whilst in this study the severity went to higher levels; secondly, it is very likely that considerable quantities of these volatile compounds were lost into the vented steam during the explosion process. Measurable amounts of formic acid, acetol, acetaldehyde and methanol were also produced significantly from pre-treated samples. Choline and levulinic acid were produced at much lower levels than the other inhibitors and were produced more from PTRS than PTRH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">Rice straw and husk are important sources of biomass globally and have similar chemical compositions. However, after identical hydrothermal pre-treatments, rice husk is poorly saccharifiable, produces higher levels of fermentation inhibitors and yields much less ethanol during SSF. There are several factors that may be responsible for the higher recalcitrance. Firstly, the level of lignin is considerably higher in rice husk. This will not only act as a dense, physical barrier to enzymolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but will also provide a larger physical surface onto which cellulases may bind strongly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], reducing the availability of free enzyme. Secondly, larger quantities of xylose and xylo-oligosaccharides are released during pre-treatment of rice husk compared with those released from rice straw (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) at concentrations calculated to be in the order of over 1&#x000a0;mg/ml. Such concentrations have been shown to severely inhibit cellulase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thirdly, whilst not assessed in this study, rice straw and rice husk contain considerably higher levels of silica in their cell walls compared with other cereal lignocellulose, and it is much higher in rice husk than in rice straw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Silica has a severe impact on ruminant digestibility of rice straw and husk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and would therefore be expected to have an impact on the digestibility of pre-treated rice biomass. Many researchers have shown that it is possible to use very harsh chemicals to overcome rice straw and husk recalcitrance by extracting lignin and other structural barriers to enzymolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For example, Ang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compared a range of additions of chemicals and reached 22.3% (w/w) yield of total sugar after pre-treating rice husk by adding HCl without any further hydrolysis. Saha and Cotta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] used alkaline peroxide to achieve a saccharification yield of 42.8% (w/w). Recently, Khaleghian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] demonstrated that the chemical removal of silica after previously removing lignin considerably enhances saccharification. However, such treatments generally employ very large quantities of chemicals, often of the same order of magnitude as the biomass being treated. This will be costly both financially and environmentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is clear that further studies on the role of silica in recalcitrance are required.</p><p id="Par28">The in-depth study of pre-treatment liquors by NMR has also shown that hydrothermal (hot water) pre-treatments retain large amounts of commonly known fermentation inhibitors and a range of other compounds. These have a highly deleterious impact on fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Whilst they could be removed by washing the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this would add a further processing step and would remove much of the solubilised sugars which may also be exploited in a single processing step using modified fermenting organisms that can ferment pentoses effectively. However, we have also suggested that some might be substantially removed by volatilisation during steam explosion. Some moieties have varying functionality. For example at low severities, acetaldehyde was produced at concentrations (0.01&#x000a0;mg/ml) that can enhance fermentation through reducing the lag phase of yeast growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], whilst at higher severities acetaldehyde was produced at concentrations (over 0.1&#x000a0;mg/ml) where it can inhibit yeast growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Metabolites and organic acids produced in small quantities at low severities are not generally recognised. Such moieties could act as substrates for the fermenting microorganism.</p><p id="Par29">Whilst the development of economically viable pre-treatments for rice husk remains a considerable challenge, it may be possible to develop a tractable processing regime for rice straw. In this study, RS samples pre-treated between severities of 3.65 and 4.25 would give a promising yield of glucose which is circa 10% lower than the maximum yield (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Also, at the severity of 3.65, the levels of inhibitors are on the lower end of the range and their volatilisation by steam explosion may reduce them further. Future exploitation of rice husk may require targeted breeding strategies to address the recalcitrant properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par30">Rice straw and husk are important global sources of biomass for biorefining. Rice husk presents a much greater degree of post-hydrothermal pre-treatment recalcitrance compared with rice straw due, probably, to high levels of lignin and silica. It also produces higher levels of fermentation inhibitors during hydrothermal pre-treatment. In-depth analysis of the pre-treatment liquors by NMR has identified a wide range of components created throughout the severity range. At low severities, metabolites including organic acids are extracted&#x02014;these are generally broken down at severities above 4. At mid-range severities, a range of sugars and oligosaccharides are released presumably through hydrolysis of cell wall polysaccharides; many of these are lost at the highest severities where there is a rapid increase in well-established fermentation inhibitors. It is postulated that these might be reduced by volatilisation through steam explosion, rather than adding additional washing steps that would lose many potentially fermentable components.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials and methodology</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Raw materials</title><p id="Par31">Rice husk and straw were provided as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Milling substrates</title><p id="Par32">Air-dried rice husk and straw (200&#x000a0;g) were chopped with scissors into about 2&#x000a0;cm lengths and then micronised using a RETSCH cyclone mill (Retsch Limited, Hope Valley, United Kingdom) with a 0.5&#x000a0;mm mesh.
