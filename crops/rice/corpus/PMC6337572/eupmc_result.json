    "Asparagine is one of the important amino acids for long-distance transport of nitrogen (N) in plants. However, little is known about the effect of asparagine on plant development, especially in crops. Here, a new T-DNA insertion mutant, asparagine synthetase 1 (asn1), was isolated and showed a different plant height, root length, and tiller number compared with wild type (WT). In asn1, the amount of asparagine decreased sharply while the total nitrogen (N) absorption was not influenced. In later stages, asn1 showed reduced tiller number, which resulted in suppressed tiller bud outgrowth. The relative expression of many genes involved in the asparagine metabolic pathways declined in accordance with the decreased amino acid concentration. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutant lines of OsASN1 showed similar phenotype with asn1. These results suggest that OsASN1 is involved in the regulation of rice development and is specific for tiller outgrowth."
