    "The present study was performed to investigate the influence of tara gum (TG) addition on the steady and dynamic shear rheological properties of rice starch (RS) isolated from the Korean rice variety 'Boramchan' flour. From X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectra of RS, it was found that RS was purely isolated. All RS+TG pastes (4.7:0.3, 4.5:0.5, and 4.3:0.7, w/w) showed shear-thinning fluid characteristics. Adding TG significantly increased the values of apparent viscosity and consistency index of RS. In the dynamic shear rheological analysis, the dynamic moduli and complex viscosity of RS+TG pastes were significantly greater than those of the RS paste, indicating that RS+TG pastes had significantly higher viscoelastic properties than the RS paste. Light microscopy images of RS+TG pastes showed that the addition of TG can inhibit the RS granule from swelling."
