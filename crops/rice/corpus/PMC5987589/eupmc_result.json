    "BACKGROUND:Exploiting soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere of plants can significantly improve agricultural productivity; however, the mechanism by which microorganisms specifically affect agricultural productivity is poorly understood. To clarify this uncertainly, the rhizospheric microbial communities of super rice plants at various growth stages were analysed using 16S rRNA high-throughput gene sequencing; microbial communities were then related to soil properties and rice productivity. RESULTS:The rhizospheric bacterial communities were characterized by the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia during all stages of rice growth. Rice production differed by approximately 30% between high- and low-yield sites that had uniform fertilization regimes and climatic conditions, suggesting the key role of microbial communities. Mantel tests showed a strong correlation between soil conditions and rhizospheric bacterial communities, and microorganisms had different effects on crop yield. Among the four growing periods, the rhizospheric bacterial communities present during the heading stage showed a more significant correlation (p <  0.05) with crop yield, suggesting their potential in regulating crop production. The biological properties (i.e., microbes) reflected the situation of agricultural land better than the physicochemical characterics (i.e., nutrient elements), which provides theoretical support for agronomic production. Molecular ecological network (MEN) analysis suggested that differences in productivity were caused by the interaction between the soil characteristics and the bacterial communities. CONCLUSIONS:During the heading stage of rice cropping, the rhizospheric microbial community is vital for the resulting rice yield. According to network analysis, the cooperative relationship (i.e., positive interaction) between between microbes may contribute significantly to yield, and the biological properties (i.e., microbes) better reflected the real conditions of agricultural land than did the physicochemical characteristics (i.e., nutrient elements)."
