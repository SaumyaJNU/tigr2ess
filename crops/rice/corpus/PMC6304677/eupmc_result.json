    "Domestication has been of major interest to biologists for centuries, whether for creating new plants and animal types or more formally exploring the principles of evolution. Such studies have long used combinations of phenotypic and genetic evidence. Recently, the advent of a large number of genomes and genomic tools across a wide array of domesticated plant and animal species has reinvigorated the study of domestication. These genomic data, which can be easily generated for nearly any species, often provide great insight with or without a reference genome. The comparison of genome wide data from domestic and wild species has ignited a wave of insight into human, plant, and animal history with a new range of questions becoming accessible. With this in mind, this issue of Evolutionary Applications includes eleven papers covering a wide range of perspectives and methodologies relevant to understanding genomic variation under domestication."
