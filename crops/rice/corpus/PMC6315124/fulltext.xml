However, the genetic and transcriptomic factors involved in this process are largely unknown. In this study, transcripts affecting shoot weight were identified in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from 20 backcrossed inbred lines (BILs) and their parental cultivars. The selection frequency of the genes for the regression model was determined using repeated analysis of random subsets of the transcriptome. The <italic>qLTG3-1</italic>gene, controlling low-temperature germinability, and short grain 1 gene (<italic>SG1</italic>), known to decrease organ elongation, showed high frequency. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis performed for BILs revealed that <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> was included in the QTLs for shoot weight but <italic>SG1</italic> was not. No nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the coding region of <italic>SG1</italic> in either of the parental cultivars. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that <italic>SG1</italic> expression was negatively correlated with shoot weight for all 104 BILs analyzed in this study. Expression QTL (eQTLs) analysis showed an eQTL for <italic>SG1</italic> expression located in the same region as the QTL for shoot weight. However, no eQTLs were detected on the same chromosome as <italic>SG1</italic>, suggesting that nucleotide polymorphisms around the gene do not affect its expression in analyzed growth stage. Overall, these results indicate that RNA-Seq is a useful tool for identifying transcripts that can be related to seedling growth rate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>eQTL</kwd><kwd>LASSO</kwd><kwd><italic>Oryza sativa</italic></kwd><kwd>qLTG3-1</kwd><kwd>QTL</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd><italic>SG1</italic></kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="24"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Direct seeding of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is less laborious and costly than transplanting but has some limitations. Early seedling growth, for example, is an essential process during direct seeding, and delayed growth results in increased seedling mortality (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Peterson, 1976</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ogiwara and Terashima, 2001</xref>). Therefore, although seedling growth rate and other agronomical traits have been suggested to be regulated by complex genetic and environment interactions, it is important to elucidate the genetic factors involved in enhancing these traits, as this will allow selecting preferable traits during rice breeding to improve the efficacy of direct seeding. One tool used to identify genetic factors affecting agronomical traits is quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis, which was previously performed to evaluate traits affecting seedling vigor (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Iwata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Yano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). However, QTLs analysis is laborious, time consuming, and only reveals genomic mutations; in some cases, it also involves significant genetic bias.</p><p>Another method to elucidate the physiological traits involved in a process or phenotype is transcriptomic analysis based on RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which measures gene expression in an unbiased genome-wide manner. This technique has been used to reveal genes related to many endogenous and environmentally influenced agronomical traits. This includes analysis of differential gene expression in groups of plants subject to specific environmental conditions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Plessis et al., 2015</xref>), which has been used to establish statistical models to predict gene expression dynamics under various field conditions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Matsuzaki et al., 2015</xref>). Transcriptomics has also been used to predict individual plant traits. In maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.), &#x0201c;expression biomarkers&#x0201d; calculated using a linear regression model of transcriptomic gene expression can be used to predict nitrogen sensitivity status (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). However, this kind of transcriptomic analysis has not yet been applied to study seedling growth rate in rice.</p><p>In the present study, rice cultivars with varying shoot weights were subject to RNA-Seq to identify genes whose expression can influence seedling growth rate. Backcrossed inbred lines (BILs) were produced with Arroz da Terra, which has a rapid initial growth rate, as the donor parent and Ouu365 as the recipient parent (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). Both parental cultivars and BILs were analyzed and, interestingly, all analyzed plants had different shoot weights. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an unbiased, statistical approach has been used to select genes which expression is related to shoot weight/seedling growth in rice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Growth Conditions</title><p>The parental strains Ouu365 and Arroz da Terra, as well as the BILs used in the present study, were developed as described previously (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). Seeds were sterilized for 1 h in 50-fold diluted antiformin, rinsed three times in tap water, and imbibed in water at 30&#x000b0;C for 2 days in an incubator. Twenty-four germinated seeds per line were sown on floating plates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2012</xref>), which were floated on hydroponic culture solution containing 0.35 mM NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, 0.18 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.27 mM K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.46 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.36 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05 mM FeSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi and Chino, 1986</xref>). The pH of the hydroponic culture solution was adjusted to 5.5, and the solution was replaced every 2 days. The seedlings were grown in a chamber LH-240 (Nippon Medical and Chemical Instruments, Osaka, Japan) for 14 days at 20&#x000b0;C under a 12-h artificial light and 12-h dark cycle. The light was radiated with 64&#x02013;79 &#x003bc;mol m-2 s-1 of photosynthetically active radiation by the neutral white fluorescent lamp. The positions of the floating plates were changed every 2 days in the chamber.</p></sec><sec><title>QTL Analysis</title><p>The parental cultivars and all 104 BILs were grown in the chamber as described above. For all lines, growth experiments were repeated three times in independent periods. The seedlings of 104 BILs and parental cultivars were harvested 14 days after germination and oven dried at 80&#x000b0;C for 2 days. Seeds and roots were then removed from each seedling, and shoot dry weight per line was determined. The mean value of three biological replicates of shoot dry weight was used for QTL analysis. The genotypes of BILs were previously analyzed using 124 simple sequence repeat markers (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). Information on the simple sequence repeat markers is listed in GRAMENE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref></sup> We also used a marker which detect 71-bp deletion in the <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> gene (RAP ID: Os03g0103300) on chromosome 3 with the S103a primers (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Fujino et al., 2008</xref>). While the Ouu365 allele presented the 71-bp deletion in its open reading frame (ORF), Arroz da Terra did not (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, we designed a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism marker (PCR-RFLP marker) that detect a single nucleotide change in the &#x02013;1948 bp region upstream the translational start site of <italic>SG 1</italic> gene (RAP ID: Os09g0459200) on chromosome 9.

In this analysis, the Arroz da Terra allele would be digested, while that of Ouu365 would not thereby allowing their discrimination.

Twenty-four seedlings per line were grown as described above. The seeds and roots of the seedlings were removed 14 days after germination. After weighing, fresh shoots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Total RNA was extracted from 24 shoot samples in each line using an RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The quality and quantity of RNA were assessed with a 2100-Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). One biological replicate was conducted in each line. The 22 RNA samples were used to produce sequencing libraries with the TruSeq RNA LT Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, United States), which were sequenced as 100-bp single-end reads in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The resulting Fastq files have been deposited into the DNA Data Bank of Japan Sequence Read Archive (DRA; accession no. DRA006312). Sequence data were mapped to the <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>-Nipponbare-Reference-IRGSP-1.0 genome assembly (Oryza sativa.IRGSP-1.0.24.dna.toplevel.fa.gz<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn03">3</xref></sup>) and gene set (Oryza sativa.IRGSP-1.0.24.gtf.gz<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn04">4</xref></sup>) using TopHat2 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Transcript expression was calculated as fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) based on the number of uniquely mapped reads that overlapped exon regions. Sequencing of RNA and estimation of transcript expression were performed by Takara Bio Inc. (Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Selection Frequency</title><p>In general, the differential expression analysis between the opposite extreme trait groups need replicates to decrease the noise. However, most traits of organisms are continuous and could not be separated into two opposite groups. Furthermore, it is difficult to take replications in the natural situations, because of the samples under certain conditions could be collected only once. Therefore, we tried the new statistical approach to select the transcripts affecting the gradient traits. In this study, one sample represented one state, and it was used for statistical analysis without replicate. To determine which transcripts were correlated with shoot fresh weight and the selection frequencies for the explanatory variables, we used the 37,043 genes whose average expression was above 0.01 in our RNA-Seq analysis data. Overview of the method to assess the selection frequencies of the genes for the explanatory variables is presented on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Gene expression values were log2-transformed after adding 0.01 to each FPKM value. Explanatory variables were determined using a L1-regularized linear regression model constructed with LASSO (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>). To assess gene selection frequencies, we repeatedly evaluated explanatory variables using subsets of the transcriptome. Among the 3,704 genes (10% of the transcriptome) randomly selected and used as input variables for LASSO, eight presented non-zero coefficients in LASSO (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>), and were, therefore, designated as explanatory variables. The subset selection and explanatory variables determination steps were repeated 10,000 times. Gene selection frequency was defined as the ratio of trials in which the gene could be used as an explanatory variable to the total number of trials. The analysis was conducted with the R glmnet package (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2015</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn05">5</xref></sup> A list of selected genes with frequencies larger than 0.01 is provided in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">1</xref>.

Techniques such as QTL and RNA-Seq analyses provide the means to evaluate the genetic code and expression profile reflecting specific morphological and physiological traits. Although QTL analysis was previously performed to evaluate traits affecting rice seedling size and growth rate (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Iwata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Yano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>), RNA-Seq has never been applied to study the rice transcriptome for initial growth rate. Thus, we analyzed 20 BILs and their parental cultivars using RNA-Seq to identify genes that influence initial growth rate.</p><p>One of the main findings of this study was that <italic>SG1</italic> appears to be functionally significant during initial growth rate specification. It has been shown that <italic>SG1</italic> upregulation decreases organ elongation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>), although it was not clear if <italic>SG1</italic> expression differed among natural rice lines. Our results indicate that <italic>SG1</italic> expression is negatively correlated with shoot weight in the lines used for the RNA-Seq. Moreover, our qRT-PCR analysis showed that this negative correlation was not only present in the lines used for RNA-Seq, but in all 104 BILs, suggesting that <italic>SG1</italic> expression levels might affect the growth rate of rice seedlings. These results also highlight an important technical finding as it appears that RNA-Seq analysis of 22 random and representative rice lines were useful to predict functional genes for the initial growth rate of a much larger population.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Relationships between short grain 1 (<italic>SG1</italic>) expression and shoot fresh weight for all the 104 BILs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.

However, natural <italic>SG1</italic> mutations have not been reported, and no nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the coding region of <italic>SG1</italic> in the parental cultivars Ouu365 and Arroz da Terra in the present study. Although the upstream promoter region of <italic>SG1</italic> contained nucleotide substitutions, these changes did not affect <italic>SG1</italic> expression and no eQTLs were located on the same chromosomal region as the <italic>SG1</italic> gene. These results indicate that the differences in <italic>SG1</italic> expression level between the Ouu365 and Arroz da Terra lines are not greatly affected by genomic substitutions upstream of the gene. Furthermore, this analysis showed that RNA-Seq analysis effectively detects transcripts that do not have genomic mutations. It is important to note, however, that an eQTL for <italic>SG1</italic> and one of the known QTLs for shoot weight were co-located in a region of chromosome 7, suggesting that this area might contain transcription factors that regulate <italic>SG1</italic> expression. Additional work is necessary to identify the regulatory factor(s) responsible for the observed differences in <italic>SG1</italic> expression.</p><p>Another important aspect of our study involved comparing the QTLs for BILs&#x02019; shoot weight and the high frequency selected gene <italic>qLTG3-1</italic>, which affected germination speed, and is included in the QTL region of chromosome 3. Arroz da Terra is reported to have the functional <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> allele, while the Ouu365 allele contains a 71-bp loss of function deletion in its ORF (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Fujino and Iwata, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>). The functional <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> allele is known to accelerate germination speed (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Fujino et al., 2008</xref>) and pre-harvest sprouting (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2010</xref>), although the effects of <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> after the germination stage are unclear. In the present study, <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> alleles resulted in differences in gene expression and shoot weight, suggesting that <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> affects the seedling growth rate after the germination stage. Thus, combined analysis of QTLs and transcriptomic sequencing effectively detects QTL candidate genes, as previously reported (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Yano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, QTLs and microarray analyses of substitution lines carrying a QTL allele were previously used to detect candidate genes encoding gibberellin oxidases that are involved in rice shoot length (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Yano et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, RNA-Seq of bulk recombinant inbred lines that had extremely high or low grain chalkiness was also used to evaluate QTL candidate genes for this trait (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, the transcriptome data obtained for the 20 BILs and parental cultivars were successfully used to detect QTL candidate genes, without generating substitution or extreme-trait lines.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, our data demonstrates that transcriptome analysis is a powerful method for determining the expression profiles reflecting the morphological and physiological traits of an organism. As these expression profiles can be affected by many environmental and genetic factors, and involve complex interactions and signaling pathways, the statistical approaches used to identify functional genes commonly need huge sample sizes to decrease noise. However, using a relatively small number of samples, 20 BILs and two parental cultivars, we successfully identified genes that affect shoot weight, suggesting that a relatively small sample size can still be effective in this type of analysis. However, the need for a large sample size might have been surpassed by the controlled conditions in which rice cultivars were grown. Further, we also used BILs that have similar genetic backgrounds, thus limiting genetic complexity. It is, therefore, important to note that using transcriptomic data from strains with various genetic backgrounds, under variable environmental conditions, might require a larger sample size than that used here to identify functional genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we utilized both QTL and RNA-Seq analyses to identify candidate genes for shoot weight in rice. This analysis revealed that <italic>qLTG3-1</italic> and <italic>SG1</italic> might influence seedling growth rate. Because the environmental conditions and genetic background in our experiments were constant, a large sample size was not required. As this is the first time this unbiased, statistical approach has been used to select candidate genes whose expression is related to shoot weight/seedling growth in rice, additional work is required to better understand the function and regulation of these genes. Because seedling growth is an important trait during direct seeding, this study provides essential information for rice agronomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AF, TH, NA, SK, MY, CO, and AN conceived and designed the research.
