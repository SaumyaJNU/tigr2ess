Although the carbon assimilation pathway is highly conserved across species, metabolic phenotypes could differ in composition, type, and quantity. To unravel the metabolic complexity and advantage of cassava over other starch crops, in terms of starch production, we investigated the carbon assimilation mechanisms in cassava through genome-based pathway reconstruction and comparative network analysis. First, MeRecon &#x02014; the carbon assimilation pathway of cassava was reconstructed based upon six plant templates: Arabidopsis, rice, maize, castor bean, potato, and turnip. MeRecon, available at http://bml.sbi.kmutt.ac.th/MeRecon, comprises 259 reactions (199 EC numbers), 1,052 proteins (870 genes) and 259 metabolites in eight sub-metabolisms. Analysis of MeRecon and the carbon assimilation pathways of the plant templates revealed the overall topology is highly conserved, but variations at sub metabolism level were found in relation to complexity underlying each biochemical reaction, such as numbers of responsible enzymatic proteins and their evolved functions, which likely explain the distinct metabolic phenotype. Thus, this study provides insights into the network characteristics and mechanisms that regulate the synthesis of metabolic phenotypes of cassava.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Metabolism is the foundation of cellular regulation in living organisms. It is where biological regulatory factors express their modulating actions in pursuit of normal cellular activities, resulting in the diverse survival behaviors observed in various environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Primary metabolic pathways for cellular survival, such as those involved in carbon assimilation, are typically conserved across taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The conservation of these pathways is high among organisms within a kingdom, e.g. Archaebacteria, Animalia, and Plantae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> as well as across ancestral kingdoms. Preservation of metabolic pathways is evidenced by heredity in organisms that share evolutionary lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With these highly conserved metabolic pathways, similarities in the metabolic processes as well as the overall context of metabolism (i.e., types of metabolic compounds within the cell) are expected. Despite the conserved metabolic pathways, some evolutionarily related organisms have different spectrum of metabolic compounds, especially regarding their accumulated metabolites. For example, phyto-products within crops of the Euphobiaceae family include: starch from cassava (<italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz), latex rubber from rubber tree (<italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic>), and triacylglycerols (TAGs) from physic nut (<italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> L.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Cassava is an important source of calories, especially for poor households in the tropics. Its starch is synthesized and stored in underground roots making up 70&#x02013;85 percent of the total dry weight of cassava roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with very low protein and lipid contents compared to cereal grains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although the metabolic pathway of starch biosynthesis is highly conserved amongst starch crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, starch yield varies. For example, cassava yields more starch in comparison with rice, maize, and potato. To gain insight into the complexity of metabolism and unravel the metabolic advantage of cassava over other starch crops in terms of starch production, direct comparison of the constituent metabolic reactions is insufficient. In addition, there is need to understand the enzymatic proteins involved as well as their biochemical properties and functions.</p><p id="Par4">Comprehensive understanding of interspecies differences in metabolism extends beyond the knowledge about individual genes and gene functions. The metabolic processes underlying metabolism involve about 15&#x02013;20 percent of protein-coding genes in genomes, related to thousands of enzymes in the metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The cooperative role of these genes is represented by the metabolic network, the series of biochemical reactions describing the conversion of substrates to products of metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The large number of genes governing the metabolic processes introduces complexity into the metabolic network, of which metabolic flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> due to redundancy in reactions and metabolic paths are indicative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, system-level analysis is crucial to comprehensively study metabolic processes in living organisms; it might be the only way to access the hidden factors behind the distinct metabolic characteristics of organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have enabled studies on the global metabolic capabilities that help define metabolism. The exponential growth of genome sequencing projects in the last decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and the availability of complete genome sequences for a number of organisms have provided a plethora of resources for comparative genomics studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and have made finding results more promising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These resources have facilitated the large-scale reconstruction of metabolic pathways for a wide range of species, especially for non-model organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The biochemical reactions in cellular metabolism are inferred from information in publicly available databases: species-specific databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and metabolic pathway omnibus databases such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, PMN (Plant Metabolic Network)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, MetaCyc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and BioCyc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Genome-scale metabolic pathway reconstruction enhances our understanding of metabolic characteristics and capabilities.</p><p id="Par6">The comparison of reconstructed metabolic pathways could reveal conserved as well as diverged metabolic pathways linked to distinct metabolic phenotypes in closely related species. The findings would highlight the crucial metabolic paths which are conserved in various species throughout the phylogenetic lineage as well as underline the special paths required to retain the specific metabolic activity of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. For example, the comparative analysis of four halophilic archaea species: <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>, <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic>, <italic>Haloquadratum walsbyi</italic>, and <italic>Natronomonas pharaonis</italic> demonstrated similarities in nucleotides and prenyl-based lipids synthesis and differences in glycerol degradation, pentose metabolism, and folate synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, metabolic routes for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis related to lipid production are present in oleaginous fungi (<italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic>, and <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic>), but are absent in non-oleaginous strains (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic>) as determined by comparative analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to these metabolic paths, the characteristics of metabolism may also be explained by the number of enzymatic protein isoforms (multiple proteins that perform the same function), heteromeric enzyme complexes (more than one subunit required for carrying out the enzymatic function), and enzymes that catalyze several reactions which determine the flexibility of metabolic conversion of substrates to products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While there is no absolute way for investigating metabolism, detailed study including extensive features would help to decode the metabolic characteristics underlying the distinct behaviors.</p><p id="Par7">To examine the metabolic characteristics of cassava that facilitate starch production, we reconstructed the carbon assimilation pathway using a comparative genomic approach based on multiple template plants proposed by Saithong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> with the inclusion of turnip &#x02014; a starchy root crop as cassava, to enhance the protein annotation. In order to reflect the complexity of carbon metabolism in cassava, the pathways of amino acid, cell wall, fatty acid, and nucleotide biosynthesis and respiration were incorporated into MeRecon in addition to those of starch and sucrose biosynthesis and the Calvin cycle as contained in Saithong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Analysis of MeRecon pathway allowed us to characterize the complexity of carbon metabolism in cassava in comparison to the template plants. The results revealed that although the overall topology was highly conserved, differences at sub-metabolism level were found, especially in non-carbohydrate related pathways. In addition, our study showed that some enzymatic proteins of cassava evolved from their ancestral orthologues, as exemplified by phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (EC 2.7.9.2; PEPS) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD<sup>+</sup>) (EC 1.2.1.3; ALDH), which could explain the distinct metabolic pathway of cassava and might result in functional adaptation of enzymatic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reconstruction of the metabolic pathway</title><p id="Par8">The carbon assimilation pathway of cassava (MeRecon) was reconstructed based upon the plant genomic data from various databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), and the metabolic pathway information from KEGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and PMN databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The observed complexity could be due to the extensive number of metabolic components (e.g., reactions, enzymes, proteins, and metabolic compounds) or their complicated association in cellular metabolism. For a metabolic process, biochemical reactions not only link up in a sequential manner, but also are interconnected through common metabolic intermediate compounds. Enzymes are typically required to convert substrates to products in a biochemical reaction, but the enzyme-to-reaction proportion often varies. Some enzymes with different amino acid sequences are often involved in the same biochemical reaction (isozymes) with overlapped function, e.g., acid phosphatase (ACP; EC 3.1.3.2), esterases (EST; EC 3.1.1.1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC 1.1.1.37), and shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH; EC 1.1.1.15) isozymes in cassava<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, enzymatic proteins often necessitate intricate regulatory pathway to pursue their normal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, such as the heteromeric enzyme complex (protein complex). The complication, thus, would even increase for enzymes that require multiple amino acid sequences to perform their catalytic activity. These scenarios introduce flexibility and complexity into the carbon metabolic network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>).

The number of proteins annotated to an enzyme may suggest the isozyme or protein complex scenario. Fifty-nine percent of enzymes (117/199 EC numbers) in cassava carbon assimilation pathway (MeRecon) were annotated to five proteins or less, while only 18 percent (35/199) contained more than 10 proteins with similar functional annotation. For instance, 28 proteins were annotated to the same enzymatic function as cellulose synthase (EC 2.4.1.12) in the cell wall biosynthesis sub-metabolism.

On average, more than six proteins were annotated to each enzyme in the carbohydrate-related sub-metabolic pathways, in contrast to three proteins that were annotated to each enzyme in non-carbohydrate-related sub-metabolic pathways, namely nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B,C</xref>).

Most organisms share overlapping groups of enzymatic reactions, even though the metabolic behavior, i.e. product types and accumulation levels, appear to be diverse. For example, cassava, synthesizes higher amount of starch than other starch crops. To understand this metabolic advantage, this study aimed to decipher the code of metabolic conservation beyond conserved sequences of orthologous enzymatic proteins. The overall structure of the carbon assimilation pathway, the metabolic functions of the sub-metabolic networks, the biochemical properties of enzymes in each sub-metabolism, and the enzymatic function of proteins were analyzed systematically to gain insights into the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the unique starch yield in cassava. The conservation of pathway topology was first investigated through the similarity analysis of the metabolic reactions of the pathway. Then, for each individual sub-metabolism, the functional conservation was examined based on the enzymes (EC numbers) and enzymatic proteins involved in the pathway.

The biochemical reactions involved in carbon assimilation in cassava and other plant species were similar (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Sixty-eight percent of the metabolic reactions (175 of 256), corresponding to 126 EC numbers were present in the carbon assimilation pathway of all representative plant species. They were distributed, though not uniformly, across all eight sub-metabolic pathways of cassava carbon assimilation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). These common metabolic reactions represent a group of primary biochemical reactions that are essential for plants to assimilate carbon to macromolecules. Starch biosynthesis showed the most conserved biochemical reaction constituents of all pathways, whereas cell wall and nucleotide biosynthesis exhibited the least conservation. The common reactions covered at least half of the biochemical reactions in each sub-metabolism, implying that the metabolic function is well conserved in plant species. However, some functional dissimilarity was expressed at sub-metabolism level as a result of some evolutionarily developed reactions. Some metabolic reactions of cassava were found to be conserved in specific template species. This could account for the uniqueness of cassava metabolic pathway. For examples, alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP<sup>+</sup>) (EC 1.1.1.2), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (EC 2.7.9.2) and guanosine ribohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.1), and deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74) were specifically annotated from rice, maize, and potato, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Conservation of metabolic functions of cassava carbon assimilation pathway based on EC numbers (enzymes) with respect to the representative plant species (<bold>a</bold>).

Here, we investigated the conservation of enzymatic protein functions based on the conserved amino acid sequences. Utilization of metabolic substrates by the action of enzymatic proteins may be affected by variation in amino acid sequences. Two proteins, namely, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (EC 2.7.9.2; PEPS) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD<sup>+</sup>) (EC 1.2.1.3; ALDH) were selected to demonstrate the conservation and possible variations in enzymatic functions. A reaction driven by PEPS (R00199) was reconstructed in MeRecon using the PEPS cassava protein, MeRecon: 000266_000266, annotated from maize, with high sequence similarity.

First, MeRecon pathway was reconstructed using comparative genomic approach based upon annotated cassava enzymatic proteins from six plant templates. Reaction gaps were filled using cassava enzymatic proteins obtained from the CassavaCyc database. The MeRecon pathway consists of 199 EC numbers (enzymes), 259 reactions, 259 metabolites, 870 genes, and 1,052 proteins. More than 95 annotated enzymatic proteins were validated using either the six cassava transcriptome datasets or the cloned sequences of cassava that were obtained from GenBank database or both when available. Based on the complexity analysis (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>P/E</italic></sub>) of MeRecon pathway, the carbohydrate-related sub-metabolisms may require higher enzymatic protein complexity (i.e., protein subunit complex or isozymes) for their functions compared to non-carbohydrate sub-metabolisms. In addition, the MeRecon pathway was compared to the six model plants with respect to pathway topology, metabolic function of sub-metabolisms, biochemical properties of enzymes in each sub-metabolism, and enzymatic function of proteins. Although the topology and metabolic function were highly conserved across templates, different enzyme properties and enzymatic function of proteins were identified which might affect the synthesis of metabolic compounds and the global metabolic behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
