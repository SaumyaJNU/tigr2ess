    "Cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) family was characterized for their expression and functions in Populus trichocarpa. Ten members, PtrCslD1-10, were identified in the P. trichocarpa genome, and they belong to 4 clades by phylogenetic tree analysis. qRT-PCR and promoter:GUS assays in Arabidopsis and P. trichocarpa displayed divergent expression patterns of these 10 PtrCSLD genes in root hairs, root tips, leaves, vascular tissues, xylem and flowers. Among PtrCslD2, PtrCslD4, PtrCslD5, PtrCslD6, and PtrCslD8 that all exhibited expression in root hairs, only PtrCslD5 could restore the root hairless phenotype of the atcsld3 mutant, demonstrating that PtrCslD5 is the functional ortholog of AtCslD3 for root hair formation. Our results suggest more possible functions for other PtrCslD genes in poplar."
