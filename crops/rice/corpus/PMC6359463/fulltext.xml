Low temperature is one of the major environmental stress that impair jojoba&#x02019;s growth, development and yield and limit introduction of jojoba in the vast temperate arid areas. To get insight into the molecular mechanisms of the cold stress response of jojoba, a combined physiological and quantitative proteomic analysis was conducted. Under cold stress, the photosynthesis was repressed, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), relative electrolyte leakage (REL), soluble sugars, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were increased in jojoba leaves. Of the 2821 proteins whose abundance were determined, a total of 109 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) were found and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the coding genes for 7 randomly selected DAPs were performed for validation. The identified DAPs were involved in various physiological processes. Functional classification analysis revealed that photosynthesis, adjustment of cytoskeleton and cell wall, lipid metabolism and transport, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and carbohydrate metabolism were closely associated with the cold stress response. Some cold-induced proteins, such as cold-regulated 47 (COR47), staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3-like a (STT3a), phytyl ester synthase 1 (PES1) and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1, might play important roles in cold acclimation in jojoba seedlings.

Introduction</title><p>Jojoba, <italic>Simmondsia chinensis</italic> (link) Schneider, also called wild hazel, deer nut, oat nut and coffeeberry, is an important and unique oil crop. The importance lies in the crushing oil of its seeds&#x02014;jojoba oil has a wide range of commercial applications, including cosmetic formulations, food products and aerospace lubricants [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The composition and physical properties of the oil extracted from Jojoba seeds are similar to those of sperm oil and thus jojoba oil is a promising alternative to the threatened sperm whale oil [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Its uniqueness lies in two aspects, on the one hand, jojoba oil is a kind of vegetable oils with unique physical property and no other vegetable oil has physical properties comparable to jojoba oil. On the other hand, jojoba is a dryland crop and jojoba can be grown in deserts and various arid land areas without competing with common crops for farmland. Jojoba exhibit extremely high level of tolerance to drought and high temperature stresses and jojoba is proposed to have the ability to curb desert expansion around the world [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Jojoba is a desert shrub native to the semi-arid region of the Sonoran desert at the junction of Mexico and USA. Since the discovery of the fine properties of jojoba, has been successfully introduced into tropical and subtropical regions of many other countries, such as Australia, India, Egypt and China [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although Jojoba has high tolerance to drought and high temperature, it is sensitive to cold stress. Hindered by the low tolerance to low temperature stress, jojoba is difficult to grow in temperate zones. Especially, although jojoba has been successfully introduced in parts of Yunnan and Sichuan province, China, many introduction studies in temperate regions of China like Henan province have failed [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is necessary to analyze the physiological and biochemical response of jojoba to the cold stress and to investigate the response of jojoba to cold stress at the molecular level.</p><p>Low temperature is one of the key environmental cues that negatively affect plant growth and development and limit the geographic distribution area of plants. To understand the plant response to low temperature stress, researchers have conducted a number of physiological, biochemical and molecular biological studies [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Through these results, we learned that, upon perception of the low temperature signal in plants, the stress signal is transmitted downstream to activate many transcription factors mediating stress tolerance and modulate the expression levels of many cold-responsive genes, finally leading to adjustment of a large number of biological processes, including photosynthesis, signaling, transcription, metabolism, cell wall modification and stress response [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, most of the studies on plant responses to cold stress were conducted in model plants and common crops such as Arabidopsis [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], rice [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and wheat [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], no systematic analysis of the cold stress response in jojoba was reported by far, despite its importance as a unique semi-arid, oil-producing industrial crop.</p><p>Since proteins are the key players in the majority of cellular biological processes, proteomics techniques have been the powerful tools for detection of the quantitative alterations in protein abundance in plant response to environmental stress. The classical proteomics approach was two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) identification. With the rapid development of quantitative MS, the gel-based proteomic techniques are gradually giving way to some newly-developed technologies, for example, stable isotope labeled quantitative proteomics methods such as the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling technique. iTRAQ coupled to liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) represents an efficient proteomic approach for the fast identification and accurate quantification of the high complexity protein mixture [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and is currently being widely used for the quantitative comparative analysis of plant proteomes to various environmental stresses [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the physiological and proteomic responses of jojoba to cold stress were investigated using iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS technique. This study will reveal how leaf proteins and their related pathways were regulated for jojoba&#x02019;s response to cold stress, our study can also identify the candidate proteins which play key role in cold acclimation in jojoba seedlings, which should facilitate the understanding of the low temperature stress response in jojoba at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-20-00243"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-20-00243"><title>2.1. Physiological Response of Jojoba Seedlings to Cold Stress</title><p>To investigate the physiological changes in jojoba leaves exposed to cold condition, the jojoba seedlings were treated with non-lethal cold treatment and several physiological and biochemical parameters were measured. Firstly, as expected, the physiological status of the jojoba was affected by cold stress and after cold treatment, the color of jojoba leaves changed from green to gray-green (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Figure S1</xref>). The retarded growth typically induced by cold stress might be associated to the impaired photosynthesis in jojoba seedlings under cold stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and change of leaf color may result from the decreased chlorophyll content in jojoba leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>a).</p><p>Cold stress is expected to promote the membrane peroxidation, resulting in the elevated level of plasma membrane permeability. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and relative electrolyte leakage (REL) can be used to evaluate the plasma membrane lipid peroxidation and integrity, respectively. In the present study, both MDA content and REL level in jojoba leaves were increased significantly under cold stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c), indicating that the treatment regimen we used caused plasma membrane damage in jojoba leaf. Osmotic homeostasis may be disturbed under cold stress and we determined the cold stress induced changes in soluble sugars and proline in jojoba leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>d,e). The levels of soluble sugars and proline were increased significantly under cold stress. We speculated that the accumulation of soluble sugars and proline in jojoba leaves probably help to maintain osmotic balance during adaptation to the cold stress.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) always accumulated in stressed plants and the activities of antioxidant enzymes will be regulated correspondingly. In cold-stressed jojoba leaves, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>f,g) and these antioxidant enzymes probably contribute to ROS scavenging in cold-stressed jojoba leaves. In addition, the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), a key enzyme catalyzes the first metabolic step from primary metabolism to the secondary phenylpropanoid metabolism, was observed to up-regulated in cold-stressed jojoba leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>h).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-00243"><title>2.2. iTRAQ Analysis and Identification of Differentially Accumulated Proteins</title><p>To investigate the proteomic changes associated with cold stress exposure in leaves of jojoba seedlings, iTRAQ analysis was conducted to identify the differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) between the control and cold-treated plants. High-resolution LC&#x02013;MS/MS was employed to detect and quantitate proteins in the jojoba leaves. The protein concentration of protein samples was measured by BCA method and the quality of each protein samples were evaluated by (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) SDS-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>After labeling, the combined iTRAQ labeled peptides were fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Figure S3</xref>). The mass spectrometry proteomic data of the present study have been deposited in the PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database under the database identifier PXD007063.</p><p>A total of 23,422 unique peptides (FDR &#x02264; 0.01) were obtained and 2821 proteins were ultimately identified. The distribution of peptide number is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f003">Figure 3</xref>a and all of the identified proteins having at least two peptides. The predicted molecular weights and isoelectric points (pIs) of the various identified proteins also showed high degrees of variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c), with molecular weights ranging from 10.3 to 254.6 kDa with a median of 37.8 kDa and pIs ranging from 3.95 to 12.06 with a median of 6.98. Moreover, most of the identified proteins have good peptide coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f003">Figure 3</xref>d).</p><p>Of all the detected proteins, 2821 appear in each replicate of all samples and the relative quantifications of these proteins were used for further analyses. Statistical t-test analysis was used to identify the candidate proteins that are involved in the cold stress response in jojoba leaves. Of the 2821 proteins that were quantitated, a total of 109 unique proteins showed differential accumulation pattern (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Table S2</xref>). Among these DAPs, 31 were up-regulated under cold stress, while the other 78 DAPs were down-regulated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-20-00243"><title>2.3. Functional Annotation and Classification of the Differentially Accumulated Proteins</title><p>To understand the biological roles of the DAPs in response to cold stress in jojoba leaves, we annotated the DAPs by the enrichment analysis in the Gene Ontology (GO) function term and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of the 109 DAPs were extracted from customized jojoba protein database based on their ID, then blastp algorithm was performed against the GO and KEGG databases. A total of 1215 GO terms and 38 KEGG terms were identified with a <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05. The top 3 categories of Biological Process terms were metabolic process, cellular process and single-organism process, the top 3 class of cellular component terms were cell, cell part and organelle and the top 3 categories of molecular function terms were catalytic activity, binding and structural molecule activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The major KEGG pathways included biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (9 DAPs), Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms (6 DAPs), phagosome (7 DAPs), Ribosome (5 DAPs), oxidative phosphorylation (4 DAPs), protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (3 DAPs) and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (3 DAPs).</p><p>GO enrichment analyses of the DAPs using agriGO [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] revealed 57 enriched GO terms. These enriched GO terms were associated with various biological processes, including response to abiotic stimulus, phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process and carbohydrate metabolic process. The overrepresented GO cellular component terms included cytoplasm, chloroplast and ribosome. The top 3 enriched GO molecular function terms were catalytic activity, lyase activity and structural molecule activity.</p><p>Although GO and KEGG analysis can provide similar and overlapping results, integrating these results will help to reveal more accurately the biological processes represented by the DAPs and their biological significance. All DAPs were also annotated by aligning to Arabidopsis protein database (TAIR10) and Swiss-Prot database. Based on the annotation results, together with results of the GO and KEGG analyses, the DAPs were classified into 14 categories according to their putative biological functions, i.e., photosynthesis, cytoskeleton and cell wall, protein synthesis, folding and degradation, lipid metabolism and transport, stress response and defense, signal transduction, RNA splicing and transport, vesicle transport, carbohydrate metabolism, transmembrane transport, ROS scavenging, secondary metabolism and miscellaneous and unknown proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Table S2</xref>). Their possible functions in cold stress signaling and response will be discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-20-00243"><title>2.4. Gene Expression Analysis of the Cold Stress Responsive Proteins</title><p>To validate the results of the quantitative proteomic analysis, 7 DAP coding genes were randomly selected for quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The expression levels of most of these genes exhibited the same trend with the protein abundance of the corresponding DAPs. However, the expression level of two genes (c89788_g1 and c75260_g1) showed the opposite change pattern with the abundance of their corresponding proteins. The discrepancy between the transcription level of the DAPs and the abundance of the corresponding proteins have been reported in previous studies [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and this difference probably resulted from posttranslational modifications of proteins under cold stress, such as protein phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-20-00243"><title>2.5. Molecular Network Involved in Cold Stress Response in Jojoba Leaves</title><p>To reveal the interaction networks associated with the cold stress response in jojoba leaves, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using the STRING protein-protein interaction database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Due to the lack of protein interaction data of jojoba and its closely related species, we used the homologous proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to construct the protein interaction networks. For ease of understanding, the names of the DAPs were represented by the names or the locus numbers of the homologous proteins in Arabidopsis (<uri xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org">http://www.arabidopsis.org</uri>) in the PPI map.</p><p>The largest network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>a) consists of 11 DAPs associated with proteins synthesis and folding, suggesting the cold stress significantly affected the protein synthesis in jojoba. The second largest network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>b) consisted of 4 proteins and most of them were related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The other subnetworks were associated with photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>c), cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>d) and transmembrane transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>e). In sum, most of the cold stress-regulated biological processes identified via functional annotation and classification analyses were also highlighted in the PPI map.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-20-00243"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Our previous EST analysis had identified several candidate genes which may be involved in the water-deficient stress response in jojoba plants [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present proteomic analysis, a large number of cold stress-responsive proteins were identified in jojoba leaves. As expected, some well-known stress-inducible proteins were found, such as copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (CSD1) and cold-regulated 47 (COR47). Some cold-responsive proteins reported previously in other plant species were also presented in the list of the DAPs, including ferredoxin 3 (FD3) and PHE ammonia lyase 1 (PAL1) [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results support the reliability and robustness of the iTRAQ technology in investigating the plant response to environmental stress. Our data showed that several proteins were up-regulated significantly under cold stress and some of them might play important roles in the response to cold stress in jojoba. The possible biological functions of these DAPs in cold stress adaptation are further discussed below.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijms-20-00243"><title>3.1. Proteins Involved in Stress Signal Transduction</title><p>In plant cells, perception of extracellular stimuli was mediated by the plasma membrane receptors and transduced by signaling pathway. In the present study, several components in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling were regulated under cold stress, highlighting their pivotal roles in the jojoba&#x02019;s response to cold stress.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an essential role in plant cells in response to environmental stimuli as a second messenger and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration has been found to increase in response to cold stress [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our study, two calcium-binding proteins, i.e., calcium-binding EF-hand family protein and annexin 4, were found to be down-regulated under cold stress. Although calcium ion has been demonstrated to play an important role in the low temperature perception and signaling, in the present study, we can still find some components of calcium signaling pathway changes in abundance after 7 days of cold stress, indicating that the calcium ion signaling pathway may also be involved in low temperature adaptation in jojoba.</p><p>ABA signaling plays important role in stress response in plant and as expected, several DAPs involved ABA signaling were identified, including Serine/threonine-protein kinase GRIK2 (GRIK2), CPCK2 (chloroplast localized subunit of casein kinase 4) and annexin 4. SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1.1 (SnRK1.1) is a key component in abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway and Arabidopsis GRIK1 specifically activates SnRK1.1 by phosphorylation of its activation-loop [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Annexin 4 has been shown to play a vital role in abscisic acid signal transduction in Arabidopsis in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition, several DAPs involved synthesis and signaling of other phytohormones were also identified. Of them, ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) is an enzyme involved in the ethylene biosynthesis and EXORDIUM like 5 (EXL5) is involved in brassinosteroid-dependent regulation of growth and development [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These data indicated that multiple phytohormone signaling pathways were adjusted in jojoba to adapt to the cold condition.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-ijms-20-00243"><title>3.2. Proteins Involved in Photosynthesis and Carbohydrate Metabolism</title><p>Photosynthesis is greatly inhibited by low temperature in various plant species, especially for cold sensitive tropical crops such as jojoba. We observed that the physiological status of jojoba seedlings was affected by the cold stress treatment. The effect might relate to the decrease of the net photosynthesis as revealed by photosynthetic performance measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Sixteen DAPs involved in photosynthesis were regulated by cold stress. In line with the impaired photosynthesis, most of the photosynthesis related DAPs were down-regulated in abundance, including three ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain proteins and a Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase. The only three up-regulated DAPs were FD3, NADP-malic enzyme 4 (NADP-ME4) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of plastid 1 (GAPCP-1). Ferredoxins are small, soluble iron-sulfur proteins that deliver electrons in many metabolic reactions and the chloroplast localized ferredoxins mainly function as electron transfer proteins to transfer reducing equivalents from photosystem I (PSI) to NADPH during linear electron flow (LEF). Ferredoxins were down or up-regulated under abiotic stress in several plant species such as rice and maize [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and expression of a sweet pepper ferredoxin enhanced the tolerance to heat stress in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, the up-regulation of FD3 may help to prevent photo-oxidative damage under cold stress through cyclic electron flow (CEF) in jojoba leaves.</p><p>We observed significant increase in soluble sugars and proline level in jojoba leaves under cold stress. These molecules not only function as osmoprotectants but also protect the membrane via the interaction with the lipid biolayer and high levels of sugars inhibit photosynthesis in plant under cold stress [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Considered that the photosynthesis is greatly inhibited by cold stress, the accumulation of soluble sugars probably resulted from enhanced starch degradation, which was consistent with observations in tea plant [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As expected, many enzymes affecting sugar content were regulated under cold stress and these enzymes included a trehalose-6-phosphatase synthase s7, which is involved in trehalose biosynthesis [<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and two enzymes involved in starch synthesis, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase family protein (AGPase large subunit 3, APL3) and granule bound starch synthase 1) (GBSS1) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00243">Table S2</xref>). ADP-Glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes the rate limiting step in starch biosynthesis and AGPase large subunit 1 (APL1) and AGPase small subunit (APS1) are abundant in photosynthetic tissues and play the dominant role in leaves. APL3 is a large subunit isoform of AGP and present mainly in root [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The up-regulation of APL3 in cold-stressed jojoba leaves suggested that APL3 might also play a role in starch synthesis in leaves when the plants were exposed to cold stress. GBSS1 is the only starch synthase isoform required for amylose synthesis in chloroplast [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the up-regulation of GBSS1 in cold-stressed jojoba indicates that the proportion of amylose in starch may increase in cold-stressed jojoba leaves. In brief, our data showed that reorganization of starch metabolism was an essential process for jojoba to survive under low temperature conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-ijms-20-00243"><title>3.3. Proteins Involved in ROS Scavenging</title><p>Dysfunction of the photosynthetic apparatus under cold conditions exposes the plant to photoinhibition and can lead to elevated levels of ROS. In the present study, 6 DAPs involved in ROS scavenging were identified. Glutathione (GSH) plays key role in cell redox homeostasis. Three of these DAPs were involved in regulating GSH concentration, including GLYOXALASEI 6 (GLYI6) and two glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase family proteins. These results indicated that GSH metabolism was adjusted in jojoba leaf cells upon cold stress. Among these DAPs, glyoxalase Is (GLYIs) are one of the two groups of enzymes forming glyoxalase pathway and glyoxalase pathway has been shown to play an important role in stress tolerance. GLYI uses GSH as a cofactor for the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), high level of which is toxic to cells [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>CSD1 were found to be up-regulated significantly in jojoba leaves under cold stress. In line with the change in protein abundance, the superoxide dismutase activity was elevated in cold stress jojoba leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>f). CSD1 encodes a cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and its expression is negatively regulated by miR398. SODs catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, constitute the first line of defense against ROS in cell.

Proteins Involved in Stress Response and Defense</title><p>Eight proteins involved in stress response and defense were identified as DAPs in the present study. Several proteins of these category, i.e., COR47, cystatin B, ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA KUNITZ TRYPSIN INHIBITOR 5 (ATKTI5), MLP-like protein 34 (MLP34), were frequently identified as differentially accumulated proteins under stressful conditions in previous proteomic studies in other plant species [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>It is noteworthy that almost all DAPs involved in stress response and defense were down-regulated under cold stress in jojoba leaves and the only cold-induced DAPs in this category is COR47. Dehydrin (DHN) is a large family of proteins present in plants and DHNs are produced in response to environmental stresses. COR47 is one of DHNs that accumulate during the abiotic stress such as drought, salinity, freezing, or by treatment with ABA. COR47 is one the principal DHNs that accumulate under low temperature stress in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and overexpression of COR47 improved cold stress tolerance of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedling [<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. COR47 is regarded as the marker genes of CBF/DREB pathway during cold acclimation, thus the up-regulation of COR47 under cold exposure probably play important role in cold adaptation of jojoba seedlings.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-ijms-20-00243"><title>3.5. Proteins Involved in Cell Wall Modification and Osmotic Homeostasis</title><p>Cold stress was previously reported to affect the cell walls in pea seedlings [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and cell wall modification is essential for plant acclimation to environmental stresses [<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As expected, several enzymes involved in cell wall modification were differentially accumulated in cold-stressed jojoba leaves. Among these DAPs, pectin methylesterase CGR2 (CGR2) functions in the modification of cell walls via methylesterification of cell wall pectin [<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Lignin is an important component of cell walls and several genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, i.e., PAL1, CCR (cinnamoyl CoA: NADP oxidoreductase)-LIKE 1 and a class III peroxidases, peroxidase 52, were identified as DAPs, indicating lignin synthesis was regulated under cold stress. Among these DAPs, PAL1 was up-regulated significantly and the PAL enzyme activity measurement validated the up-regulation of PAL at the protein level. PAL1 catalyzes the first step in the phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and another important enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, flavonol synthase 1 (FLS1) was also up-regulated in cold-stressed jojoba leaves. In addition to act as the precursors for lignin synthesis, derivatives of phenylpropanoid pathway have various biological functions in plants, for example, some flavonoids function as protectants against oxidative stress induced by abiotic stress or pathogen attack [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Cold stress can induce inhibition of water uptake and indirectly resulted in osmotic stress in cells [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], thus, maintenance of the cell&#x02019;s osmotic potential under cold conditions is one of the major challenges for plant growth and development. In the present study, the increased soluble sugars in cold-stressed jojoba leaves can help the cell to lower water potential in cytoplasmic matric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f002">Figure 2</xref>d). At the same time, several aquaporins and ion transporters were found to be differentially accumulated under cold stress and these DAPs included plasma membrane intrinsic protein 3 (PIP3), inorganic H pyrophosphatase family protein AVP1 (AVP1) and PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTON ATPASE 2 (PMA2). Of these DAPs, PMA2 probably contributes to the H<sup>+</sup>-electrochemical potential difference across cytoplasma membrane that drives the active transport of nutrients by H<sup>+</sup>-symport and PMA2 is also shown to be involved in cell expansion, by acidifying the apoplasm and thus, activating proteins involved in loosening the cell wall like expansins [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the present study, the decreased PMA2 may be associated to the cell wall rigidification induced by cold stress [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. AVP1 plays an important role in trans-tonoplast membrane proton gradient that is used to energize secondary transporters like vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters and ectopic expression of an Arabidopsis AVP1 improves drought- and salt tolerance in cotton [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The up-regulation of AVP1 in cold-stressed jojoba leaves might contribute to the osmotic homeostasis of the cells.</p><p>Under the low temperature environment, the cell volume might become smaller. To cope with such stress, the cytoskeleton, cell wall and plasma membrane would change correspondingly. We found five cytoskeleton-related proteins differentially accumulated under cold stress. These DAPs included tubulin alpha-4 chain (TUA4), tubulin beta 8 (TUB8) and actin 1 (ACT1). The cytoskeleton-related DAPs probably participate in modulating the cytoskeleton organization in cold-stressed jojoba leaf cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-ijms-20-00243"><title>3.6.

In jojoba, 11 DAPs involved in protein metabolism were identified, including 6 involved in translation, 3 in protein folding and 2 in protein modification. Extensive protein interactions were predicted among the DAPs in this category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00243-f007">Figure 7</xref>a).</p><p>Although most of the DAPs involved in protein metabolism were down-regulated, some of them were induced under cold stress. For example, 60S ribosomal protein L7-3 and L10a-1 and an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) subunit were down-regulated, while 60S ribosomal protein L7-4 and L13a-2 were increased in abundance under cold stress. These data indicated that the translation apparatus was adjusted to adapt to cold environment.</p><p>Besides 60S ribosomal protein L7-4 and L13a-2, two cold-induced DAPs, i.e., signal peptidase complex catalytic subunit SEC11C (SEC11C) and staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3-like a (STT3A), were identified in jojoba leaves under cold stress. Signal peptidase is a group of enzymes help to remove signal peptides from nascent proteins Since no stress responsive signal peptidase have been reported by now, the biological significance of the up-regulation of SEC11C observed in the present study is still to be investigated.</p><p>Environmental stresses often lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. Besides molecular chaperone and peptide disulfide isomerase, which help the refolding of the misfolded proteins, <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in ER has been shown to regulate protein quality control. Protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in ER is catalyzed by a multi-subunit enzyme, the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. One of the cold-induce DAPs in the present study, STT3A, is one of the catalytic subunits of OST. Previous studies showed that STT3a is required for recovery from the unfolded protein response and for cell during salt/osmotic stress recovery [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

In the present study, 10 DAPs involved in fatty acid metabolism and transport were identified, indicating a significant change were taken place in lipid metabolism in cold-stressed jojoba leaves and such a phenomenon was reported in Arabidopsis and <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. There of these DAPs, i.e., glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid protein transfer 6 (LTPG6), fatty acid export 1 (FAX1) and ROSY1 are involved in lipid and sterol transfer. Among them, ROSY1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of gravitropic response and basipetal auxin transport in roots [<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and the down-regulation of ROSY1 in jojoba leaves suggested its possible role in cold stress response. The remaining 8 DAPs in this category were mainly associated with lipid synthesis and catabolism. Among them, 3-DEOXY-D-ARABINO-HEPTULOSONATE-7-PHOSPHATE 2 (DAHP2) catalyzes the first step of the shikimate pathway, a key pathway for the synthesis of aromatic primary and secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The up-regulation of DAHP2 in cold-stressed jojoba leaves indicated that more carbon flux was used to synthesize lipid and secondary metabolites. Mitochondrial acyl carrier protein 1 (MTACP-1), a member of the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) family, is involved in fatty acid and lipoic acid synthesis in mitochondria [<xref rid="B45-ijms-20-00243" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
