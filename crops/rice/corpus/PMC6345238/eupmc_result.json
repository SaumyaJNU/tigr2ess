    "Lodging in crops seriously restricts plant growth and grain production. The genetic modification of cell walls to enhance plant mechanical strength has been suggested as a promising approach toward improving lodging resistance. However, because of the complexity of the plant cell wall, the exact effects of its polymers on plant lodging resistance remain elusive. To address this issue, we performed large-scale analyses of a total of 56 rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties that displayed distinct cell wall component and lodging index. Lignin was identified as the key cell wall polymer that positively determines lodging resistance in rice. Correlation analysis between cell wall composition and plant morphological characteristics revealed that lignin enhanced rice lodging resistance by largely increasing the mechanical strength of the basal stem and reducing plant height. Further characterization of four representative rice varieties, ShenNong9903, YanJian218, KongYu131, and ShenNongK33, displaying varied levels of lodging resistance, revealed the multiple candidate genes (PAL, CoMT, 4CL3, CAD2, CAD7 and CCR20) responsible for increasing lignin level. Hence, our results demonstrate that the high lignin level in the cell wall predominately improves lodging resistance and suggest target genes for the genetic modification of lignin towards breeding rice with high lodging resistance."
