The primary defence system is that plants respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), a process termed PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). PTI causes rapid defence reactions, such as ion fluxes, cell wall reinforcement, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of defence-related genes (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Zipfel, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, successful pathogens can interfere with PTI by delivering effectors, evading recognition, or suppressing signalling pathways. In turn, the hosts use resistance proteins to recognize the effectors, leading to the secondary defence system of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Zipfel, 2008</xref>). ETI commonly results in local cell death, known as the hypersensitive response (HR).</p><p>During the recognition of pathogens, most of the inducible defence-related proteins are associated with pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs), which have been divided into 17 families and play important roles in plant defence systems (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">van Loon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Of these, the PR5 family proteins, which are also referred to as thaumatin-like proteins, have been reported in many species upon infection with pathogens and have been associated with antimicrobial activity. Some PR5s have been shown to have antifungal activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Abad <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Pressey, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Min <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tjamos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">van Loon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The tobacco PR5 protein osmotin is inducible by both osmotic stress and pathogens, and its homologs in tomato and potato have been shown to possess anti-oomycete activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>, and overexpression of tobacco PR5 in tobacco and potato plants can enhance disease resistance against this pathogen. ATLP3, a PR5 protein identified from Arabidopsis, displays <italic>in vitro</italic> antifungal activity against <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, <italic>V. alboatrum</italic>, and <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Reddy, 1997</xref>). Overexpression of a rice thaumatin-like protein results in an enhanced resistance to <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> in tobacco (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Velazhahan and Muthukrishnan, 2004</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic>, which is the causal agent of cotton wilt disease, is a pathogenic fungus with a very wide host range of over 200 dicotyledonous plant species (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Fradin and Thomma, 2006</xref>). It produces various effector molecules to modulate its infection, although not much is known regarding the components that are crucial for its pathogenicity. In general, cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), toxins, and elicitor-like molecules have been the focus of most studies. <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> secretes CWDEs that act as a virulence factor in its interactions with plants, among which pectinolytic enzymes are the best-characterized and are thought to have important roles in pathogenicity (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Dobinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Some of these enzymes have been shown to cause wilt symptoms and promote the necrosis of plant tissues (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Cooper and Wood, 1980</xref>). In a recent study, a <italic>V. dahliae</italic> pectate lyase, VdPEL1, was shown to induce plant cell death and contribute to virulence (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Several CWDEs, such as ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Enkerli <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) and xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase (XEG1) (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), have also been recognized as PAMPs. In addition, <italic>V. dahliae</italic> produces phytotoxins and elicitor proteins that induce host cell death (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Pegg, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), suggesting that they may also be associated with pathogenicity. A high-molecular-weight protein&#x02013;lipopolysaccharide (PLP) complex has been reported to be associated with disease symptoms in susceptible host plants and to be required for pathogenicity (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Buchner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>). Furthermore, many elicitor-like proteins isolated from <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, such as PevD1 (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), VdCP1 (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2017), and VdNEP (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), can induce plant defence responses and cell death.</p><p>The Alt a 1 family of proteins (AA1s; Pfam family PF16541) are only present in the Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes classes of fungi (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Chruszcz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The AA1 produced by the first member &#x02018;Alt a 1 (Aa1)&#x02019;, identified from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>alternata</italic>, is the source of the name of this protein family (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Cramer and Lawrence, 2003</xref>). Studies have shown that Aa1 is involved in <italic>Alternaria</italic> spore germination and that it is localized exclusively in the spore cell wall (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mitakakis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Twaroch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Alt b 1 (Ab1), a homolog of Aa1, has been identified from <italic>A. brassicicola</italic>. High expression of <italic>Ab1</italic> mRNA has been detected during the infection process of Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cramer and Lawrence, 2004</xref>). An AA1 member from <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> has been demonstrated to bind to the plant plasma membrane and to induce necrosis, the accumulation of ROS, and the expression of several defence-related genes, suggesting that it has a PAMP role (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>b</italic></xref>). To date, numerous <italic>AA1</italic> genes have been identified from over 70 species, although the biological functions of AA1 proteins with respect to plant&#x02013;fungal interactions remain unclear.</p><p>PevD1 has previously been isolated from <italic>V. dahliae</italic> culture filtrates and shown to exhibit an elicitor-like activity by inducing defence responses in tobacco plants (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). PevD1-induced disease resistance in tobacco has been demonstrated to be modulated by an asparagine-rich protein, NbNRP1 (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of PevD1 in Arabidopsis has been reported to promote early flowering by interacting with AtNRP1 and plants infected with <italic>V. dahliae</italic> flower earlier than uninfected plants (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), implying that PevD1 has a role in mediating plant development during <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection. However, even though it is one of the most abundant proteins among the many secreted by <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, the biological role of PevD1 in the infection process, and particularly its possible function in pathogenicity, remains unclear. In this study, we determined that PevD1 is an Aa1-like protein, and an interacting protein named GhPR5 was identified from cotton plants. Our findings show that <italic>V. dahliae</italic> secretes PevD1 to inhibit the antifungal activity of GhPR5 as a strategy to resist the plant defence system and to promote fungal infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material, culturing of strains, inoculation, and pathogenicity assays</title><p>Plants of cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>), and tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) were grown as previously described (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000ed;as <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).

For each strain, conidial suspensions at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> in sterile water were prepared. Plant seedlings were grown in soil in individual pots, and 15 pots were prepared for each strain, with this set-up replicated three times. Samples of the conidial suspension (15 ml) were aliquoted into 15 separate trays, and each pot was placed in a tray until complete absorption of the liquid had occurred. The inoculated seedlings were then grown for 2&#x02013;3 weeks at 28 &#x000b0;C, with a day/night period of 16/8 h, and disease symptoms were observed at 21 d post-inoculation on cotton or 15 d post-inoculation on tobacco and tomato. Vascular discoloration was observed by cutting the shoots at 21 d post-inoculation on cotton. For fungal biomass quantification, roots of three inoculated plants were harvested at 21 d after inoculation and ground to powder for genomic DNA extraction. The fungal biomass was determined by qPCR as described previously (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), with three biological replicates, and triplicate reactions were performed for each of the biological replicates. <italic>Verticillium</italic> EF-1&#x003b1; was used to quantify fungal colonization, and the cotton <italic>18S</italic> gene served as the internal control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Table S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Roots of host plants (2-week-old cotton and 4-week-old Arabidopsis, tobacco, and tomato) were inoculated with a spore suspension as described above.

Our previous studies indicated that PevD1 could induce plant defence responses (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and interact with NRP1 proteins, which mediated early flowering in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and disease resistance in tobacco (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Liang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). As the only Aa1-like protein in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, the pathogenic function of PevD1 during infection has remained elusive. In the present study, we first found that PevD1 contributes to <italic>V. dahliae</italic> pathogenicity in cotton via its interaction with the protein GhPR5. The mRNA levels of <italic>pevd1</italic> showed up-regulation during the early stages of infection in a variety of hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Although the phenotypes of the <italic>&#x00394;pevd1</italic> strains were not discernibly different from those of the WT strain with respect to their growth rate, sporulation capacity, and mycelium/spore morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D&#x02013;F</xref>), they displayed significant decreases in their virulence against hosts, and complementation of <italic>pevd1</italic> resulted in restoration of virulence to the levels observed for the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). To date, few studies have investigated whether AA1 family proteins have roles in plant pathogenesis. <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Mitakakis <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> showed that high amounts of Aa1 are released in germinating compared to ungerminated conidia, corresponding to our qPCR results for <italic>pevd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data suggest that PevD1 plays an important role in the pathogenicity of <italic>V. dahliae</italic>.</p><p>We formed a hypothesis that PevD1 can act as an effector to contribute to <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection, and thus we attempted to identify the interacting protein partner of PevD1 in cotton using pull-down assays. A PR5-like protein was isolated and was designated as GhPR5. Many investigations have shown that PR5s can be induced by pathogen attacks (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anil Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). One of the best-characterized properties of PR5s is their antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of organisms, including <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, <italic>P. infestans</italic>, <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, <italic>V. alboatrum</italic>, and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, and overexpressing a PR5-like protein in plants can enhance their resistance to pathogenic fungi (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anil Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). AtPR5 in Arabidopsis has been reported to show a stronger induction after inoculation with <italic>V. dahliae</italic> and is considered as a determinant of resistance (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Tjamos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In our present study, the results showed that GhPR5 was markedly induced by <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>) and possessed anti-fungal activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Several PR5 proteins with antifungal activity have been reported to exhibit &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase activity (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Grenier <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Menu-Bouaouiche, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">van Loon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), although there is no clear evidence regarding the correlation between the two activities. Whether GhPR5 possesses &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase activity requires further investigation.</p><p>Chitinase is a PR protein produced in plant cells after a pathogen infection (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">van Loon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and it is able to degrade fungal cell walls into chitin oligomers that can be recognized by plant cell LysM receptors (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Miya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), thus triggering the plant immunity system and protecting them from infection. Two cerato-platanin family proteins from <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>V. dahliae</italic> have been observed to bind to chitin and to protect cell wall polysaccharides from chitinase degradation (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Quarantin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>a</italic></xref>). MoHrip1 and Aa1, homologs of PevD1, have been shown to partially localize to the cell wall (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Twaroch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017<italic>b</italic></xref>), and therefore we suggest that PevD1 may become enriched in cell walls to protect them from being degraded by GhPR5. As shown in the present study, GhPR5 was more active against <italic>&#x00394;pevd1</italic> mutants than against the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), and the anti-<italic>V. dahliae</italic> activity of GhPR5 was decreased <italic>in vitro</italic> by the addition of PevD1, which corresponded to the results of assays showing that PevD1 contributed to virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Fungal cell walls contain a crucial &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan structural component (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Fesel and Zuccaro, 2016</xref>) that can act as an elicitor of plant immune responses, including SA-dependent defence (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Klarzynski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). PevD1 may contribute to virulence by protecting the cell wall, thus allowing fungal growth to be maintained and preventing the recognition of degraded &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan by the plant.</p><p>PR5s have been shown to be common host proteins involved in defence responses and possess antifungal activity against many plant pathogens. In addition to PevD1, several effectors have been previously described to interact with PR5s, such as BEC1054 from <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Pennington <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and BcIEB1 from <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>); thus, PR5s may be targets to be attacked by pathogens. Although BcIEB1 can cause necrosis in tobacco (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000ed;as <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), its activity is disrupted by osmotin (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In our study, the PevD1&#x02013;GhPR5 interaction resulted in a decrease in the antifungal activity of GhPR5 in cotton and promoted <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Both PevD1 and a PevD1&#x02013;GhPR5 mixture could induce an equal level of necrosis in cotton and tobacco leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), suggesting that PevD1 has complicated pathogenic roles in the infection process. In general, necrosis-inducing proteins act as virulence factors during the pathogen infection process, especially for necrotrophic fungi (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#x000ed;as <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The contribution of necrosis-inducing proteins to the virulence of necrotrophic fungi is believed to be through their ability to provide nutrients for fungal growth (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Govrin and Levine, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Choquer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> is a hemibiotrophic fungus that produces a number of effectors that are secreted during infection to destroy plant cells (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Fradin and Thomma, 2006</xref>). PevD1 was expressed at high levels from early infection onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that it has important roles throughout the infection process, especially in the later stages. Furthermore, PevD1 induced plant cell death in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>), and it may play a phytotoxic role and promote <italic>V. dahliae</italic> infection by its accumulation during the late stages of infection. In summary, we suggest that the contribution of PevD1 to virulence in cotton occurs through its interaction with GhPR5 and its induction of plant cell death, which inhibit the antifungal activity of GhPR5 and provide nutrients for disease development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). Our results provide important insights into the strategies used by <italic>V. dahliae</italic> to infect hosts.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Proposed model of PevD1 function during <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic>&#x02013;host interaction.

Secretion of PevD1 leads to an interaction with GhPR5 and protects the fungus against its antifungal activity.
