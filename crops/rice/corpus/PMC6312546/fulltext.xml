Using multi-sgRNAs to target one or more genes is helpful to improve the efficacy of gene editing and facilitate multi-gene editing. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 system which can be conveniently developed as a CRISPR kit. SgRNA expression cassettes can be rapidly generated by one-step PCR using our CRISPR kit. In our kit, there are two binary vectors pHNCas9 and pHNCas9HT. The binary vector pHNCas9 was constructed to allow to assemble up to eight sgRNA expression cassettes by one-step Golden Gate cloning. Another binary vector pHNCas9HT can be used to generate a large number of single target constructs by directly transforming ligation reactions products into <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> without several procedures, such as PCR and plasmid extraction. The two binary vectors are designed according to the principles of standard BioBrick assembly to be used as an open-source tool. For example, we used BioBrick as a visual T-DNA tag. We also developed a primer design aid to complement the system. With this primer design aid, researchers can rapidly obtain primers and GC content, and sgRNA sequence of target site. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system can perform single- and multi-site editing and multiple gene editing to produce various types of mutations in tomato. This rapid and user-friendly CRISPR/Cas9 system for tomato can be potentially used for mutagenesis of important crop species for genetic improvement and is suitable for research into the function of genes.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Genetic engineering: Quick and easy CRISPR in tomato</title><p id="Par2">Researchers in China have created a toolkit to easily mutate genes in tomato using the CRISPR gene modification technology. Zhengguo Li of Chongqing University developed the system in response to the lack of an open, standardized, reliable gene editing tool in tomato. The toolkit is designed according to an open-source, modular standard known as Biobrick. It consists of several molecular building blocks which can be used to target up to eight genes for editing or deletion. The kit also includes software to help researchers determine the DNA sequences necessary to copy genes of interest and prepare them for the CRISPR reactions. Li&#x02019;s team tested the toolkit by using it to successfully simultaneously mutate multiple genes involved in tomato ripening. The new toolkit will enable researchers to rapidly and easily manipulate genes in this important crop.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31572175</award-id><award-id>31401924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Reverse genetics is a fundamental way of studying gene function in plants, where a gene of interest is knocked out or its expression is attenuated to deduce the normal function of the gene from the observed phenotypic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Classical reverse genetic strategies to target genes of interest include antisense inhibition, virus-induced gene silencing, and post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) based on double-stranded RNA, either driven by small interfering RNA or artificial micro RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A drawback of PTGS is its instability from tissue to tissue or generation to generation, as the small RNAs can also induce methylation of the DNA inserted in transcriptional units of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Naturally occurring or induced mutations or T-DNA insertions can be informative about gene function research in model species. For example, the vast pools of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> T-DNA mutants have been generated and screened to identify the mutations in genes of interest when the gene sequences and T-DNA are known. However, this approach is not applicable in most plant species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Map-based cloning can be complex and difficult when genetic mutations are induced by ethyl methanesulfonate or fast neutrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Several genome editing systems are currently being used to circumvent these problems in a variety of organisms, including non-model plants. Over the past decade, two protein-based DNA targeting systems, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been utilized to perform site-directed changes in the genome. The RNA-guided genome editing system CRISPR/Cas9 system (type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein system) has recently revolutionized genetic research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These bacterial nucleases can recognize a specific DNA sequence and cleave it at the target site to generate double-strand breaks (DSBs). Two primary repair mechanisms, namely, homologous-directed repair (HDR) and error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), are available repairing for DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. When a DSB is repaired by the NHEJ pathway, various mistakes, such as small insertions and deletions, are often created in or near the target locus. Therefore, if NHEJ occurs in an open reading frame or regulatory motif, then the mutations may induce frameshifts or disrupt a regulatory motif. The HDR pathway faithfully inserts a donor DNA segment with a strongly homologous sequence in the targeted site and can be exploited to incorporate a mutation of interest.</p><p id="Par4">The versatility and efficiency of genome editing of CRISPR/Cas9 technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> render it suitable for crop breeding research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been deployed in a variety of important plant species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and is simpler, more efficient, and more flexible than ZFNs and TALENs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has three components: Cas9 protein and two short RNAs named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). CrRNA and tracrRNA have been shown to form an integrated RNA structure defined as guide RNA (gRNA), which contains 20 specific nucleotide sequences that bind to the target DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The protospacer adjacent motif, NGG, is located at 3&#x002b9; downstream of the target sequence and is necessary for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to recognize and cleave the target site to generate DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In animals, single-guide (sg) RNAs and <italic>Cas9</italic> mRNA can be co-injected into a one-cell embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, it is difficult to conduct this method in plant duo to the surrounding cell wall. Instead, an Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation method has been found to be suitable for delivering a T-DNA containing sgRNA&#x02013;Cas9 sequences into plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. One limitation of early CRISPR/Cas9 systems in plants is that they usually recognize only one or two target sites. However, it has been shown that targeting multiple sgRNAs to the same gene can considerably increase the editing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Combining multiple sgRNAs can also extend the usefulness of Cas9 as a mutagen by increasing the efficiency of deleting large segments of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Occasionally locating genome editing at different sites simultaneously is also desirable. Several multi-site CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been developed to achieve this phenomenon in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, for example, using Golden Gate, Gibson Assembly, or compatible enzymes for assembly of multiplex gRNA cassettes. Although these methods have been demonstrated, a variety of shortcomings still exist in such methods. Some methods can only assemble a few sgRNA expression cassettes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, while others require several steps of subcloning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The common shortcoming of these systems is the lack of standardization to support open-source adoption and development of tools.</p><p id="Par6">Tomato is an important horticultural crop. A CRISPR/Cas9 system can be a direct and efficient tool to generate new varieties without introducing foreign genes into the plant genome. These varieties can be used as non-transgenic germplasm resources, which might be acceptable if they are considered as non-transgenic crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Herein we introduced an open-source, developable, and modular system for plant genome engineering to facilitate gene function research in tomato and potentially in other crops. With the application of standardized BioBrick technology, our system can be easily upgraded and adjusted to accommodate novel expression elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. BioBrick technology is a synthetic biology technology based on the same-tail restriction enzyme. It allows BioBrick modules to be continuously assembled without damaging the BioBrick sites. A similar multipurpose open-source system was recently published by Cermak et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. They used Golden Gate cloning to assemble different functional modules for different applications. Differently from Cermak and colleagues, we used standardized BioBrick technology to achieve the similar purpose. We have developed a <italic>Cas9</italic> system containing two binary vectors pHNCas9 and pHNCas9HT. pHNCas9HT can be used for the construction of sgRNA expression cassettes without PCR and direct transformation of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>. Multiple sgRNA expression cassettes can be assembled into the pHNCas9 in one pot by Golden Gate ligation. Golden Gate ligation uses the type II restriction endonucleases, such as <italic>Esp3</italic> I and <italic>Bsa</italic> I, to design and generate non-palindromic sticky ends of sequences, which can avoid self-ligation and incompatible end ligation. Thus, this method is suitable for linking multiple DNA fragments in a single reaction in a designed order. Furthermore, our system can be easily developed into a rapid and user-friendly open-source CRISPR/Cas9 kit for single- or multi-site editing.</p><p id="Par7">We aimed to illustrate the potential use of a BioBrick by designing a visual T-DNA marker based on the overexpression of <italic>AtMYB75/PAP1</italic> (driven by 35S promoter)<italic>. AtMYB75-</italic>overexpressed lines exhibit purple stems, leaves, and flowers due to the abnormal accumulation of anthocyanins in these tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Using the genome editing system containing a visual marker, transformants can be easily screened by the plant color, which can indicate whether they possess the T-DNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 and the visual BioBrick insert in T0 and offspring. According to Mendelian genetics, heterozygous transgenic lines of the offspring undergo genetic separation. Therefore, we can screen for non-transgenic mutants (no T-DNA insertion and <italic>AtMYB75</italic> expression element) based on whether the plants indicate a purple color. We developed a primer design aid that contains macros and Visual Basic function for our CRISPR/Cas9 system using Microsoft Excel to further facilitate the uptake and use of the tomato genome editing system.

We tested off-target sites1 with the highest off-target score (0.468) by T7EI assay and monoclonal sequencing in T4 plant to determine whether off-target events can accumulate in the offspring.

In this section, we selected two genes as the target genes of our system, <italic>SlACS2</italic> and <italic>SlACS4</italic>, which are both involved in ethylene synthesis during the ripening of fruit. Two target sites (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) in the conserved region were also chosen due to the high homology between the two genes. Therefore, these target sites both target the two genes. The target site primers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) were designed with our primer design aid. AtU3b and AtU3d promoters were used for the two target sites. The sgRNA expression cassettes were amplified by one-step PCR in one pot using our CRISPR kit. We prepared pHNCas9:SlACS2&#x00026;4 construct by adopting the Golden Gate cloning strategies and then transformed tomato with this construct.</p><p id="Par36">We obtained nine T0 lines for these constructs.

However, only mutations in SlACS2&#x00026;4 target 2 were detected. This result implies that the mutation rate caused by the SlACS2&#x00026;4 target 1 is very low. The preceding findings proved that our CRISPR/Cas9 system can edit multiple genes in tomato.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Secondary structure of sgRNA affects the mutation efficiency of target sites</title><p id="Par37">In our study, we designed eight target sites (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for six genes, and our results show that their targeting efficiency is different.

Our system provides two binary vectors pHNCas9 and pHNCas9HT, five different Pol III-dependent promoters and sgRNA in pEASY clone vector, eight pairs <italic>Bsa</italic> I-site primer, and a gene-specific primer design aid. Our system is suitable for the preparation of a CRISPR kit. pHNCas9HT is suitable for rapid and low-cost generation of large-scale constructs for single-site editing without a considerable amount of work. The pHNCas9 was constructed to allow the assembly of up to eight sgRNA expression cassettes following the principles of one-pot Golden Gate cloning. Researchers can quickly design specific primers for pHNCas9HT or pHNCas9 by our primer design aid. Enriching the functionality of our CRISPR/Cas9 system is easy due to its compatibility. For example, the binary vector can accept additional multiple sgRNA expression cassette groups (up to four sgRNA expression cassettes can be contained), which can be created into a BioBrick by amplification using primers Bb-F and Bb-R.</p><p id="Par42">We show that our system can perform single- and multi-site editing and multi-gene editing in tomato. However, significant differences in mutation efficiency exist between different sgRNAs (containing target site) and different lines. This may be related to the following factors. First GC content of target site is reported to be important for the editing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and 97% of target site which have been experimentally validated in plants have a GC content between 30 and 80%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Second, the effect of regular site and irregular site for genome editing efficiency was weak as reported in previous reports. In our work, 8 target sites we selected included regular sites and irregular sites. Our results indicate that the sites with a higher mutation rate (<italic>SlGRAS8</italic> target 1, <italic>SlGRAS8</italic> target 2, <italic>SlACS2&#x00026;4</italic> target 2) contain the regular target and the irregular target. This implies that regular site and irregular site have less impact on editing efficiency. This conclusion is consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Third, it has been reported that the expression levels of Cas9 and sgRNA have an effect on editing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We tested the expression levels of Cas9 and sgRNA in 37 lines. Our results suggest that there is no regular relationship between mutation efficiency and the expression level of Cas9 and sgRNA in tomato. However, we do not deny that a significant increase in the expression levels of Cas9 and sgRNA can potentially increase the editing efficiency of the CRISPR system in plants. This may depend on the new highly efficient promoters. At last, we found that the secondary structure of sgRNA had a greater influence on editing efficiency. In particular, the editing efficiencies of <italic>SlGRAS8</italic>-target3 and <italic>slACS2&#x00026;4</italic>-target1 was significantly lower than other target sites in the same construct. This implies that the secondary structure of the sgRNA (containing the target site) is important for editing efficiency. This conclusion is consistent with the previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, the secondary structure, which cannot be directly observed from the sequence of the target site, may be more easily overlooked by researchers. So we recommend that researchers should select several candidate target sites from the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/">http://cbi.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/</ext-link>) and predict secondary structure of candidate sgRNA using the sgRNA sequence from our primer design aid. The target site selected in this way may be more effective. Therefore, we propose performing a secondary structure prediction using the sgRNA sequence given by our primer design aid (Excel&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Therefore, it is desirable to select the target site with about 30&#x02013;80% GC content and continuously pairing with sgRNA backbone less than 6 bases.</p><p id="Par43">PCR is presently used to identify positive T0 plant and the subsequent elimination of T1 plants containing transgenes. PCR is time consuming and laborious, especially when many plants in breeding populations must be screened. Hai-Ping Lu et al. (2017)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> down-regulated <italic>CYP81A6</italic> gene in rice through a CRISPR system containing <italic>CYP81A6</italic> RNAi expression cassettes to solve the problem in rice breeding. Rice in which <italic>CYP81A6</italic> is down-regulated is susceptible to bentazon. Researchers can use bentazon to screen for transgenic rice. However, the above scheme may be not apply to other crops. In fact for faster and high-throughput CRISPR methods for plant genome editing, the bottleneck is plant transformation and regeneration. To solve this problem, we think it is important to screen out explants that may regenerate positive plants from a large number of explants as soon as possible. So we proposed a visual T-DNA tag BioBrick in tomato. In our visual tag, <italic>AtMYB75</italic>/<italic>PAP1</italic> was driven by 35S promoter. Our preliminary results show that purple bud appear on explants in about 30 days using pHNCas9:OE<italic>AtMYB75</italic> and explant only need to be transferred one time during regeneration. Hence, the development of a visual CRISPR system is conducive to solve the bottleneck of high-throughput CRISPR in plant. In addition, researchers can directly select purple transgenic or green transgene-free plants in the offspring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
