In this study, six <italic>ZmGPDH</italic> genes were obtained by a thorough search against maize genome, and designated as <italic>ZmGPDH1-6</italic>, respectively. The structural and evolutionary analyses showed that the ZmGPDHs family had typical conserved domains and similar protein structures as the known GPDHs from other plant species. ZmGPDHs were divided into NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent type A form (ZmGPDH1-5) and FAD-dependent type B form (ZmGPDH6) based on their N-terminal sequences. Four full length ZmGPDHs were fused with GFP fusion proteins, and their subcellular localization was determined. ZmGPDH1 and ZmGPDH3 were located to the cytosol and mainly recruited to the surface of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas ZmGPDH4 and ZmGPDH5 were located in the chloroplast. The transcriptional analysis of the <italic>ZmGPDHs</italic> in different maize tissues revealed relatively high level of transcripts accumulation of <italic>ZmGPDHs</italic> in roots and early stage developing seeds. Furthermore, we examined the transcriptional responses of the six <italic>GPDH</italic> genes in maize under various abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, alkali and cold, and significant induction of <italic>ZmGPDH</italic>s under osmotic stresses was observed. Together, this work will provide useful information for deciphering the roles of GPDHs in plant development and abiotic stress responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0101002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6351-1030</contrib-id><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Scientific Start-up Found for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholar</institution></funding-source><award-id>2031011047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6351-1030</contrib-id><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Key Cultivateing Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>XA2014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6351-1030</contrib-id><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Graduate Student Innovation Fund Projects</institution></funding-source><award-id>YJSCX 2017-Z01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0101002); Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Scientific Start-up Found for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholar (2031011047); Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Key Cultivateing Program (XA2014-01); Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University Graduate Student Innovation Fund Projects (YJSCX 2017-Z01).

Enhanced level of G3P after feeding glycerol to developing seeds of rape results in an increase of carbon flux into triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, providing direct evidence that the rate of G3P provision may limit the biosynthesis of glycerolipid in seeds [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of G3P in a number of plants played important roles in their adaption to adverse stresses, including pathogenic microbes, salinity, freezing and anaerobic stresses [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As an inducer of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), G3P enhanced the resistance of distal tissues against pathogen infection [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Besides, the production of intracellular glycerol allows <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> and yeast to survive in hyperosmotic stress by maintaining a relatively low intracellular sodium concentration [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There are two primary metabolic pathways for the synthesis of G3P in higher plants. In the first pathway, G3P is generated directly from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent glycerol-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH, EC 1.1.1.8), catalyzing the reduction of NADH and DHAP to form NAD<sup>+</sup> and G3P. In the second pathway, G3P is produced via glycerol kinase (GK, EC 2.7.1.30)-mediated phosphorylation of glycerol [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Genes encoding GPDH have been characterized and cloned from algae and a few plant species, and most of these genes are proved to be key factors in response to different stresses [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are five isoforms of GPDH associating with different subcellular organelles: two cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent forms, two plastidic NAD<sup>+</sup>- dependent forms, and one mitochondrial FAD-linked form (EC 1.1.99.5) [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The FAD-GPDH encoded by <italic>AtGPDHm1</italic>, along with a cytosolic GPDH encoded by <italic>AtGPDHc1</italic>, could form a mitochondrial G-3-P shuttle that served as a critical route to maintain the homeostasis of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio under stresses [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies have showed that <italic>AtGPDHm1</italic> and <italic>AtGPDHc1</italic> are regulated by adverse stress conditions, such as salinity, dehydration and oxygen availability, and <italic>AtGPDHm1</italic> is also coupled to mitochondrial respiration [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Chanda et al. (2011) identified that the gene <italic>SFD1</italic>/<italic>GLY1</italic> encoding plastid-localized GPDH was involved in pathogen defense responses by affecting the total G3P pool in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, knocking down <italic>TaGLY1</italic> in wheat may inhibit G3P accumulation and compromise the resistance to stripe rust (<italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The expression of mushroom <italic>GPDH</italic> gene is dramatically induced by salt, dehydration and cold conditions, and over-expression of <italic>PsGPD</italic> can improve salt tolerance of transgenic rice [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Plant GPDHs also play important roles on glycerol lipid metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].The <italic>sfd</italic>/<italic>gly1</italic> mutants show severe impairment in plastidal glycerolipids pathway of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> without any effects on the synthesis of cytosolic TAG, suggesting that defection in plastidic GPDH has no impacts on glycerolipids assembly in the cytosol [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>SFD1/GLY1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also increases plastidic lipid contents in transgenic rice plants which is accompanied by a high photosynthetic assimilation rate [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Besides, two out of five GPDH enzymes in halophilic microalga (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii)</italic> have been shown to be necessary for nutrition deficiency-induced TAG synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Although <italic>GPDH</italic> genes have been cloned from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and some algae species, there is not much information available on GPDH gene family from other higher plants. In this study, a genome-wide identification of a family of 6 <italic>GPDH</italic> genes from maize genome was carried out. The bioinfomatic investigation of gene structure, evolutionary relationships, syntenic relations, protein three-dimensional (3D) structures was conducted. The subcellular localization of 4 ZmGPDHs was demonstrated. We also analyzed the transcripts accumulation of <italic>ZmGPDHs</italic> in different tissues and developmental stages by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the transcriptional level of <italic>ZmGPDHs</italic> was measured under various abiotic stresses, including salt, alkali, drought and cold treatments.

Although <italic>GPDH</italic> genes have been cloned from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and some algae species, there is not much information available on GPDHs from other higher plants. In the present work, we identified a <italic>GPDH</italic> gene family encoding six GPDHs in maize. Based on the prediction of subcellular localization and the sequences of N-terminal, ZmGPDHs were divided into three types: three cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>-GPDHs (ZmGPDH1, 2&#x00026;3), two plastidic NAD<sup>+</sup>-GPDHs (ZmGPDH 4&#x00026;5), and one mitochondrial FAD-GPDH (ZmGPDH6). Phylogenic analysis resulted in the same classification of ZmGPDHs by subdividing them into three clusters, which suggested the relatedness of distinct function of each group of <italic>GPDH</italic> genes with their evolutionary process.</p><p>All ZmGPDH proteins contain the specific and/or necessary protein domains (NAD<sub>-</sub>Gly3P<sub>-</sub> dh<sub>-</sub> N, NAD<sub>-</sub>Gly3P<sub>-</sub>dh<sub>-</sub>C, DAO, DAO_C), which may be significant for functional conservation. It has been reported that some <italic>GPDH</italic> genes from the genera <italic>Dunaliella</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> also have a phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) domain which functions as glycerol-3 -phosphatase and catalyzes the step transfering dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glycerol directly [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, we did not found any PSP domain in ZmGPDH proteins. Moreover, the previously reported NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent GPDs exhibited an identical binding frame analogous to GXGXXG, in which the first two glycines take part in NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding, and the third promotes close packing of the helix to the beta-strand [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, we found that ZmGPDH1 and ZmGPDH2 contained the conserved GAGAWG motif at residues 44&#x02013;50, and ZmGPDH4 had a GSGNWG motif at residues 16&#x02013;21. Interestedly, ZmGPDH3 had a GARAWG motif at residues 42&#x02013;48 similar to GAGAWG, while the effect of this G to R variation needed to be further studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200357.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The FAD-dependent ZmGPDH6 shared no sequence homology with other NAD<sup>+</sup>-GPDHs in maize, while a putative FAD-binding motif (<monospace>DVLVIGGGATGCGVALDAVTRGLRVGLVER</monospace>) as well as sequences involved in G-3-P binding (<monospace>DVLSAWSGIRPLA; GLITITGGKWTTYRSMAE</monospace>) were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200357.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the phylogenic, gene structural and syntenic analysis provided functional and evolutionary connections among <italic>GPDH</italic> genes from different plant species.

On the other hand, we couldn&#x02019;t find any transmembrane regions in the amino acid sequence of ZmGPDH1 or ZmGPDH3 protein, which meant the two proteins were soluble, and since the biosynthesis of glycerolipids mainly occurred in ER, so it was conceivable that ZmGPDH1 or ZmGPDH3 might be recruited to the surface of ER for their proper functionality. To our knowledge, ZmGPDH1 and ZmGPDH3 are the first plant GPDH isoforms known to be targeted to cytosol and mainly dispersed around the ER. The earlier identified two cytosolic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtGPDHc proteins are predicted to accumulate in the cytosol due to the absence of obvious subcellular targeting sequences and transmembrane regions, but the experimental evidence has been lacking [<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200357.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

This result may provide important information for further studying on the biological roles of <italic>GPDH</italic> genes in plant development and abiotic stresses response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of ZmGPDH1-GFP or ZmGPDH3-GFP fusion proteins.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>Cis</italic>-elements in the promoter regions of the ZmGPDHs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Multiple alignment of protein sequences of maize and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GPDHs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The gene ID and chromosomal location of <italic>GPDH</italic> genes used in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The syntenic relationships among maize, rice, soybean, and sorghum GPDH genes.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s006"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>The primers used in this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s007"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The predicted 3D models of ZmGPDH1-6.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s007.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200357.s008"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>The intron and exon boundary of <italic>ZmGPDH1</italic>, <italic>ZmGPDH3</italic>, and <italic>ZmGPDH4&#x00026;5</italic>.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0200357.s008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express our gratitude to the laboratory members for their help and input during this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0200357.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Swinnen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thevelein</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Nevoigt</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>Glycerol metabolism and transport in yeast and fungi: established knowledge and ambiguities</article-title>. <source>Environmental Microbiology</source>. <year>2017</year>; <volume>19</volume>: <fpage>878</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>893</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13617">10.1111/1462-2920.13617</ext-link></comment>
