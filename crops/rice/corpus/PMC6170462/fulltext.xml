The integration of azolla, fish and ducks has been shown to create robust systems that maintain high yields under heavy rainfall, but no clear evidence exists that rice yields in these systems are stable across locations and throughout time under divergent weather conditions. We show that the introduction of additional elements into the rice cropping system enhanced the adaptive capacity to extreme weather events across four locations and three cropping cycles. The complex system showed both static and dynamic stability, and had the highest reliability index, thereby outperforming the conventional and organic monoculture systems. The complex rice system design provides a promising example for resilience towards the impacts of climate change on rice production and for safeguarding food security in Asia and beyond.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Climate change is expected to increase the variability in weather conditions and the frequency of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which will have direct effects on agricultural production worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Water logging may decrease rice yields through hypoxia, while heavy rains disturb pollination, fertilization, and grain-filling processes.

Border plants consisted of green manures and vegetables, which can supply food and feed, and refugia to attract natural enemies. Hence, no pesticides were applied in the CRS treatments.

In contrast, labor input for fertilization was also positively related to CRS. Furthermore, the bi-plot presents a negative correlation between yield and cycles 1 and 3 which were associated with high precipitation levels.

These patterns provided a highly variable weather scenario suitable to test resilience of our three systems. Under variable conditions and with the occurrence of extreme events, the most stable system is not necessarily the system with the highest mean yield. In general, CRSs had the highest mean yield and yields were less affected by unfavorable environments than for the other treatments. Likewise, although the yields in organic were lower than in conventional, however, rice yields were reduced less severely than in the conventional treatment during bad cropping cycles. Nevertheless, the strength of this treatment effect varied by location and between cropping cycles.</p><p id="Par13">In Malang, for example, CRS, organic and conventional yields in the first cycle were 23%, 35% and 47% lower, respectively, than in the second cycle (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,6)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28,824, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001). Whereas, in the third cycle, reductions of CRS, organic and conventional yields were 22%, 30% and 61%, lower, respectively than in the second cycle (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,6)</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;64.871, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The use of bio-pesticides in the organic systems might have been less harmful to natural enemies than by the use of chemical pesticides in conventional rice production. This may help to maintain higher levels of natural enemies (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), partly protecting rice plants from pests during unfavourable cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Besides, organic cropping system obviously eliminates the dependency on agro-chemicals (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), resulting in smaller negative impacts to the environment than conventional systems.</p><p id="Par14">The CRSs appeared to be most resilient to the impacts of extreme weather events on rice yields, by integrating flora and fauna resulting in ecosystem functions of weed and pest suppression and increased nutrient cycling. The feeding and movement behavior of the ducks and fish, combined with the presence of refugia can facilitate natural enemies to control pests and weeds, thereby also reducing labor inputs. The labor input for fertilization in CRS might high, which was allocated to manage green manure biomass, including activities such as cutting, drying and soil incorporation. However, the total labor inputs were much less than those in conventional and organic. The higher the quantity of green manure produced in CRS, resulted in the higher reduction imports of fertilizers (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">In our CRS, duck manure, azolla and sun hemp support the ecosystem function of nutrient cycling (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), which is further accelerated by the ducks and fish activities. Besides, the activities of ducks and fish can increase the oxygen supply which leads to better rice root growth and nitrogen uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Higher root density increased nutrient uptake to enhance rice yields and might reduce pollutions. Moreover, adding components and outputs to the system such as duck, fish, egg, string bean, corn, taro and papaya could contribute to the stability of whole farm production, especially when one commodity fails during unfavourable weather conditions (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Our results show that the occurrence of extreme weather events is a deciding factor in reducing rice yields and indeed potentially threatening the stability of global production. The results also revealed that common practices in rice production systems, such as the use of chemicals and extra labor inputs for weeding and pest control, were ineffective to suppress weeds and pests during unfavorable weather conditions to the same degree as in CRSs (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>; Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Possible explanations for ineffectiveness of pesticides include (i) rain-induced run-off of pesticides, (ii) alkaline hydrolysis and degradation of pesticides to an inactive form, as induced by fluctuations in temperature and water pH, and (iii) phyto-toxicity of some pesticides induced by high temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These effects may be further aggravated in practical situations on smallholder farms, since illiteracy and suboptimal managerial skills of smallholders may cause improper application timing, pesticide mixing and pest identification.</p><p id="Par17">We conclude that CRSs are resilient to the effects of extreme weather events and provide flexible mechanisms to control weeds and pests in unfavourable weather conditions, thus providing more robustness compared to other rice production systems. Finally, the stable and reliable yields of CRSs across strongly contrasting locations in our experiment show that the design is scalable and replicable, warranting out-scaling and prioritizing to other rice producing countries. This can contribute to reducing smallholder risks, while maintaining rice productivity and yield stability to safeguard national food security under climate change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par18">The experimental sites were in the Lamongan sub-district of Lamongan (7&#x000b0;08&#x002b9;27.10&#x02033;S &#x02212; 112&#x000b0;23&#x002b9;46.79&#x02033;E), Kepanjen sub-district of Malang (8&#x000b0;09&#x002b9;11.82&#x02033;S &#x02212; 112&#x000b0;34&#x002b9;33.32&#x02033;E), Gandusari sub-district of Blitar (7&#x000b0;59&#x002b9;34.14&#x02033;S &#x02212; 112&#x000b0;18&#x002b9;21.79&#x02033;E) and the Prigen sub-district of Pasuruan (7&#x000b0;41&#x002b9;49.82&#x02033;S &#x02212; 112&#x000b0;37&#x002b9;40.44&#x02033;E).

In the second cycle, 90% of planted sun hemp was cut every month after the first cut (45 days old) and incorporated into the soil as green manure or dried for feed. The remaining 10% was left to produce flowers and seeds. Due to the low survival rate of fingerlings in the first and second cycles, leading to low fish yields, fish ponds were deepened and widened. Fingerlings changed to adult fish (four to five months old and about 200 gr per fish) to be released in CRS plots. The adult fish density was 500 fish per hectare that can produce fingerlings between 5&#x02013;10 days after release. Fingerlings that hatched on the rice field could immediately adapt to the environment, which is a crucial factor for successful fish production.</p><p id="Par25">Duck houses were constructed on the bund surrounded by sun hemp. Straw from previous cropping was heaped next to the duck house and pond to be decomposed and later eaten by fish. The total amount of feed supplied to one duck for the duration of 155 days was approximately 20&#x02009;kg (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). In the first cycle, all duck feed was imported, but in the second and third cycles ducks were fed rice bran and corn from previous cycles. Sun hemp and azolla also provided feed for ducks and fish. The ducks also preyed on wild animals and plants, such as weeds, snails, crabs, tadpoles and insects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Measurements and Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Weather data</title><p id="Par26">During the experiment, all weather data were recorded using the weather station installed on each experimental farm.

In general, artificial fertilizers were applied three times during one rice growing cycle in conventional systems, but only once in organic systems, at three to five days before transplantation of rice plants at the second ploughing stage. Fertilizer application in CRS was similar to that in organic plots but the sources were partly supplied by sun hemp and azolla. Labor inputs for weeding and pests management included: (i) agro-chemical applications and hand weeding in conventional, (ii) spraying bio-pesticides and hand weeding in organic, and (iii) animal management in CRSs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measurement of plants and animals</title><p id="Par28">Rice yield was measured by harvesting 6.25&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> of rice plants in the middle of the plot at harvesting time. Rice grain was removed from the straw and placed in paper bags to be dried in an oven at 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;hours and weighed to obtain the dry matter yield of rice kernels. Fresh weight of fish, ducks and eggs were determined at the end of each cycle. A sample of sun hemp plants was oven dried at 80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;hours and weighed to record the dry matter mass.

Ten nets were swept in each plot at 90 DAT and the insects were kept in a clear bottle containing 75% alcohol.

We used log10 and sqrt transformations where necessary. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the experimental treatment effects followed by Tukey&#x02019;s and LSD post-hoc tests to establish significant differences between treatments. Statistical tests were conducted with SPSS 23 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). We visualized interactions between rice yields, environment, rice production systems and labor inputs using the biplot function in the CANOCO 5 software for Windows.</p><p id="Par31">We used static and dynamic stability analysis approaches in our study.
