We reveal here that a fungal effector named NIS1 is broadly conserved in filamentous fungi in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, thus being regarded as a core effector, and has the ability to suppress PAMP-triggered immunity. Importantly, NIS1 targets BAK1 and BIK1, interfering with their essential functions for immune activation upon pathogen recognition. Multifaceted analyses including the knockout of <italic>NIS1</italic> revealed that it plays a critical role in fungal infection. These findings demonstrate that to infect host plants, filamentous fungi deploy a core effector that attacks conserved immune kinases critical for the ancestral defense system.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Plant pathogens have optimized their own effector sets to adapt to their hosts. However, certain effectors, regarded as core effectors, are conserved among various pathogens, and may therefore play an important and common role in pathogen virulence. We report here that the widely distributed fungal effector NIS1 targets host immune components that transmit signaling from pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants. NIS1 from two <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp. suppressed the hypersensitive response and oxidative burst, both of which are induced by pathogen-derived molecules, in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> NIS1 also suppressed the two defense responses, although this pathogen likely acquired the <italic>NIS1</italic> gene via horizontal transfer from Basidiomycota. Interestingly, the root endophyte <italic>Colletotrichum tofieldiae</italic> also possesses a <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog that can suppress the oxidative burst in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. We show that NIS1 of multiple pathogens commonly interacts with the PRR-associated kinases BAK1 and BIK1, thereby inhibiting their kinase activities and the BIK1-NADPH oxidase interaction. Furthermore, mutations in the NIS1-targeting proteins, i.e., BAK1 and BIK1, in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> also resulted in reduced immunity to <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> fungi. Finally, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> lacking <italic>NIS1</italic> displayed significantly reduced virulence on rice and barley, its hosts. Our study therefore reveals that a broad range of filamentous fungi maintain and utilize the core effector NIS1 to establish infection in their host plants and perhaps also beneficial interactions, by targeting conserved and central PRR-associated kinases that are also known to be targeted by bacterial effectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BAK1</kwd><kwd>BIK1</kwd><kwd>core effector</kwd><kwd>PAMP-triggered immunity</kwd><kwd>phytopathogenic fungi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001691</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">15H05780</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Yoshitaka Takano</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100001691</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">18H02204</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Yoshitaka Takano</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Plants have evolved two layers of antimicrobial defenses: pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). PTI is mediated by membrane-embedded receptor-like proteins (RLPs), receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), whereas ETI generally occurs when cytoplasmic resistance (R) proteins detect specific pathogen effectors (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The immune kinases BAK1/SERK3 and BIK1 have been studied extensively in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as the central regulatory RLK and RLCK, respectively, working with multiple pattern recognition receptors for PAMP sensing and signaling (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). FLS2, another well-characterized RLK that recognizes the bacterial PAMP flagellin (flg22), recruits BAK1 upon ligand perception to initiate PTI signaling (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In contrast, BIK1 forms a complex with FLS2 in the steady state (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Upon flg22 elicitation, BAK1 associates with FLS2 and phosphorylates BIK1; activated BIK1 then phosphorylates BAK1 and FLS2 before dissociating from the FLS2-BAK1 complex to transmit the signal to the downstream pathway (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Phosphorylated BIK1 also activates the NADPH oxidase RBOHD through phosphorylation events to trigger a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, which is one of the earliest PTI responses (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Many types of bacterial pathogen effectors target these RLK- and RLCK-type kinases. For example, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> AvrPto, AvrPtoB, HopF2, and HopB1 target BAK1, and <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> Xoo2875 targets OsBAK1 (the BAK1 homolog in rice) (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). AvrPto and AvrPtoB bind to BAK1 and interfere with formation of the FLS2-BAK1 complex (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>P. syringae</italic> AvrPphB and <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> AvrAC target BIK1 (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). AvrPphB, a cysteine protease, degrades PBS1-like kinases, including BIK1 (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), while the uridylyl transferase AvrAC conceals important phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of BIK1 (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These findings strongly suggested that inhibiting these RLK- and RLCK-type kinases is advantageous to bacterial pathogens. However, it remained unclear whether this strategy is also employed by fungal and oomycete pathogens.</p><p>Our knowledge of the molecular functions of fungal and oomycete effectors is now expanding. The reported functions of these effectors are highly diverse and include inhibition of host-secreted lytic enzymes (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), modulation of the plant ubiquitination system (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), autophagy (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and blocking of the exposure of the fungal PAMP chitin to its corresponding receptor(s) in plants (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Here we report that a so-called &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; effector named necrosis-inducing secreted protein 1 (NIS1), which is highly conserved in filamentous fungal plant pathogens, has the ability to target RLKs such as BAK1 and the RLCK BIK1 and thereby to impair PTI signaling. Core effectors can be defined by their wide distribution among strains of a particular pathogen. For example, high-throughput genome sequencing of 65 strains of <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>manihotis</italic>, the causal agent of cassava bacterial blight, revealed that all strains shared nine common effectors, indicating that these nine are core effectors in this bacterial pathogen (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). On the other hand, extensive genome analyses on fungal pathogens also reveal the presence of abundant homologous effector proteins across different species, which are likewise widely defined as core effectors. NIS1 was first identified in cucumber anthracnose fungus, <italic>Colletotrichum orbiculare</italic>, as an effector that causes cell death in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>Nb</italic>) after <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Notably, this effector was found to be broadly conserved in filamentous fungal pathogens, and we therefore considered NIS1 as a putative core effector. However, deletion of <italic>NIS1</italic> had no effect on <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> virulence on its natural host, cucumber. Since <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> infects <italic>Nb</italic> in addition to Cucurbitaceae (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), we also inoculated the <italic>nis1</italic>&#x02206; strain of <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> onto <italic>Nb</italic>; again, however, the mutant exhibited WT-like virulence on <italic>Nb</italic>. Therefore, the molecular and physiological function of this effector remained elusive.</p><p>In this study, we show that <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> NIS1, as well as NIS1 homologs of the crucifer anthracnose fungus <italic>Colletotrichum higginsianum</italic> and the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, commonly suppress both hypersensitive response (HR) cell death triggered by the oomycete PAMP INF1 and ROS generation triggered by flg22 and the fungal PAMP chitin in <italic>Nb</italic>. These findings indicate that NIS1 suppresses multiple PTI responses in <italic>Nb</italic>. Our study demonstrates that NIS1 targets the RLK BAK1 and its orthologs in other plants, and also the RLCK BIK1, both of which are critical for PTI. The study also revealed that both BAK1 and BIK1 targeted by NIS1 are critical for plant immunity in <italic>Arabidipsis</italic> toward <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> fungi. We found that transient expression of NIS1 in <italic>Nb</italic> enhanced susceptibility to <italic>C. orbiculare</italic>. Furthermore, targeted gene disruption of <italic>NIS1</italic> in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> resulted in a severe reduction of virulence on both barley and rice susceptible cultivars, indicating the importance of the conserved effector NIS1 for fungal virulence.</p><p>Our data show that lineages of pathogens as different as bacteria and fungi share an effector-mediated strategy to interfere with immune kinases that transmit signaling from pathogen-recognizing receptors, suggesting that this effector innovation in phytopathogens has been essential to cope with PTI, which is probably universal in plants. The finding that NIS1 is conserved in a broad range of filamentous fungi in both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota also tells us that the effector NIS1 was already present in the common ancestor of these phyla and has been evolutionarily maintained to facilitate plant infection.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>The Conserved Filamentous Fungal Effector NIS1 Suppresses INF1-Induced Cell Death and Interacts with BAK1.</title><p>We previously identified the effector NIS1 (hereafter called CoNIS1) from the hemibiotroph <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> as a secreted protein that induces cell death in <italic>Nb</italic> (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

CoNIS1 homologs are conserved in a broad range of fungi belonging to Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Orbiliomycetes, and Leotiomycetes in the Ascomycota, and to Exobasidiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, and Tremellomycetes in the Basidiomycota, which include numerous pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807297116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>).

It was previously reported that the fungal effector Pep1 is essential for host penetration by <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Pep1 is conserved in Ustilaginaceae, where it is regarded as a core effector (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), but not outside this family. In contrast, the effector NIS1 is conserved in fungi belonging to both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Thus, we consider that NIS1 is a core effector, acquired anciently by fungal pathogens. This idea is supported by our finding that NIS1 targets PAMP recognition and signaling machineries that are probably universally conserved in higher plants. Indeed, it was recently reported that the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> recognizes chitin and mounts defense responses via the RLK CERK1 (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), indicating that RLK-dependent PAMP recognition is an ancestral system in plants.</p><p>Since the sequence of NIS1 has no similarity to bacterial effectors that target RLKs and RLCKs, our findings also suggest independent effector innovation in bacterial and fungal pathogens to attack RLK and RLCK class kinases that are critical for PTI. Independent effector innovation at the interkingdom level has also been detected in multiple plant proteins such as Rcr3 protease, which is targeted by protease inhibitors from pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). BAK1-related RLKs and BIK1-related RLCKs are well conserved and critical for PTI; thus, we consider that once a fungus had innovated NIS1, it was essential to maintain it as a core effector during evolution. In contrast to NIS1, bacterial effectors that attack RLKs and RLCKs, such as AvrPto, are not broadly conserved among bacterial pathogens. It remains unclear why this type of effector is not widely conserved among bacterial pathogens. As noted above, genome sequencing of 65 strains of <italic>X. axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>manihotis</italic> identified nine core effectors that are shared by all tested strains of this bacterial pathogen (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, these effectors are not strongly conserved in <italic>X. campestris</italic>. Furthermore, there is no overlap between <italic>X. campestris</italic> and <italic>P. syringae</italic> core effectomes (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In contrast, many putative core effectors are conserved in fungal species: for example, &#x0223c;200 core effector-like genes are conserved in four different <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), suggesting that infection strategies based on core effectors, including NIS1, are more important in fungal pathogens than in bacterial pathogens.</p><p>The expression of CoNIS1 and ChNIS1, but not MoNIS1, caused necrotic lesion formation in <italic>Nb</italic> (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), whereas CoNIS1, ChNIS1, and MoNIS1 commonly suppressed INF1-induced cell death and PAMP-triggered ROS generation in <italic>Nb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figs. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4<italic>A</italic></xref>). CoNIS1 lacking its C-terminal 30 amino acids (CoNIS1&#x02206;C30) strongly reduced necrotic lesion development (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in comparison with full-length CoNIS1, and this region is missing in MoNIS1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807297116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Thus, the corresponding region is dispensable for plant immune suppression but is important to induce necrotic lesions, possibly via plant recognition and activation of cell death as a counterdefense. In this context, it is notable that <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> deploys an effector, DN3, that can reduce CoNIS1-triggered plant cell death (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). <italic>MoNIS1</italic> is phylogenetically distant from <italic>CoNIS1</italic> and is likely to originate from an <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog of the Basidiomycota. Considering that <italic>Valsa mali</italic>, a Sordariomycete fungus phylogenetically close to <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, carries two copies of <italic>NIS1</italic> homologs, one of which is closely related to <italic>MoNIS1</italic> while the other belongs to the same clade as <italic>CoNIS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807297116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4</ext-link>), <italic>M. oryzae</italic> or a close ancestor species appears to have lost its <italic>CoNIS1</italic>-like <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog. The loss of this <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog might have enabled the pathogen to avoid recognition by a particular host plant while maintaining the essential ability to suppress host immunity by expressing the other <italic>NIS1</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly, it was recently reported that the expression of the <italic>Fusarium virguliforme</italic> NIS1 ortholog induced sudden death syndrome foliar symptoms in soybean, mimicking the development of soybean foliar symptoms caused by <italic>F. virguliforme</italic> itself in the field (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Thus, NIS1-triggered cell death via plant recognition may be deployed by a pathogen for enhancing virulence in certain plant&#x02013;fungal pathogen interactions. It is also noteworthy that the root endophyte fungus <italic>C. tofieldiae</italic> possesses a <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807297116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>), and this fungus exhibits high expression of the <italic>NIS1</italic> homolog during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> colonization (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We revealed that the <italic>C. tofieldiae</italic> NIS1 homolog suppresses flg22-triggered ROS generation in <italic>Nb</italic> in the same way as the pathogenic fungal NIS1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>). This suggests that <italic>C. tofieldiae</italic> uses NIS1 to colonize <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, i.e., the endophyte fungus needs effectors, including NIS1, to establish its beneficial interaction with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Expression of CoNIS1 and its orthologs in <italic>Nb</italic> almost completely abolishes flg22-triggered ROS generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). We found that NIS1 interacts with BIK1, resulting in the inhibition of the BIK1-RBOHD interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). BIK1 induces flg22-triggered ROS generation by phosphorylating RBOHD in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RBOHD shares high similarity with NbRbohB (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and complements the loss of the flg22-induced ROS burst in <italic>NbRbohB</italic>-silenced <italic>Nb</italic> plants (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), indicating that NbRbohB is a functional ortholog of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RBOHD. Although a functional ortholog of BIK1 has not yet been identified in <italic>Nb</italic>, we propose that NIS1 targets such an ortholog, inhibiting the PAMP-triggered ROS generation that largely depends on NbRbohB (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>BIK1 is a key component that links PTI signals from transmembrane PAMP receptor complexes to intracellular immune responses, although it is unclear how BIK1 regulates downstream signaling except for the direct activation of RBOHD (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The <italic>rbohb</italic>-silenced <italic>Nb</italic> displayed reduced ROS production and decreased resistance to <italic>P. infestans</italic> (<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, <italic>rbohb</italic> silencing did not reduce the immunity of <italic>Nb</italic> to <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> (<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), whereas the expression of NIS1 in <italic>Nb</italic> enhanced susceptibility to <italic>C. orbiculare</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). This indicates that inhibition of PAMP-triggered ROS generation is insufficient to reduce <italic>Nb</italic> immunity to <italic>C. orbiculare</italic>. Consistent with this, both <italic>Arabidopsis rbohD</italic> and <italic>rbohF</italic> mutants maintain immunity to <italic>C. tropicale</italic> (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), but in contrast the <italic>Arabidopsis bik1</italic> mutant as well as the <italic>bak1-5</italic> mutant display reduced immunity to the same pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). It is necessary to investigate further the plant defense pathways that are effective against <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> fungi, which partially depend on BAK1 and its related RLKs as well as BIK1 and may be dampened by NIS1. We also showed that MoNIS1 suppressed R3a/Avr3a-dependent HR cell death in <italic>Nb</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1807297116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8</ext-link>), which is not suppressed in <italic>serk3</italic>-silenced <italic>Nb</italic> (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, NIS1 may have additional targets, probably belonging to a kinase family that regulates R3a/Avr3a-triggered ETI.</p><p>Deletion of the <italic>NIS1</italic> ortholog <italic>MoNIS1</italic> severely compromised the virulence of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> on rice and barley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).
