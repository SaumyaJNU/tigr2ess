    "Background:Rice not only produces grains for human beings, but also provides large amounts of lignocellulose residues, which recently highlighted as feedstock for biofuel production. Genetic modification of plant cell walls can potentially enhance biomass saccharification; however, it remains a challenge to maintain a normal growth with enhanced lodging resistance in rice. Results:In this study, rice (Oryza sativa) mutant fc17, which harbors the substitution (F426S) at the plant-conserved region (P-CR) of cellulose synthase 4 (CESA4) protein, exhibited slightly affected plant growth and 17% higher lodging resistance compared to the wild-type. More importantly, the mutant showed a 1.68-fold enhancement in biomass saccharification efficiency. Cell wall composition analysis showed a reduction in secondary wall thickness and cellulose content, and compensatory increase in hemicelluloses and lignin content. Both X-ray diffraction and calcofluor staining demonstrated a significant reduction in cellulose crystallinity, which should be a key factor for its high saccharification. Proteomic profiling of wild-type and fc17 plants further indicated a possible mechanism by which mutation induces cellulose deposition and cell wall remodeling. Conclusion:These results suggest that CESA4 P-CR site mutation affects cell wall features especially cellulose structure and thereby causes enhancement in biomass digestion and lodging resistance. Therefore, CESA4 P-CR region is promising target for cell wall modification to facilitate the breeding of bioenergy rice."
