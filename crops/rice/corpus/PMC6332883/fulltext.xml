The symptoms caused by ToTV may be considered as one of the most severe virus-induced forms of systemic necrosis, which spreads within the whole plant and leads to a lethal phenotype. However, to date there are no data revealing which viral genes encode for a specific pathogenicity determinant that triggers the plant necrotic response for any torradovirus. In this study we evaluated the influence of three coat protein subunits of ToTV: Vp23, Vp26 and Vp35, transiently expressed from a PVX-based vector, and checked their association with the induction of systemic necrosis in infected <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.

Therefore, much effort has been applied to mapping and identifying the host genes involved directly in plant defense responses to virus infection. However, the second component of the interactions&#x02014;the virus-derived pathogenicity determinants&#x02014;need to be defined and isolated to identify mechanisms of disease initiation at the very early stages of infection. The well-described RNA silencing suppressor of the cucumber mosaic virus, the 2b protein, which influences local and systemic viral movement, has been reported as a virulence-determining factor in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, where it induces mild mosaic symptoms on upper, non-inoculated leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the cited research the 2b protein was described to act as virulence determinant involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing - a well described plant defence mechanism against viruses. Interestingly, it has also been indicated that coat proteins (CPs), in parallel with their structural function, may also play an important role in the elicitation of disease symptoms, for example, one of the biological functions of the p42 protein of melon necrotic spot virus is directly associated with symptom induction in infected melon plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The hypersensitive response (HR), that in some cases accompanies virus infection, is based generally on the isolation of virus-infected cells from adjacent healthy tissue, thus preventing further spread of such cells within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An invading pathogen triggers a cascade of reactions, resulting in a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected cells. The level of ROS and strength of the oxygen burst are strictly controlled by cellular peroxidases (POX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalases. The HR was described to be induced by 2b of cucumber mosaic virus interacting with catalase CAT3 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] whereas transient expression of the NSm protein in leaves of Sw-5 tomato or Sw-5 transgenic <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> resulted in a hypersensitive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par29"><italic>Tomato torrado virus</italic> (ToTV) has been classified within the genus <italic>Torradovirus</italic> in the family <italic>Secoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Torradoviruses have a bipartite genome consisting of positive sense (+), single-stranded RNAs encapsidated into nonenveloped virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. RNA1 (7829 nucleotides-nt) encodes for a long polyprotein (2158 amino acids) involved in virus replication. RNA2 (5404&#x02009;nt) encodes for two open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 (187 amino acids), that is necessary for systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and a long ORF encoding a polyprotein (1198 amino acids) that can be proteolytically processed into a movement protein (3A) and three coat protein (CP) subunits: Vp35, Vp26 and Vp23 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In the presence of viral proteinase, both ToTV polyproteins are cleaved to functional proteins; however, the precise cleavage sites have not yet been identified. In a field and greenhouse conditions ToTV is transmitted by insects. Once the pathogen has been acquired by its vector, the whitefly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it can be transmitted efficiently to a host, particularly <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>. The virus spreads within the tomato plants, leading to severe necrosis of the leaves (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), stems and even fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has been indicated that the virus may infect and accumulate in weed species, which serve as a potential source of infection of economically important plant-hosts of the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Molecular and biological properties of tomato torrado virus. <bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of the ToTV genome. The genomic material of ToTV comprises two polyadenylated RNA strands, RNA1 and RNA2, composed of 7829 nucleotides and 5404 nucleotides, respectively. RNA1 encodes for protease cofactor (PrcCo), helicase (Hel), viral protease (Pro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). RNA2 encodes for ORF1&#x000a0;(necessary for systemic infection) and ORF2 encoding&#x000a0;movement protein (3A) followed by three capsid protein (CP) subunits (Vp35, Vp26 and Vp23).

As a starting point, we assumed that, as the natural way for ToTV transmission in the environment is via whiteflies, hence fully assembled ToTV virion-particles delivered from the vector&#x02019;s stylet may be exposed to the cellular environment at the first outset of virus invasion. Moreover, supported by previous reports that CPs can be responsible for the induction of symptoms, or their modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], we focused on the influence of three ToTV CP subunits&#x02014;namely, Vp23, Vp26 and Vp35&#x02014;on the plant response to these molecules. Indeed, we have shown that the Vp26 subunit of a ToTV CP is responsible for the development of systemic necrosis similar to torrado disease symptoms when the protein was over-expressed heterologously from a PVX-based vector in tomato plants.

As all the mentioned plants used in our study were inoculated mechanically after introducing <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> into the leaves, this may have affected the T2 activity in the experimental tomato plants. Therefore, we omitted the enzyme in our further analyses.</p><p id="Par71">In the induced RNAse fraction by Vp26, several PR proteins were identified. MS analysis pointed additionally to the pathogenesis protein PR10a (formerly STH-2), which was chosen for further transcript profiling. Previously, it was shown that <italic>PR10</italic> expression from <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> had been induced during the incompatible interaction with TMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in pepper as well as in <italic>Solanum virginianum</italic> (<italic>S. sutattense</italic>), where the SsPR10 was stress- and pathogen-induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Vp26 also triggered an increase in a PR STH-2-like transcript in <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>, and thus may function as the elicitor of the STH-2-like response. Notably, Choi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] previously reported that the RNase-activity possessing PR-10 was essential to triggering an HR response, and the silencing of its expression compromised resistance in pepper. This correlation between induction of HR by RNases was also described by Kim and Hwang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] for pathogenesis-related protein 4c isolated from pepper. The PR4c (possessing ribonuclease activity) caused HR cell death in pepper leaves, which was accompanied by enhanced accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and significant induction of some defense-response genes. This aligns with the data presented here in our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par72">In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the molecular fundamentals of torrado disease pathogenesis regarding the CPs of the ToTV. Using the experimental system based on a PVX-Vp26 recombinant virus, we showed that Vp26 may be considered as an effector protein inducing a lethal systemic necrosis phenotype in plants where the molecule is expressed in a context of virus infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
