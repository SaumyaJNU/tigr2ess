It is imperative for crop improvement to discover and utilize stress-tolerant functional genes. In this study, genes responding to abiotic stresses, such as freezing, salt and osmotic stress, were screened from a cDNA yeast library that was constructed from the drought- and heat-tolerant wheat variety Hanxuan 10. After screening for surviving clones we isolated 7,249, 4,313 and 4,469 raw sequences, corresponding to 4,695, 2,641 and 2,771 genes following each treatment. Venn diagrams revealed 377 overlapping genes. GO analysis suggested that these genes were mainly involved in the metabolic and stress signal pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the isolated genes predominantly belonged to pathways concerning energy and metabolism. Overlapping gene <italic>TaPR-1-1</italic> within the pathogenesis-related (PR) protein family was selected for detailed characterization. Although previous studies had shown that <italic>PR</italic> genes function during pathogen attack, our results demonstrated that <italic>TaPR-1-1</italic> expression was also induced by freezing, salinity, and osmotic stresses. Overexpression in yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that <italic>TaPR-1-1</italic> conferred tolerance to these stresses.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates are that the demand for food will increase greatly by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

During the last few decades numerous functional factors thought to have a role in abiotic stress response have been isolated; these include components of the SOS (Salt Overly Sensitive) pathway, abscisic acid (ABA) pathway, kinases, phosphatases, ion transporters, and transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Methods for isolating genes include map-based cloning, yeast two hybrid analysis, transcriptomics analysis, proteomics analysis, biochemical methods, and cloning by homology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

Because cellular responses to stress are conserved in eukaryotes, yeast is a much easier model for genetic research than plants, and heterologous proteins in yeast are biologically active, and undergo similar behavior to plants in respect of protein folding and glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. According to Zhu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> stress signaling pathways in plants evolved from yeast and mammalian energy sensing indicating that many stress tolerance components should be conserved.</p><p id="Par4">Several genes involved in abiotic stress response were identified by screening plant cDNA libraries expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> or yeast. For example, a mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase gene from a rice cDNA yeast library was identified as source of salinity response, the <italic>Dbf2</italic> kinase gene from an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cDNA yeast library was identified as an essential part of stress tolerance, and SR-like splicing proteins were isolated from a cDNA yeast <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> library developed following salt treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, there are no similar reports for wheat and wheat cDNA yeast libraries are needed to identify stress-related genes. Similar studies in other plant species have not reported enrichment analyses for genes detected in screens. With release of the wheat genome sequence, screening cDNA yeast libraries to identify wheat stress-tolerance genes is feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Pathogenesis-related protein (PR-1) was first discovered in tobacco leaves infected by tobacco mosaic virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Other studies suggested that PR proteins also function in abiotic stress. For example, AtPR protein had a role in seed germination under salt stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and AtPR1, AtPR2, and AtPR5 functioned in response to drought stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.
