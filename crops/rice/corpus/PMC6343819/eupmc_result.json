    "Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is one of the most important pasture grasses in the world. However, seed production is negatively impacted by the seed shattering (shedding) nature of this species. Recently, genes involved in the seed shattering process have been isolated and functionally characterized in several crop species. The aim of this study was to identify the genes playing critical roles in the seed shattering process in perennial ryegrass. DNA sequences of genes involved in seed shattering in the Poaceae were used to identify and isolate target genes in perennial ryegrass using a comparative genomics strategy. The candidate seed shattering genes were identified using an 'in-house' perennial ryegrass transcriptome database. The relative expression levels of the candidate ryegrass shattering genes were determined using RT-qPCR during different floret and seed developmental stages. Histological analysis of the abscission layer was also conducted. Homologues of seed shattering genes were identified and isolated from perennial ryegrass, and the relative gene expression results suggested that several genes, including LpqSH1 and LpSH1, might have a role in abscission layer formation during seed development. In addition, lignification of the abscission layer may play an important role in the abscission process. A genetic model for seed shattering in perennial ryegrass is suggested and may be useful for directing gene editing towards the production of a reduced-shattering ryegrass."
