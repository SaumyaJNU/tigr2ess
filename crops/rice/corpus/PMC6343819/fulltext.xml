However, seed production is negatively impacted by the seed shattering (shedding) nature of this species. Recently, genes involved in the seed shattering process have been isolated and functionally characterized in several crop species. The aim of this study was to identify the genes playing critical roles in the seed shattering process in perennial ryegrass. DNA sequences of genes involved in seed shattering in the Poaceae were used to identify and isolate target genes in perennial ryegrass using a comparative genomics strategy. The candidate seed shattering genes were identified using an &#x02018;in-house&#x02019; perennial ryegrass transcriptome database. The relative expression levels of the candidate ryegrass shattering genes were determined using RT&#x02013;qPCR during different floret and seed developmental stages. Histological analysis of the abscission layer was also conducted. Homologues of seed shattering genes were identified and isolated from perennial ryegrass, and the relative gene expression results suggested that several genes, including <italic>LpqSH1</italic> and <italic>LpSH1</italic>, might have a role in abscission layer formation during seed development. In addition, lignification of the abscission layer may play an important role in the abscission process. A genetic model for seed shattering in perennial ryegrass is suggested and may be useful for directing gene editing towards the production of a reduced-shattering ryegrass.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Perennial ryegrass (<italic>Lolium perenne</italic> L.) is a key pasture grass in many parts of the world.

Ryegrass is reported to be the most valuable plant species in New Zealand, with a $14.5 billion impact on New Zealand&#x02019;s GDP in 2012, due predominantly to perennial ryegrass being a highly valued forage for the livestock industry (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Nixon 2016</xref>). Consequently, the supply of high-quality perennial ryegrass seed is a significant issue for the agronomic sector. However, there are several factors affecting seed yield in this species, including poor pollination and seed set (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Charlesworth 1989</xref>), impact of biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Hampton <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) and large harvest losses (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Jensen 1976</xref>). The primary cause of harvest loss is seed shattering, i.e. the shedding of seed before and during the harvest process (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Elgersma <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>). Seed shattering may lead to a seed yield loss of up to 75 % in grass species including perennial ryegrass (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Simon <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Consequently, seed shattering can result in considerable economic losses.</p><p>Seed shattering is a developmentally programed abscission event, occurring in a specific tissue, the abscission layer. Genes preventing seed shattering were generally dominant in the early progenitors of crops such as rice and sorghum (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Konishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). During domestication, non-shattering homozygous recessive mutant alleles replaced the dominant alleles as a consequence of unconscious selection over millennia (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Konishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). A number of the genes responsible for the seed shattering trait have been identified and cloned from several monocot species.</p><p>In rice, two significant genes implicated in seed shattering, <italic>qSH1</italic> and <italic>SH4</italic>, have been identified. <italic>OsqSH1</italic> (<italic>QTL of seed shattering in chromosome 1</italic>) is reported to be the major shattering-related QTL in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and has the largest effect on the shattering trait, explaining 68.6 % of the total phenotypic variation in the population (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Konishi <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), whereas <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> showed that <italic>SH4</italic>, a QTL on rice chromosome 4, explained 69 % of the total phenotypic variance relating to the seed shattering trait within an F2 population derived from a cross between <italic>O. sativa</italic> ssp. <italic>indica</italic> and the wild annual species, <italic>O. nivara</italic>. Their results showed that <italic>SH4</italic> plays a key role in the formation of the abscission layer during the early stages of flower development. However, as the expression level of <italic>SH4</italic> increased until the late stage of seed maturation, <italic>SH4</italic> may also take part in the activation of the abscission process (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Based on crossing experiments with <italic>qsh1</italic> and <italic>SH4</italic>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Onishi <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> demonstrated that <italic>qSH1</italic> is genetically epistatic to <italic>SH4</italic>.</p><p>
<italic>Shattering Abortion 1</italic> (<italic>OsSHAT1</italic>) gene, which impacts on the differentiation of the seed abscission layer, plays an essential role for seed shattering in rice (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref>. <italic>OsSHAT1</italic> is an AP2 (APETALA2)-type transcription factor, a putative orthologue of <italic>AtAP2</italic> in arabidopsis. Another AP2 gene previously reported to affect seed shattering is the wheat <italic>Q</italic> gene, which has an impact on a range of characters important for domestication, such as glume shape and glume tenacity (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Doebley 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Simons <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Therefore, these two important cereal crops may have analogous mechanisms for the initiation of abscission layers (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>A homologue of <italic>OsqSH1</italic> was identified on chromosome 5 in rice and was named <italic>OsSH5</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). They reported that <italic>OsSH5</italic> was highly expressed in the abscission layer in the pedicels and could enhance the seed shattering trait, but the abscission process still required <italic>OsqSH1</italic>. <italic>OsSH5</italic> was shown to induce another two key genes involved in seed shattering, <italic>OsSHAT1</italic> and <italic>OsSH4</italic>, whose expression was located in the pedicel region of <italic>SH5</italic>-overexpressed lines (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In contrast to <italic>qSH1</italic>, <italic>SH4</italic> and <italic>SHAT1</italic>, which promote abscission layer formation, <italic>SH-H</italic> locates within a 34 kb region of chromosome 7 and acts as a repressor of the seed shattering process in rice (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). <italic>SH-H</italic> is the only recessive shattering gene so far identified in rice.</p><p>In contrast to rice, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Lin <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)</xref> suggested that seed shattering in wild sorghum (<italic>Sorghum virgatum</italic>) appeared to be controlled by a single gene, <italic>SH1</italic>, which encodes a YABBY transcription factor. They further reported that the genomic regions corresponding to <italic>SH1</italic> were conserved among a number of cereals, including rice (<italic>O. sativa</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic>) and sorghum (<italic>S. bicolor</italic>). Functional analysis also indicated that <italic>SH1</italic> could play similar roles in the abscission process in different monocot species such as sorghum, rice and maize.</p><p>Other transcription factors have also been shown to be involved in seed shattering. The <italic>SpWRKY</italic> gene, encoding a WRKY transcription factor in another wild sorghum (<italic>S. propinquum</italic>), may play a role in seed shattering (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). The rice liguleless gene (<italic>OsLG1</italic>) is reported to play a critical role in seed shattering (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Ishii <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). <italic>OsLG1</italic> encodes an SBP (<italic>SQUAMOSA</italic> promoter-binding protein) domain and controls laminar joint and ligule development.</p><p>In contrast to cereal crops, most forage plants, such as perennial ryegrass, are much less domesticated, and have been actively bred for fewer than 100 years (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Stewart 2006</xref>). Therefore, the seed shattering trait is still retained in most of these forage species. As perennial ryegrass and cereal crops belong to the Poaceae (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Jones <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), we hypothesized that homologues of the shattering genes identified in cereal crops may exist in perennial ryegrass and play similar roles in regulating the seed shattering process. In the present work, we carried out a comparative genomics approach to isolate these genes in perennial ryegrass, followed by RT&#x02013;qPCR to reveal the expression profiles of the putative seed shattering genes during floret and seed development. We also conducted morphological and histological analysis of the abscission process in this species. While there were no non-shattering genotypes of perennial ryegrass available in New Zealand with which to compare the expression of the putative shattering genes, the results of this work provide useful information regarding the genetic mechanism of seed shattering in perennial ryegrass and can be used to provide targets for functional analysis and for plant breeders developing reduced shattering lines of ryegrass.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Isolation of putative seed shattering genes in perennial ryegrass</title><p>Candidate target gene sequences of <italic>SH1</italic>, <italic>LG1</italic>, <italic>SH4</italic>, <italic>qSH1</italic>, <italic>SHAT1</italic>, <italic>WRKY</italic> and <italic>Q</italic> from different monocots were obtained from the NCBI database and published articles <bold>[see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"><bold>Supporting Information&#x02014;Table S1</bold></xref><bold>]</bold>.

Other YABBY genes have also been illustrated to have unique functions, for instance, <italic>fasciated</italic> controls carpel number during flower/fruit development in tomato (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Cong <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>); <italic>Drooping Leaf</italic> regulates midrib formation in the leaves and carpel specification in the flowers of rice (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Ohmori <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>) and <italic>OsYAB1</italic> plays a role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels in rice (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Jang <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). YABBY genes contain DNA-binding domains known to maintain the expression of genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and lignin deposition (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref>. Additionally, a YABBY transcription factor, <italic>ObSH3</italic>, is required for abscission layer development during African rice domestication (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Lv <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). Combining previous studies and our gene expression study, we suggest that <italic>LpSH1</italic> plays a critical role in the seed shattering process from abscission layer formation to abscission activation in ryegrass.</p><p>Based on the earlier discussion, we propose a genetic model for seed shattering in perennial ryegrass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). We suggest that the interaction of LpqSH1 with the KNOX protein OSH15 (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) occurs upstream of <italic>LpSH4</italic> and <italic>LpSHAT1</italic>. <italic>LpSH4</italic> and <italic>LpSHAT1</italic> induce the differentiation of the abscission layer in perennial ryegrass. Meanwhile, <italic>LpSH1</italic> could also positively maintain abscission layer formation. It is likely that <italic>LpSH1</italic> continues to have a role during the initiation of abscission, probably by regulating the genes related to lignin deposition (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). SH5 interacting with a KNOX protein (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) could repress lignin biosynthesis and thus inhibit lignin deposition in perennial ryegrass, leading to seed shattering. Additionally, <italic>LpSH5</italic> would maintain <italic>LpSH4</italic> expression leading to degradation of the cell wall to promote abscission through cell wall hydrolytic enzymes. Additionally, <italic>SH4</italic> might have a role in determining grain size and node development (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Genetic model for seed shattering in perennial ryegrass.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ply076f0008"/></fig><p>In conclusion, by using a comparative genomics strategy in combination with a transcriptome data set, we have successfully isolated from perennial ryegrass eight putative seed shattering regulatory genes previously linked to seed shattering in other monocot crop species including rice, sorghum and wheat. Quantitative expression profiles during the shattering time course revealed several genes, particularly <italic>LpSH1</italic>, which could be playing important roles in regulating the seed shattering process in perennial ryegrass. Results of the current work provide useful information relating to the genetic control of seed shattering in ryegrass and provide targets for selection of mutants from TILLING populations or, more directly, for gene editing to reduce seed shattering.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>We thank the New Zealand Foundation for Arable Research for the PhD scholarship for Zeyu FU and for project funding, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31371616) for J.S. and J.Z. </p></sec><sec><title>Contributions by the Authors</title><p>P.E.J. and J.S. developed and oversaw the project; J.S. provided the perennial ryegrass transcriptome data and analysis; Z.F. grew and collected the samples, conducted all the RT-qPCR and histology, and analysed and interpreted the data as part of his PhD research; J.Z. contributed to the data collection in Yantai.
