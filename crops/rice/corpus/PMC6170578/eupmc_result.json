    "Mercury released into the atmosphere from coal combustion is harmful to humans and the environment. Rice husk gasification char (RHGC) is an industrial waste of biomass gasification power generation, which is silver-loaded to develop a novel and efficient sorbent for mercury removal from simulated flue gas. The experiment was carried out in a fixed-bed experimental system. The Hg0 adsorption performance of RHGC was improved significantly after loading silver. Hg0 adsorption capacity and mercury inlet concentration were found to be nonlinear. The adsorption capacity of RHGC decreased with the increase of reaction temperature. SO2 inhibited mercury removal, NO and HCl promoted mercury removal; the Hg0 adsorption capacity in the simulated flue gas was higher than that in pure N2. The silver-loaded rice husk gasification char (SRHGC) could be recycled about five times without significantly losing its removal efficiency. The SRHGC will not only reduce the cost of mercury removal but also save energy and reduce environmental pollution. At the same time, it provides a new way for the resource utilization of RHGC."
