    "A new super-hard rice cultivar, 'Chikushi-kona 85', which was derived from a cross between 'Fukei 2032' and 'EM129', was developed via bulk method breeding. 'Chikushi-kona 85' showed a higher content of resistant starch than the normal non-glutinous rice cultivar, 'Nishihomare', and a higher grain yield than the first super-hard rice cultivar, 'EM10'. The amylopectin chain length of 'Chikushi-kona 85' and its progenitor line 'EM129' was longer than that of 'Nishihomare', and was similar to that of 'EM10'. This suggests that the starch property of 'Chikushi-kona 85' was inherited from 'EM129', which is a mutant line deficient in a starch branching enzyme similar to 'EM10'. Genetic analysis of 'Chikushi-kona 85' crossed with 'Nishihomare' also showed that the starch property of 'Chikushi-kona 85' was regulated by a single recessive gene. Consumption of processed cookies made from 'Chikushi-kona 85' flour showed a distinctive effect in controlling blood sugar levels in comparison to the normal non-glutinous rice cultivar 'Hinohikari'. These results show that 'Chikushi-kona 85' is a novel genetic source to develop new products made of rice, which could reduce calorie intake and contribute to additional health benefits."
