Four-week-old seedlings of both cultivars were grown in large soil volumes in the glasshouse under controlled conditions and then exposed to moderate and extreme drought for 7 days, followed by 3 days of re-watering period. Mature leaves were harvested from plants of each treatment for protein extraction and subsequent complementary shotgun proteomic analyses.

The experiments were carried out in glass-houses with temperature set to 28/22&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C (day/night) and a 12-h photoperiod with the light intensity exceeded 700&#x0202f;&#x000b5;mol&#x0202f;m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> throughout. Plant seedlings were well watered for 40 days. Extreme drought stress was imposed by withholding water for 7 days. For the moderate drought treatment, the amount of water transpired by plants was recorded daily by measuring the weight of pots, and then the plants were watered with &#x000bd; of the water that had transpired. Severely stressed plants (47 days old) were re-watered to field capacity for three days. Thus, five group of triplicate samples were collected at 40 days (control A), 47 days (extreme and moderate drought) and 50 days (recovery and control B). Leaf tissue collected after each treatment was immediately lyophilized.
