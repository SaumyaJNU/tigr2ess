It is an unenveloped, non-covalently closed, bacilliform double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus with a monopartite genome of ~7.2&#x02013;7.8&#x02009;kb encoding three open-reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a small protein of unknown function that is associated with virions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. OFR2 encodes a protein of ~14&#x02009;kDa, which is involved in virion assembly due to the presence of predicted N-terminal coiled-coil domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. ORF3 contains domains associated with movement, the virus capsid, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase, and ribonuclease H functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">BSV was first identified in West Africa in 1958 and is now reported in most banana and plantain growing countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Like other badnaviruses, BSV sequences integrate into the genome of <italic>Musa</italic> spp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. BSV is a complex of different viruses belonging to the pararetroviruses and classified as endogenous pararetroviruses when they are integrated into a host genome. The BSV integrated in the banana host genome are known as endogenous BSV (eBSV).</p><p id="Par5">Banana cultivars are polyploid clones derived from <italic>Musa accuminata</italic> (A genome) or/and <italic>Musa balbisiana</italic> (B genome). The eBSV sequences are mainly integrated in the B genome derived from <italic>M. balbisiana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Many economically important sub-groups of banana, such as plantain (AAB), an important staple food in Africa, contain at least one B genome. Multiple copies of eBSV viral sequences have become integrated as direct and inverted tandem repeats at a single locus in the B genome of the host during viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. When the banana plants are stressed, the eBSV recombines to produce a functional episomal viral genome and infectious viral particles and as a result the plant develops disease symptoms. In vitro culture for propagation and hybridization through conventional breeding may also trigger its activation. Consequently, BSV is considered as a major constraint in banana breeding programs, restricting the use of the diploid progenitor <italic>M. balbisiana</italic> or its derivants carrying a B genome as parents for introgression of desirable agronomic traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It also restricts germplasm movement of genotypes with the B genome worldwide due to this potential activation of eBSV into the episomal infectious form of virus. Therefore, it is crucial to design a strategy to irreversibly silence the latent eBSV in the B genome. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing technology was applied to inactivate eBSV sequences in the host plantain genome. The genome-edited events of plantain Gonja Manjaya were generated with mutations in the targeted sites of integrated eBSV sequences in the host genome. Seventy-five percent (6 out of 8) of the edited events tested remained asymptomatic in comparison to the control non-edited plants under water stress conditions, confirming inhibition of eBSV and reversal of its ability to be converted into infectious viral particles in the edited lines.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Confirmation of presence of eBSV in genome of Gonja Manjaya</title><p id="Par6">Gonja Manjaya, a false horn plantain (AAB genome) commonly grown in East and Central Africa, was initiated from an asymptomatic field plant and used in this study to knockout the integrated sequences of eBSV. The BSV strain Obino l&#x02019;Ewai (BSOLV), is widely distributed among plantain plantations in Africa. BSOLV exhibits in two forms, episomal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, GenBank accession KJ013506) and eBSOLV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, GenBank accession AP009334) integrated in a recombined form at a single locus in the B genome of plantain. The presence of BSOLV or eBSOLV sequences was confirmed in the mother stock of in vitro plantlets by PCR analysis using the three different primer pairs (P1&#x02013;P3) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), which amplify both the endogenous and episomal forms of the virus. The presence of the episomal form of BSOLV was ruled out by PCR analysis using primer pair P4 that specifically amplifies BSOLV but not the integrated eBSOLV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The P4 primer pair (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) binds in the ORF3 region of BSOLV and generates a 1336&#x02009;bp fragment in the presence of the replicating viral genome. This primer pair also binds to eBSOLV, but the position and orientation of the two primers&#x02019; binding precludes PCR amplification (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The amplified fragment diagnostic for the episomal BSOLV was also observed in the symptomatic plants of plantain Agbagba, collected from the field as positive controls (PC1&#x02013;2) and a symptomatic glasshouse plant of Gonja Manjaya (PC3). However, no amplification was observed in any of the in vitro Gonja Manjaya plantlets, similar to the asymptomatic control plant of Cavendish Williams (AAA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of <italic>banana streak virus</italic> (BSV) strain Obino l&#x02019;Ewai (BSOLV) and molecular analysis of Gonja Manjaya plants. <bold>a</bold> Episomal BSOLV showing three open-reading frames (ORF) and gene annotation in ORF3 (GenBank accession KJ013506).

There is only one infectious allele of eBSOLV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. BSOLV sequences are duplicated in the same or opposite direction resulting in several copies of ORFs (either complete or partial) within the integrated eBSOLV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As a result of these duplications, each guide (S1&#x02013;S3) has three targets in the BSOLV sequences integrated in the plant genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">Twenty independent transgenic events (1, 4, 7, 17, 29, 30, 33, 36, 48, 53, 66, 72, 76, 78, 81, 85, 87, 94, 97, and 100), confirmed for the presence of the <italic>Cas9</italic> gene, were analyzed for a shift in the size of PCR amplicons as an indication for mutations in target sites S1 and S2. PCR analysis was performed using primer pair P1 flanking the gRNA1 (in S1 targets) and gRNA2 (in S2 targets) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). The amplicons of several of these independently derived events showed a predicted band shift of 197&#x02009;bp, suggesting deletions in the region between S1 and S2 as expected when Cas9 cuts both target sites simultaneously (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Seven (36, 66, 81, 85, 87, 94, and 97) out of 20 events showed shorter amplicons (band shift by 197&#x02009;bp) in addition to amplicons similar in size to those of wild type control plants suggesting that they might be heterozygous for mutations in all the copies of target sites S1 and S2. Two events (81 and 85) showed a third amplicon with a smaller deletion indicating these plants contained additional genome rearrangements. Two other events (48 and 76) had only the smaller amplicons suggesting all target sites might have the same mutation, while the remaining nine events (1, 4, 7, 17, 29, 53, 72, 78, and 100) showed amplicons similar to the wild type control plant (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref>), indicating that they might have no indels or small indels.</p><p id="Par14">A T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay was performed to check for the presence of small indels in the nine transgenic events (1, 4, 7, 17, 29, 53, 72, 78, and 100), which did not show any shift in the size of amplicon compared with the wild type control. T7E1-digested fragments were detected in all the events except for events 7 and 78, confirming the mutated sites in these events (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">All the 20 independent events (1, 4, 7, 17, 29, 30, 33, 36, 48, 53, 66, 72, 76, 78, 81, 85, 87, 94, 97, and 100) tested by PCR analysis were further analyzed for targeted mutations by sequencing of target sites S1 and S2. The PCR products amplified using P1 primers were purified and cloned, and 10 individual clones per event sequenced. Sequencing of the cloned PCR products further confirmed the targeted mutations in all the edited events except for 3 events (7, 33, and 78) confirming a mutation efficiency of 85% in the targeted site S1 and S2 of transgenic plants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Simultaneous cutting at S1 and S2 site was apparently repaired to generate the deletion of 198 nucleotides in a coding region, eliminating 66 codons. In other events (1, 4, 17, 29, 30, and 53), the deletions were smaller. Events 17 and 94 showed small deletions at both target sites, indicating Cas9 cleavage and independent mutagenic repair events at two nearby target sites in the same eBSOLV.

Only one nucleotide replacement was observed in event 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Genetic improvement of banana by conventional breeding is key for the development of improved varieties with disease and pest resistance and higher yields. BSV is one of the major challenges in banana breeding and dissemination of plantain hybrids due to the presence of integrated eBSV in the B genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These proviruses can be activated into the infectious episomal BSV by various stress conditions. Thus, major epidemics caused by BSV are not due to natural transmission through mealy bugs or through use of infected planting materials, but, rather due to activation of eBSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> under stress conditions, such as in vitro propagation, hybridization or/and unfavorable conditions like water and temperature stress. As a result, BSV has become a hurdle to overcome in plantain breeding. Breeders cannot use diploid <italic>M. balbisiana</italic> (BB) in breeding programs, even though it has good attributes like hardiness, strong root system, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, it is necessary to make the B genome of banana free of the activatable sequences of eBSV. With this in mind, in this study we knocked out the integrated eBSV by targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9.</p><p id="Par27">CRISPR-mediated genome editing for plant virus resistance is mainly reported for ssDNA viruses like geminiviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and ssRNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. CRISPR/Cas9 technology can also be applied to either dsDNA viruses or retroviruses that have dsDNA as part of their life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Currently, this has not been demonstrated for any plant viruses, however, application of CRISPR/Cas9 to interrupt both episomal and integrated dsDNA viruses has been demonstrated in many human viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. HIV is a retrovirus that integrates its viral DNA into the host DNA and has potential to reactivate causing the disease, HIV-AIDS.

Similarly, in this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the integrated dsDNA of BSV from the banana genome using gRNAs targeting multiple repeats of all the three ORFs of BSV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Our results showed high mutation efficiency of 95% in the targeted sites (S1&#x02013;S3) using multiple gRNAs, which is in agreement with a recent study in which 100% editing frequency was reported for banana using a polycistronic gRNA plasmid construct targeting the <italic>PDS</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our study, the frequency of mutations differed between the target sites. About 85% of events (17/20) showed indels in the S1 and S2 target sites and 59% of these mutants showed big deletions of 198&#x02009;bp as a result of simultaneous cleavage of both target sites by Cas9.

Our results showed very low potential off-target site mutations indicating that CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutagenesis in banana is precise and efficient.</p><p id="Par32">The evaluation of eight edited events under water stress conditions in the glasshouse showed BSV symptoms in only two events, whereas the other six events remained asymptomatic. PCR and qPCR analysis of these plants confirmed the activation of eBSOLV into infectious episomal BSOLV in the two symptomatic-edited events and stressed control wild type plants, whereas no infectious virus was detected in the six asymptomatic-edited events. The qPCR assay is reported to be specific for detection of episomal BSOLV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">The asymptomatic events have indels in all the three ORFs, whereas symptomatic events had deletions only in ORF1 and ORF2. This result suggests that ORF3, encoding essential proteins, such as movement protein, coat protein, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase, and ribonuclease H, may play a crucial role in symptom development. ORF3 encodes a polyprotein, which is cleaved post-translationally by aspartic protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> into functional versions of each of the ORF3-encoded proteins. In this study, the mutations created in the aspartic protease gene should have disrupted the functions of the protease and thus, the functions of other ORF3 genes as well. However, there is need for multiple knockouts in all three ORFs to completely prevent activation of eBSV as indels only in one ORF may result in partial inactivation and might allow viral escape. Although the edited plants with only mutations in the ORF3 region were not tested for activation of eBSOLV in this study, plants with mutations only in ORF3 may also exhibit partial inactivation of the virus as ORF2 encodes for a protein that is involved in virion assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, it appears that simultaneous generation of mutations in all three ORFs is an important strategy for completely inactivating the provirus and preventing the occurrence of symptoms. Indeed, regarding HIV-1, a retrovirus whose provirus is similar to eBSV, studies have demonstrated the strong suppression of HIV-1 using a multiplex approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">BSV is a complicated virus and mechanisms for its integration, activation, and subsequent episomal infection are still largely unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. There is only one infectious allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> of eBSOLV integrated in the chromosome 1 of B genome of Gonja Manjaya. However, three or more copies (complete or partial) of each ORF were present either in the same or opposite orientation within the eBSOLV sequences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">It is interesting that a few events showing indels in some clones and wild type sequence in other clones showed a knockout phenotype with no BSV symptom development under stress conditions. Although this triploid genome carries only a single copy of the integrated sequence, that integrated sequence carries three copies of each target, in various orientations. The symptom-free plants may carry mutations copies of the target that are essential for production of a functional episomal virus. Further analysis of these plants may enable us to distinguish between essential and disposable copies of the target site.</p><p id="Par36">In summary, we have successfully applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the integrated sequence of eBSOLV in plantain cultivar Gonja Manjaya. Our results also demonstrated that multiplexing of CRISPR/Cas9 technology is very efficient in creating precise deletions in banana. Although preliminary results showed stable mutations and silencing of the reactivation of eBSOLV, more robust evaluation of promising edited plants in the field for several generations and with new BSV infections, due to natural transmission through mealy bugs in the field conditions, is required.</p><p id="Par37">This is the first report&#x000a0;to our knowledge to demonstrate the knockout of integrated endogenous DNA sequences of the pararetrovirus in a host plant genome.
