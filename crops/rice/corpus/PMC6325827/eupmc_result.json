    "BACKGROUND:Maonan nationality is a relatively conservative and isolated minority in the Southwest of China. Little is known about the association of endothelial lipase gene (LIPG) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and serum lipid levels in the Chinese populations. METHODS:A total of 1280 subjects of Maonan nationality and 1218 participants of Han nationality were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized samples. Genotypes of the four LIPG SNPs were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS:Several SNPs were associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (rs3813082, rs2000813 and rs2097055) in the both ethnic groups; total cholesterol and apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 (rs2000813) in Han nationality; and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ApoB, triglyceride (rs2097055) and ApoA1 (rs3819166) in Maonan minority (P < 0.0125 for all after Bonferroni correction). The commonest haplotype was rs3813082T-rs2000813C-rs2097055T-rs3819166A (Han, 44.2% and Maonan, 48.7%). The frequencies of the T-C-T-A, T-C-T-G, T-T-C-G and G-T-C-G haplotypes were different between the Maonan and Han populations (P < 0.05-0.001). The associations between haplotypes and dyslipidemia were also different in the Han and/or Maonan populations (P < 0.05-0.001). CONCLUSIONS:The differences in serum lipid profiles between the two ethnic groups might partly be attributed to these LIPG SNPs, their haplotypes and gene-environmental interactions. TRIAL REGISTRATION:Retrospectively registered."
