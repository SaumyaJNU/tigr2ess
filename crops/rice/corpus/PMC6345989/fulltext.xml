Here, the effect of exogenous application of GABA in the determined optimal concentration was performed on seedlings of two maize cultivars under waterlogging treatments initiated at 3-leaf (V3) and 5-leaf stages (V5) in repeated experiments in 2016 and 2017. Chloroplast ultrastructure, photosynthesis, antioxidant capacity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the leaves were examined and compared with the corresponding values under normal soil water treatment (CK) and waterlogging treatment (WL). Compared with WL treatment, application of GABA significantly increased aboveground and root dry matter by 19.0% and 61.0%, promoted photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content by 19.8% and 36.0%, increased the number of grana per chloroplast by 36.0%, fortified antioxidants (SOD, POD, CAT, GR, APX, V<sub>C</sub>) activities by 14.7&#x02013;42.7%, and reduced the content of MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> by 30.5%, 32.5%, and 21.8%, respectively (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Like other crops, maize is more sensitive to waterlogging, particularly at the seedling stage, which is considered one of the major threats to the production of this crop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the tropical and subtropical region of China, most rainfall occurs in the maize growing season and excessive rainfall and flooding has caused heavy loss of crop growth and yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Global climate change contributes to an increasingly unpredictable rain pattern and is causing flooding that is expected to increase crop yield losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Globally, it is estimated that 12% of cultivated areas are affected by waterlogging, resulting in a 20% decrease in crop production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and increasing annual losses to billions of dollars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Waterlogging depletes the oxygen in soil because of slow diffusion and high consumption by plant roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. When maize crop is subjected to waterlogging, stomatal closure and declines in photosynthetic rates are common responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Excessive soil moisture limits plant growth by altering morphological, physiological, and anatomical mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Waterlogging decreases superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities, causing damage to the protective enzyme system. Waterlogging also regulates the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, resulting in membrane deterioration, leaf chlorosis, and increased leaf senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Chloroplasts are the major sites for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) under environmental stress conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Accumulation of excessive ROS could lead to oxidation of biomolecules, and such processes trigger oxidative damages to proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids and peroxidation of thylakoid membrane lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Previous researchers showed that waterlogging stress changed the shape and internal structure of chloroplasts and their volume, and also damage the structure and integrity of cell membrane and mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The physiological reaction to waterlogging results in reduced leaf area, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and destruction of chloroplast ultrastructure in maize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The structure of mesophyll cell and chloroplast morphology is an essential component of photosynthesis and plays a key role in determining photosynthetic assimilation capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The morphology and ultrastructure of chloroplasts directly affects photosynthesis and significantly reduces the dry matter accumulation and yield of maize crop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Plant growth regulators play an important role in modulating plant physiological responses to adapt to an unfavorable environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and their exogenous application is an effective way to improve crop tolerance to waterlogging stress. Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important four- carbon, non-protein amino acid present in animals, plants, and other organisms, and is involved in certain physio-biochemical functions for the regulation of plant growth and stress tolerance, such as signaling, regulation of redox status, sustenance of cytosolic pH, osmotic pressure, C and N metabolism, and C-N fluxes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Current studies indicate that GABA responds rapidly to abiotic stresses such as waterlogging, salt stress, heat shock, low temperature, mechanical stimulation, and plant hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, exogenous application of GABA regulates the gene expressions of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> uptake and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport (<italic>BnNrt2</italic>) in the <italic>Brassica napus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and <italic>14-3-3</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that gene regulation in GABA application is associated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ethylene production in the roots of caragana<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. GABA plays a critical role in alleviating oxidative damage through activation of the antioxidant enzymes, which constitute a defense system against ROS in wheat plants under waterlogging stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, application of exogenous GABA imparts partial protection from heat stress to rice seedlings by improving leaf turgor and up-regulating the expression of osmoprotectants and antioxidants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Several other studies have indicated that the exogenous application of GABA promotes photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthetic activities, enzymatic and non-enzymatic responses, and membrane stabilization in different crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Although endogenous GABA levels in plants are very low, it is produced rapidly by plants under stressful conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">However, the adaptation of plants under abiotic stress depends on comprehensive responses based on physiological and biochemical changes, and the palliative effects of GABA on waterlogging stress still has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study the exogenous application of GABA was initiated under waterlogging conditions at the third leaf stage (V3) and fifth leaf stage (V5), respectively, for two popular hybrid maize varieties in China: Zhengdan-958 (ZD-958) and Xing Ken-6 (XK-6). Plant growth responses and physiological adaptive mechanisms were evaluated; specifically, leaf gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll content, enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, lipid peroxides and ROIs- accumulation, and chloroplast ultrastructure were examined. Our findings here will improve our understanding of the adaptation, survival, and tolerance of maize under waterlogging stress and will help to improve the growth status for higher yields under natural conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GABA application increased the GABA content in leaves under waterlogging stress</title><p id="Par6">As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, in comparison with CK treatment, GABA content in the leaves at V5 stage under the WL treatment was significantly increased, by 18.6% in XK-6 cultivar and 31.3% in ZD-958 cultivars in 2016 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05); however, slight increases in GABA content in the leaves at V3 stages under WL treatment were observed.

Moreover, we found that maize seedlings at the V5 stage had a stronger ability to produce GABA and absorb exogenous GABA than the plants at V3 stages under waterlogging stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>); this might be one of the reasons that maize plants at the V5 stage had a greater ability to tolerate waterlogging stress, shown by better growth attributes in these plants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">It has been reported that GABA can ameliorate plant growth under different abiotic stress conditions in maize, rice, brassica, and wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. However, GABA&#x02019;s role in plants has remained unclear, while its role as a neurotransmitter in animal cells is well recognized.

However, exogenous GABA application improved these plant growth attributes when plants were subjected to waterlogging stress (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Exogenous GABA application on leaves significantly increased the plant height and leaf area of waterlogging-treated Pakchio seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Also, exogenous GABA was reported to increase the dry weight of maize under hypoxia stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In our study, compared with WL treatment, GABA application improved the tolerance of maize seedling to waterlogging stress, showing that GABA application increased the plant height, leaf area, and biomass at two treated growth stages of maize cultivars XK-6 and ZD-958 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Previously, studies found that GABA-induced improvement in many plant species could be due to improved photosynthetic activities, relative water content, osmolyte accumulation, leaf turgor, and other related physio-metabolical mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. GABA application might have improved the maize seedlings&#x02019; growth by inciting cell elongation and division and/or by maintaining metabolic balance within plant tissues. The results of the current study further confirm the beneficial effects of GABA application in maize under waterlogging conditions.

Nevertheless, some other sources, such as XOD and MAO, also contribute to an active production of ROIs under abiotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The MAO, a flavoprotein localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of aromatic amines and produces a large quantity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which ultimately contributes to an increase in the steady state concentrations of ROIs within the plant cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

However, MAO and XOD activities were significantly lowered in plant leaves treated with the GABA application (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which might have caused the down-regulation of ROIs accumulation and oxidative stress in maize seedlings (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Previous studies reported that the SOD, APX, POD and GR enzymes of the plant antioxidative defense system were triggered under water stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, exogenous GABA application significantly improved the activities of these five antioxidative enzymes at both stages of two varieties in two years compared with CK and WL treatments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Increased activity of antioxidant enzymes in maize seedlings under GABA application is in agreement with previous studies on waterlogging stress in wheat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that exogenous GABA application protected maize seedlings from oxidative stress caused by excessive water through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, decreasing ROI levels, and activating antioxidant enzyme defense systems (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Several studies have documented that exogenous GABA stimulates activities of antioxidant enzymes and reduces oxidative stress under different environmental stressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

However, SOD and POD acted against ROIs in GABA-treated maize seedlings to protect membrane damage, showing that GABA can potentially maintain cell integrity.

Further research needs to be conducted to understand the molecular mechanism by which GABA regulates these antioxidant enzymes.</p><p id="Par21">Similar to plant growth attributes, photosynthesis is one of the primary processes affected by waterlogging stress. Leaf gas exchange parameters of maize seedlings at V3 and V5 stages of two varieties in two years were significantly hindered by waterlogging stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results are in agreement with findings from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

Nevertheless, application of GABA alleviated waterlogging stress on gas exchanges parameters in most experimental conditions in this study, when compared with WL treatment in both maize cultivars (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our results showed that exogenous application of GABA on maize leaves after waterlogging could potentially retard declines in leaf chlorophyll content caused by waterlogging stress, resulting in the enhancement of photosynthetic characteristics (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Enhancements of photosynthetic characteristics in response to GABA application on leaves have also been observed in Pakchio seedlings under waterlogging stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and pepper seedlings under low light stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Exogenous GABA application was further reported to enhance the photochemical efficiency of PSII in muskmelon seedlings under hypoxia stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

However, GABA application obviously increased the number of chloroplasts and grana compared with the waterlogging treatment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
