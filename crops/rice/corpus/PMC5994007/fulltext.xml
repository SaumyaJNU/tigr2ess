Approximately 70% of global cultivated land suffers from P deficiency, and it has recently been estimated that worldwide P resources will be exhausted by the end of this century, increasing the demand for crops more efficient in their P usage. A greater understanding of how plants are able to maintain yield with lower P inputs is, therefore, highly desirable to both breeders and farmers. Here, we clone the wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) homologue of the rice <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene (<italic>OsPSTOL</italic>), and characterize its role in phosphate nutrition plus other agronomically important traits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2"><italic>TaPSTOL</italic> is a single copy gene located on the short arm of chromosome 5A, encoding a putative kinase protein, and shares a high level of sequence similarity to <italic>OsPSTOL</italic>. We re-sequenced <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> from 24 different wheat accessions and (3) three <italic>T. durum</italic> varieties. No sequence differences were detected in 26 of the accessions, whereas two indels were identified in the promoter region of one of the durum wheats. We characterised the expression of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> under different P concentrations and demonstrated that the promoter was induced in root tips and hairs under P limiting conditions. Overexpression and RNAi silencing of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> in transgenic wheat lines showed that there was a significant effect upon root biomass, flowering time independent of P treatment, tiller number and seed yield, correlating with the expression of TaPSTOL. However this did not increase PUE as elevated P concentration in the grain did not correspond to increased yields.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Manipulation of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> expression in wheat shows it is responsible for many of the previously described phenotypic advantages as <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> except yield.

Analysis of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> sequences from a broad selection of wheat varieties, encompassing 91% of the genetic diversity in UK bread wheat, showed that there is very little genetic variation in this gene, which would suggest that this locus may have been under high selection pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12870-018-1331-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Phosphate</kwd><kwd>PSTOL</kwd><kwd>Wheat</kwd><kwd>P</kwd><kwd>Seed size</kwd><kwd>Seed number</kwd><kwd>Flowering time</kwd><kwd>PUE</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient that is required for all major developmental processes in plants and is considered to be one of the most limiting plant nutrients to global agricultural production. Approximately 70% of global cultivated land suffers from phosphate deficiency, making research into phosphate nutrition a priority for both scientists and farmers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Phosphate is usually taken up in the orthophosphate forms (P<sub>i</sub>) which are available at low concentrations in the soil solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This low availability can be compounded by the soil chemistry in which soils high in clay can bind the P<sub>i</sub> requiring large amounts of fertilizer to be applied to maintain high yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To compound the problem of P limiting growth and yield, recent estimates suggest that only 20&#x02013;30% of the inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) added to fields by farmers is assimilated by plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An increased understanding of how plants use P<sub>i</sub> and the current inefficiency of P<sub>i</sub> assimilation would be of economic benefit to farmers and also potentially alleviate environmental problems resulting from large scale agricultural production. Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum L.</italic>) is one of the most important crops worldwide and grown on more than 240 million hectares in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. P is one of the three most important nutrients for growth and yield improvement in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore an improvement in phosphate use efficiency (PUE) in wheat could potentially have a large global impact over 200 million hectares.</p><p id="Par21">Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which different plant species adapt to low-phosphate stress, the regulation and expression of phosphorus metabolism genes and alleles to deal with phosphate limitation, have enabled the design of more effective breeding strategies to produce highly phosphate efficient crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A number of the underlying genes involved in the response of plants to low P are highly conserved and play similar roles in a number of diverse plant species including both model system and crop species. Thus, a greater understanding of the pathways involved in phosphate acquisition and signalling will allow breeders and plant molecular biologists to develop more efficient crops. Identification of these conserved pathways and genes from model organisms, and the subsequent transfer of this knowledge to crop species, would therefore allow farmers to optimize fertilizer use, resulting in increased food production efficiency with lower environmental cost.</p><p id="Par22">One such locus which is believed to be important is the recent identification of the PUP1 locus from rice which contains a putative kinase gene called <underline>P</underline>hosphate <underline>S</underline>tarvation <underline>Tol</underline>erance 1 (PSTOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PUP1 locus was originally identified in an upland variety of rice, Kasalath, yet is absent from most rice cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Rice varieties which have this genomic introgression containing the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene, show increased biomass, increased root growth, increased tiller number and yield increases of up to 30% when grown under low P conditions whereas no deleterious consequences were seen when grown under normal soil fertility conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The identification of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> and its role in helping rice tolerate low P conditions has led to the belief that we can engineer PUE into many crop species using translational science from gains in other model species.</p><p id="Par23">Others have identified homologous <italic>PSTOL</italic>-like genes in both maize and sorghum, based upon QTL analysis and sequence homology. Further evidence of the role of PSTOL-like genes in PUE has been supported through QTL mapping rather than direct molecular characterization of candidate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Criteria to identify other potential PSTOL like genes has included identification of protein domains such as ATP kinase domains and on DNA sequence conservation meeting certain bioinformatic cut-offs for genes underlying these QTL. However some of these homologues appear to have differences in their gene structure such as number and length of introns and UTRs. Despite the lack of a highly conserved gene in most plant species, it is critical to understand whether other PSTOL genes exist in other important crop species and if they can be exploited.</p><p id="Par24">Our study identifies a putative wheat PSTOL gene (<italic>TaPSTOL</italic>) and characterizes its role in PUE and other phenotypes of agronomic importance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Gene identification</title><p id="Par25">The <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> coding sequence from EMBL (AB458444.1) was used as a query for BLAST searches of the wheat genome (IWGSC 2014) and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases in ensembl, GenBank, Komugi and URGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

The second best BLASTp hit to OsPSTOL in the wheat genome is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 3B, which shared only 54% amino acid identity suggesting that three sub-genome specific homologues were not present in wheat. A putative phosphate starvation activation domain thought to be bound by PHR1, also known as a P1BS binding site, was identified at &#x02212;&#x02009;1156 to &#x02212;&#x02009;1149&#x000a0;bp in the predicted promoter region of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Here we set out to identify and characterize the wheat homologue of <italic>OsPSTOL</italic>, which we denote as <italic>TaPSTOL</italic>, and compare the effect of manipulating its expression on a number of agronomic traits both under compost and low P conditions. The rice gene <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> has been shown to confer phenotypes beneficial to growth on P limiting soils, including increased grain yield, root and shoot biomass and increased tillering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our data indicates that many of these PSTOL associated phenotypes are conserved between rice and wheat, including altered root growth under low P conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), increased P content in the grain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>), and increased tiller number (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). There are, however, subtle differences as to when these phenotypes are exhibited in wheat as compared to rice; for instance, the increased tillering phenotype in wheat was only observed in plants grown in compost, whereas in rice, it was also found under P limiting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These differences in the conditions under which the increase in tillering occurs, might be a result of the stringent P limiting conditions in which the plants were grown in sand or the compost system used here to represent a replete P substrate. They could also be due to inherent differences between the two crop species, or the genetic background in which the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene was studied in both rice and wheat. These differences are worthy of further study to identify the underlying mechanism of the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene in both species and how <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> contributes to the regulation of tillering.</p><p id="Par51">While many of the observed rice <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> mediated phenotypes were mirrored in wheat, further supporting the conserved nature of the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene, changes in biomass and yield were not observed. This might be due the choice of germplasm used to test the effect of P efficiency in wheat or the P levels chosen might be too limiting or too generous to see the effects described in rice. There is currently no published data on P efficiency in the variety Fielder, but other work has suggested that natural variation in P efficiency does exist in wheat and this may alter the effect of TaPSTOL on P efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] within a specific variety. Recent findings in rice suggest that plants which contain the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene are not the most efficient under low P conditions, which suggests that other genetic loci may play a greater role in increasing P efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further work in both rice and wheat is required to further understand the processes by which P efficiency is increased, and the role played by <italic>PSTOL</italic> in these differences. While we found <italic>PSTOL</italic> mediated phenotypic effects in common between rice and wheat, our findings also highlight that the need for more understanding of how <italic>PSTOL</italic> genes, and their interactions with other genetic loci, may make crops more efficient under P limiting conditions.</p><p id="Par52">We also identified two phenotypes associated with the <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> locus which were not observed in rice, showing that TaPSTOL modulates wheat flowering time and seed size. The timing of flowering is of great agronomic importance, as it entrains fertilization and seed set with favourable environmental conditions, thus helping farmers reach full yield potential in target agricultural environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Seed size is also an important component to driving yield gains, and we can now add another locus to those previously described as factors influencing grain size in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is interesting that the lack of genetic diversity at <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> in most of the wheat lines tested suggests that this gene may not have been found by traditional QTL mapping in most UK varieties, as no variation exists to be exploited in a mapping population. The lack of variation seen in the wheat cultivars tested, point to this region as having been under strong selection pressure. The majority of these bread wheat varieties originated from the UK, however additional varieties from Europe, USA and China were also included, yet did not show any variation at this locus. Only when the search is extended to the distantly related dicoccoides accessions, which originated from Israel, is some limited variation observed within <italic>TaPSTOL</italic>, limited to the promoter region. This finding is in contrast to <italic>OsPSTOL</italic> in rice where natural variation is found across species from a number of different continents in both the promoter and coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The lack of DNA sequence variation might also be a consequence of a single <italic>PSTOL</italic> homoeologue present in the hexaploid wheat genome, located on chromosome 5A. Estimates for the number of genes present as just a single homoeologue in the hexaploid wheat genome are estimated to be in the range 3 to11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Finally alteration of the expression of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> led to changes in PUE as a decrease in yield and increase in P concentration when grown under P limiting conditions led to lower PUE scores for the over expression of <italic>TaPSTOL</italic> but not for the RNAi lines<italic>.</italic> As a positive increase in yield did not occur with the over expression of TaPSTOL to compensate for the increased P found in the grain, the PUE score was significantly lowered. This was not the case for the OsPSTOL where both an increase in yield along with an increase in P concentration of the tissues were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This difference in rice versus wheat might be due to some other part of the signalling cascade needing to be identified and combined with increased <italic>PSTOL</italic> expression to help drive the yield increases under limiting P growth conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">We have identified and characterized the <italic>PSTOL</italic> gene in wheat and demonstrated that it controls a number of agronomic characteristics important to breeders and farmers, including altering root growth under P deficiency conditions and increased P content in the grain.
