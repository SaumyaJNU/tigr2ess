A sharp decrease in spikelet fertility was found in the Nipponbare (NPB) and its mutant High temperature susceptible (HTS) under heat stress, but the stress-induced spikelet sterility was reversed by 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), especially the HTS. Under heat stress, the pollen tubes of NPB were visible in ovule, while those of HTS were invisible. However, we found the pollen tubes in ovule when sprayed with NAA. During this process, a significant increase in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was found in the pistil of heat-stressed NPB, while in heat-stressed HTS they were obviously decreased. Additionally, the peroxidase (POD) activity in pistil of NPB was significantly decreased by heat stress, whereas there was no difference between the heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed pistils of HTS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">It was concluded that the enhancement of heat tolerance in plants by NAA was achieved through the increase of the levels of auxins, which prevented the inhibition of pollen tube elongation in pistil, and the crosstalk between auxins and ROS, which might be involved in this process.

It has been suggested that, at least in the cases of wheat, maize, rice and barley, a negative correlation exists between worldwide crop yields and increased temperatures (Reilly and Fuglie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1998</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2012</xref>; Karunaratne and Wheeler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>). For these crops, recent climate warming has resulted in annual combined loss of about megatons (Mt) of products (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>; Challinor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). Rice plants are most sensitive to high temperature during the flowering stage (Satake and Yoshida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1978</xref>). High temperature at this stage significantly decreases spikelet sterility in rice, or can even lead to no harvest (Satake and Yoshida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1978</xref>; Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>), which can be mainly ascribed to inhibitions of anther dehiscence, pollen sterility and failed germination on the stigma (Jagadish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; Sebastian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>). In addition, cessation of pollen tube elongation in the pistil is another important factor causing pollination failure under heat stress (Karapanos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>; Snider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>), which has seldom been previously documented.</p><p id="Par14">Pollen tube elongation is a key step for successful pollination in plants, including rice, during which the respiration rate, carbohydrate and protein metabolism and phytohormone production are clearly increased to provide the energy (Taylor and Hepler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1997</xref>; Kovaleva et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2010</xref>; Selinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>). These dramatic metabolism activities in pollinated pistil have been reported in relation to auxin, which are beneficial for competing for nutrients, sugars and water (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1988</xref>). Also, as one of the most important hormones, auxins play critical roles in promoting cell elongation and division and pollen development (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; Cecchetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Sakata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>), as well as the reproductive tissues, including pollen, which contain high concentrations of auxins (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>; Cecchetti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Chen and Zhao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). Moreover, since exogenous auxins can stimulate in vitro pollen tube growth (Chen and Zhao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2008</xref>), it can be assumed that auxin signaling may play a potential role in regulating the elongation of pollen tubes. This finding was supported by studies on the pollen-specific auxin efflux carrier <italic>PIN8</italic> indicating that its mutant pollen had a reduced germination ratio compared to wild-type, whereas <italic>PIN8</italic> overexpression in pollen increased the resistance of pollen tube elongation to 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) (Ding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). The results of Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>) indicated that auxin regulated the pollen tube elongation and its direction by secreting vesicles in pollen tube, thus enhancing PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase of mitochondria, as well as changing the pectin and cellulose microfibrils in the pollen tube wall. Additionally, the highest level of auxin was found in the pistil when the pollen is germinating, and afterwards significantly decreased levels were found as the tube grew through this section (Chen and Zhao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">The phytohormone auxin plays a prominent role in regulating acclimation to high temperature in plants, and high temperature boosts the level of free auxin (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>; Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>; Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, a moderately high temperature stimulates the elongation of hypocotyls by activation of auxin biosynthesis (Gray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). The results of Franklin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>) indicated that increase levels of auxin were required in an adaptive response to heat stress. However, in the developing anthers of barley and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, endogenous auxin levels significantly decreased under heat stress leading to spikelet sterility, and exogenous auxin reversed this damage, suggesting that auxin can alleviate heat-damage in reproductive organs (Sakata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). In rice, significantly decreased auxin levels were found in spikelets under heat stress, resulting in abnormal floret differentiation and increase in spikelet degradation (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015b</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>). However, the role of auxin in pollen tube elongation under heat stress has seldom been previously reported. It is reported that pollen tube growth in the styles is strongly inhibited by temperature above 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and the yield of cotton decreased due to the effect of high temperature during floral bud (square) development (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Accordingly, we inferred that changes in auxin level might be involved in abnormal pollen tube growth in the pistil of rice under heat stress, as the auxin levels in the pistil of a cultivar with heat sensitive genotype were significantly decreased under heat stress, and thus the spikelet sterility was significantly increased. Additionally, pretreatment of the flowering plants with NAA could prevent spikelet sterility caused by high temperature stress, suggesting that heat stress-induced disruption of auxin metabolism might be the main factor leading to spikelet sterility by inhibiting pollen tube growth. In this experiment, two rice genotypes with different heat tolerance were subjected to heat stress at anthesis pretreated with NAA and the auxin synthesis inhibitor L-aminooxyphenylpropionic acid (AOPP) (Soeno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>) to evaluate the role of auxin in pollen tube growth in the pistil and spikelet fertility under heat stress, as well as its underlying mechanism. Also, the relationships among auxin, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidase (POD) involved in pollen tube growth in the pistil under heat stress will be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p id="Par16">Two rice genotypes, namely the Nipponbare (NPB) and its mutant high-temperature susceptible (HTS) genotypes, were used in this study. The HTS semi-rolled leaf mutant was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-induced japonica rice NPB mutant bank. This mutant has been selfed for more than nine generations and the rolled-leaf phenotype has been stably expressed in greenhouse and field conditions in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province China. Rice plants were sown in pots of 10&#x000a0;cm radius and 20&#x000a0;cm height at the China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China. The rice seeds were soaked in running water for 48&#x000a0;h, then sprout at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h. About 20 grains were sown in each pot, and then thinned to four plants when the fifth leaf was emerging. The pots were filled with 7.5&#x000a0;kg of paddy soil. The rice plants were cultivated in the greenhouse with an automatic temperature control system to control the temperature until anthesis (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>), using the following environmental conditions: 12/12&#x000a0;h photoperiod with natural sunlight, temperature of 30/24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, relative humidity of 70/80%, day/night, respectively.

Similar results were observed in this study indicating that heat stress caused a sharp decrease in spikelet fertility in these two genotypes compared with their respective control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the extent of fertility reduction effect was found to be dependent on the time of exposure of the flowering spikelet to heat stress (Snider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). An evidently higher decrease in spikelet fertility was observed with the 0&#x02013;2 HAF treatment than that with the 2&#x02013;4 HAF treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), suggesting that the former was the more sensitive to heat stress. The rice pollen is germinated on the stigma within 2&#x000a0;min of pollination, and the tubes reach the ovule after 50&#x000a0;min (Pan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>). High temperature stress at this stage not only inhibits the anther dehiscence and pollen germination on the stigma, but also interrupts the pollen tube elongation in the pistils, which has seldom been previously reported (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Accordingly, heat stress may inhibit the development of fertilized ovum, rather than pollen tube elongation when the spikelets are subjected to heat stress for about 2&#x000a0;h after flowering.</p><p id="Par32">The cessation of pollen tube growth caused by heat stress might be another important factor resulting in spikelet sterility in rice, especially in high temperature susceptible cultivars, such as the HTS cultivar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Since the flowering spikelets subjected to heat stress were about 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min later, the spikelet sterility caused by heat stress was due to cessation of pollen tube elongation in the pistil, rather than poor anther dehiscence or lower pollen germination on the stigma (Karapanos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>; Rang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Djanaguiraman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>; Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Indeed, there was no obvious difference in pollen number and pollen germination on the stigma of rice among all the treatments in both genotypes. However, while the pollen tube was invisible in the ovary and ovule of HTS sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O under heat stress, that of NPB was clearly visible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Noteworthy, the cessation of pollen tube growth caused by heat stress in the ovary was reversed by NAA, as indicated by the finding that pollen tube elongation under NAA treatment was detected in the ovule in both genotypes, whereas this phenomenon was not observed under AOPP treatment. This finding indicated that the penetration ability of the pollen tube in the pistil under heat stress could lead to the different heat tolerance between these two genotypes, which can be mediated by the auxin level.</p><p id="Par33">The auxin level in the pistil is reported to be significantly increased during fertilization, suggesting that it plays critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube elongation in the pistil (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>). The Arabidopsis mutant defective in auxin synthesis impaired the heat tolerance at the pollen mother cell meiosis stage, and exogenous auxin reversed the pollen sterility caused by heat stress (Sakata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). These findings are consistent with our results that the auxin level in pistils was significantly increased in NPB, whereas a sharp decrease was found in HTS under heat stress. However, Min et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>) reported that high temperature induced the expression of <italic>CASEIN KINASEI</italic> (<italic>GhCKI</italic>) in heat susceptible cotton, coupled with the suppression of starch synthase activity, decreases in glucose level during anther development and increase in auxin level in late-stage anthers. These findings suggested that high background auxin might be a disadvantage for late stage cotton anthers development during heat stress (Min et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2014</xref>). Unfortunately, higher auxin level was found in NPB than HTS under natural condition, and under heat stress a remarkable increase was found in the former while a larger decrease were recorded in the latter compared with their respective control under natural conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). These different results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the different responses of auxin to heat stress in plants are ambiguous and require further investigation.</p><p id="Par34">Undoubtedly, auxin has very important roles in pollen tube growth in plants, a process during which auxin reaches its highest level in the stigma and is mainly distributed in the transmitting tissue (Chen and Zhao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). After the pollen tubes enter the styles, the signal increases in the part where the pollen tubes would enter and then rapidly declines in the part where the pollen tubes have penetrated, suggesting that auxin acts as a molecular signal to guide the pollen tube growing into the sac (Chen and Zhao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). Thus, a significant decrease of the auxin level in HTS under heat stress could disrupt pollen tube growth within the pistil, resulting in cessation of pollen tubes growth. Since auxin can attract more energy to for the fertilization in the pistil (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>), this decrease in the auxin level also disrupt energy homeostasis, resulting in the cessation of pollen tube growth, as this is a high ATP-consuming process (Selinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>). It has been reported that not only the mitochondrial respiration and fermentation (Johns et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1993</xref>; Tadege and Kuhlemeier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1997</xref>; Taylor and Hepler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1997</xref>), but also plastidial glycolysis and the balancing of the ATP/NAD(P)H ratio contribute to satisfy the energy demand (C&#x000e1;rdenas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Tang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Fujiwara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2012</xref>; Hashida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">The auxin level in the pistil of rice was found to be regulated by NAA in this experiment. Specifically, that the auxin level in the NAA-treated pistil was significantly higher than those treated with H<sub>2</sub>O and AOPP in both genotypes under natural or heat-stress conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Accordingly, the relative expression of <italic>YUC</italic> genes were higher with NAA treatment than those with H<sub>2</sub>O and AOPP treatments under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). These findings were consistent with the results of Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref>), who reported that auxin treatment upregulated the expression levels of the several <italic>YUC</italic> genes in bamboo. Similar finding was also found in Arabidopsis (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>), which after being treated with NAA for 12&#x000a0;h, exhibited a relative expression of <italic>CTL1</italic> that was related to auxin distribution and which was enhanced in the meristem and elongation zones of roots with increasing NAA concentrations. However, Suzuki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>) reported that NAA decreased endogenous auxin levels and the expression levels of several <italic>YUC</italic> genes in Arabidopsis. We inferred that these different results might be related to the NAA concentrations and the ways of spraying NAA onto plants, rather than the plant species. Indeed, it has been reported that lower concentrations of NAA (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>) enhanced the auxin levels by increasing the relative expression of <italic>YUC</italic> genes <italic>and CTL1</italic> in bamboo and Arabidopsis, respectively (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">b</xref>), while higher concentrations (&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>) in liquid medium inhibited the auxin level by repressing the expression of <italic>YUC</italic> genes (Suzuki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>). Also, in this study, about 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup> NAA exogenously spayed onto spikelets could reduce the spikelet sterility caused by heat stress at anthesis of rice, which was consistent with the results of Sakata et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>) in Arabidopsis accompanied with the enhancement in auxin levels and the relative expression of <italic>YUC</italic> genes.</p><p id="Par36">ROS is needed to sustain the normal rate of pollen tube growth and this is likely to be a general mechanism in the control of the growth of the tip of polarized plant cells (Potock&#x000fd; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>), which suggests that ROS is involved in auxin-induced pollen tube growth in the pistil of rice under heat stress. The results of the present study revealed a remarkable increase in ROS induced by heat stress in NPB with H<sub>2</sub>O treatment, while no obvious difference was found in HTS compared with the control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Also, the ROS was significantly increased in both genotypes when sprayed with NAA, particularly in HTS. In contrast, inhibition of ROS production was observed in plants with AOPP treatments, which suggested that crosstalk between auxin and ROS occur in plants under abiotic stress (Joo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>; Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>). Auxin induces apoplastic superoxide ion production, which facilitates the loosening of the cell wall during cell elongation and growth in maize and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Schopfer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2001</xref>; Mangano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). In turn, the increased ROS level affects auxin gradients and/or sensitivity, including the oxidative degradation of auxin and auxin transport and distribution (Kawano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>). In fact, non-uniform distribution of ROS was shown in the pistil with the highest level found in the style, followed by the stigma and ovary in both genotypes irrespective of whether it was under natural condition or heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Thus, the changes in ROS level in the ovary might play a more important role in the elongation of the pollen tube into the ovule, as it could lead to the formation of an auxin gradient in the pistil during pollination. The results presented here showed that the ROS level was lower in the ovary compared with that in the style in both genotypes under heat stress compared with those under natural conditions. Accordingly, a larger decrease was found in HTS than in NPB with H<sub>2</sub>O treatment. However, the decrease in ROS level in NPB was smaller than that in HTS in the presence of NAA compared with those with H<sub>2</sub>O treatment under heat stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4n</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">p</xref>). However, similar results have not been documented in abiotic stress, suggesting that the role of a ROS gradient in the pistil in pollen tube elongation remains ambiguous.</p><p id="Par37">POD is important for plants to survive under abiotic stress by scavenging excess ROS to maintain redox homeostasis (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>). However, POD is also an auxin oxidase that reduces auxin in plants (Mathesius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2001</xref>). Accordingly, we inferred that POD might negatively mediate pollen tube elongation in pistils under heat stress, since the highest increase was found with the AOPP treatment in both genotypes under heat stress, followed by the treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O and NAA compared with their respective control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).

Additionally, under heat stress, significantly higher decrease in POD activity was found in NPB plants under H<sub>2</sub>O treatment compared with its respective control, while no significant difference was found in HTS plants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), which indicated that POD might be the main factor leading to the different heat tolerance between these two genotypes.</p><p id="Par38">According to the above discussion, under natural conditions the pollen tubes grow in the pistil, and then elongate into the ovule under natural conditions, whereas under heat stress they cease to grow in the stigma or style before reaching the ovule (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Auxin plays a key role in pollen tube elongation in the pistil by acting as a guiding signal and providing sufficient energy, as it is a high energy-demanding process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). ROS also acts as signaling molecules in pollen tube elongation in the pistil, and the crosstalk between ROS and auxin are also involved in this process, as indicated by the similarity of their patterns of change under heat stress. POD negatively regulates pollen tube elongation by degrading auxin and scavenging ROS. Under heat stress, the POD activity was significantly decreased in NPB, while no significant change in POD activity was found in HTS compared with control, suggesting that it might be the main factor leading to the decrease in auxin and ROS. During this process, exogenous NAA can reduce the POD activity by inhibiting the relative expression level of <italic>POX</italic>, while ROS can induce an increase of the POD activity.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Descriptive model of the function of auxin in the pollen tube growth in rice pistil.

Larger decrease in the level of auxin was found in HTS than NPB compared with their respective control, thus lower decrease in POD activity was found in the former than the latter. There was no significant difference in pollen tube growth in the pistil, specifically in the stigma, style and ovary, among all the treatments in both genotypes, under natural conditions. The pollen tube in the NPB pistils under H<sub>2</sub>O treatment was still found in the ovary under heat stress, while that in the HTS pistils it was invisible. Also, the pollen tube elongation was observed in the ovary and ovule in both genotypes when sprayed with NAA, but with the AOPP treatment it was not observed under heat stress. This finding suggested that NAA can enhance heat tolerance in plants by preventing the cessation of pollen tube elongation in the pistil caused by heat stress. In fact, similar patterns of change were found in the levels of auxin and ROS in the pistil of both genotypes, indicating that larger increase in auxin and ROS levels were obtained with NAA treatment, followed by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O and AOPP under heat stress compared with their respective control. However, the highest POD activity was observed with the AOPP treatment, followed by the treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O, and NAA in both genotypes under heat stress. These finding indicated that crosstalk between ROS and auxin might occur during pollen tube elongation in the pistil under heat stress, while POD might be the factor negatively affecting this process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
