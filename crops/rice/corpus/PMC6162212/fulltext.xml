In this study, UV-B-exposed rice straw was decomposed under different N addition treatments for 15 months to investigate the indirect effects of UV-B radiation on straw chemistry and direct effects of N deposition on decomposition. UV-B exposure during rice plant growth changed the rice straw chemical composition, increasing the concentrations of acid-insoluble fraction (AIF), acid-soluble fraction, and UV-B-absorbing compounds. High N content had a negative effect on decomposition of rice straw exposed to enhanced and ambient UV-B radiation. Both AIF concentration and FTIR peak intensities indicated that lignin in rice straw was selectively preserved following N addition and UV-B radiation, reducing straw decomposition rate, which corresponded to lower activities of lignin-degrading enzymes in the later stage of decomposition. Thus, enhanced UV-B radiation during rice plant growth produced more recalcitrant substrates (lignin) and N reacted with lignin to produce more resistant compounds, further decreasing straw decomposition rate. UV-B radiation during plant growth and N deposition inhibit litter decomposition in agroecosystem, and their effects should be considered when establishing biogeochemical models in response to global changes.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Litter decomposition is an important ecosystem process that affects carbon (C) and nutrients recycling. Despite several studies on litter decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, there are still certain uncertainties on how this essential process is affected by global change drivers such as ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation and nitrogen (N) deposition. As these uncertainties impede the conclusions drawn in biogeochemical models on litter decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, it is ecologically crucial for predicting and quantifying the consequences of enhanced UV-B radiation and anthropogenic N deposition in the ecosystem.</p><p id="Par3">While numerous studies have investigated the influence of increased solar UV-B radiation on plants, especially on plant growth, production, DNA damage, and morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, fewer studies have examined the UV-B effects on the decomposition of plant litter, an important ecosystem process. Litter decomposition may be directly and indirectly influenced by increased UV-B radiation. Several studies that evaluated the direct effects of UV-B radiation on litter decomposition have demonstrated that enhanced UV-B exposure accelerated photodegradation of lignin and/or changed the community and activity of decomposers, ultimately affecting the litter decomposition rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, only limited studies have assessed the indirect effects of UV-B radiation on litter decomposition. UV-B radiation can indirectly influence litter decomposition by changing the litter chemistry in the tissues of growing plants, including increase in N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, cellulose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, UV-B-absorbing compounds (AU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and lignin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> contents, and decrease in soluble carbohydrates and lignin/N ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, some reports did not find any evidence of the influence of supplemental UV-B exposure during plant growth on litter chemistry and decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These inconsistent findings may be owing to the differences in the environmental conditions, UV-B dose, and plant species employed.</p><p id="Par4">As a key global change driver, N deposition plays a vital role in litter decomposition process by altering the organic matter composition and enzymes activities of microbial decomposers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; however, it is still unclear whether this is a broad effect or a chemical-fractions-specific effect on straw. Increasing studies have demonstrated a decline in the total microbial biomass and microbial respiration across a range of terrestrial ecosystems under N deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which may be owing to several mechanisms that could suppress microbial growth, such as decrease in pH leading to soil acidification, loss of cation nutrients resulting in aluminum toxicity, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Interestingly, N addition inhibits the activity of oxidative enzymes associated with lignin degradation, such as phenol oxidase and peroxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting its ability to preserve specific chemical fractions in decomposing litter. Some studies have indicated that N deposition has significant effects on cellulolytic enzyme activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, N addition has been reported to selectively preserve lignin relative to polysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although the microbial responses to N addition are clear, there is still a lack of evidence for lower decomposition of specific chemical fractions in decomposing litter following N deposition.</p><p id="Par6">The effect of N deposition on straw decomposition is debatable. Some reports have shown that N deposition can increase soil N availability and change the C/N ratios of straw, resulting in higher straw decomposition rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, some studies have indicated that high N deposition inhibited straw decomposition owing to the accumulation of polymers produced by the reaction between N and lignin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A meta-analysis showed that externally added N negatively affected litter decomposition in general, and that the effects considerably varied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These negative effects have been reported to often occur when the N deposition dose was high and the litter quality was low (high lignin concentration and lignin/N ratio)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Besides, litter quality has also been demonstrated to change with UV-B exposure during plant growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and numerous studies have suggested that UV-B exposure increased the content of phenolic compounds such as lignin and tannins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, it is still unclear whether the change in litter quality induced by UV-B exposure during plant growth could influence litter decomposition under the condition of N deposition.</p><p id="Par7">In subtropical China, the amount of N deposition from the atmosphere exceeds 30&#x02009;kg&#x02009;N ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which is predicted to increase in future. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of empirical evidence for the chemical changes in UV-B-exposed litter in response to N deposition. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the indirect effects of solar UV-B radiation during rice plant growth on rice straw decomposition, determine whether UV-B radiation could influence the chemical composition of rice straw, and ascertain whether the effects of UV-B exposure vary with different levels of added N. The rice plants were grown under enhanced UV-B radiation and the resulting litter was decomposed under three stimulated N addition treatments (0, 30, and 60&#x02009;kg&#x02009;N ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for 15 months. The indirect effects of UV-B exposure were evaluated by determining the changes in C, N, and chemical characteristics of straw and their influence on subsequent decomposition under N deposition condition. In addition, the variations in the chemical components and lignin-degrading enzymes during straw decomposition were investigated based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra. The study hypothesized that (1) enhanced UV-B radiation during rice plant growth could alter rice straw chemistry and inhibit straw decomposition and (2) the effect of N deposition on rice straw decomposition could be modified by exposure to UV-B radiation during rice plant growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effects of UV-B on initial straw chemistry</title><p id="Par8">UV-B exposure during rice plant growth significantly affected the initial straw chemical characteristics.

Exposure to UV-B radiation during rice plant growth increased the contents of AIF, ASF, C/N, AIF/N, and AU in the initial straw (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which might have resulted in an increase in the recalcitrant fractions that are difficult to break down by soil microorganisms, leading to a decline in rice straw decomposition rate. These changes in litter quality are consistent with those reported in a previous study that showed that UV-B radiation during plant growth resulted in increased production of AU, such as lignin and tannin, which suppress the growth of some fungal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. During decomposition, the breakdown of soluble carbohydrates is easier than that of lignin and cellulose by microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, in the present study, the concentrations of lignin were higher, whereas the contents of NSCs were lower in the UVB, when compared with those in the Ambient, during decomposition. These results confirmed that the differences in the initial straw chemistry between UVB and Ambient persisted throughout the process of straw decomposition. Furthermore, variations in the concentrations of resistant substrates such as lignin were observed between the UVB and Ambient during straw decomposition (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The peak near 1510&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is often employed as the characteristic lignin peak.

For instance, Pancotto <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> compared the decomposition of <italic>Gunnera</italic> litter (relatively high lignin content) and barley litter (relatively low lignin content) under UV-B condition, and illustrated that the microbial decomposition was lower when lignin content was high.</p><p id="Par19">Furthermore, in the present study, exposure to UV-B radiation during rice plant growth also influenced N accumulation and release in rice straw (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and the residual N content in UVB was lower than that in Ambient. In contrast, Pancotto <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> reported that barley litter exposed to UV-B radiation released less N, when compared with that subjected to reduced UV-B treatment. These discrepancies in the results could be attributed to the differences in the initial litter quality or UV-B radiation intensity during plant growth.</p><p id="Par20">In addition to the indirect effects of UV-B exposure during plant growth, N deposition is also known to influence litter decomposition. A meta-analysis of decomposition demonstrated that externally supplied N often presented negative relationships with decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In the present study, low N addition did not affect rice straw decomposition, whereas high N deposition inhibited the decomposition process (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This result is consistent with the finding reported by Knorr <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, who demonstrated that the negative effect of N on decomposition increased with increasing N addition rate of up to 20-fold of ambient N deposition.

Furthermore, N limits microbial growth and suppresses the activities of enzymes associated with lignin degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, it can be concluded that inhibition of lignin degradation by N addition contributes to the negative effects of high N deposition on litter decomposition.</p><p id="Par21">The different responses of straw decomposition to N addition could be partly related to straw quality. Knorr <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> demonstrated that N addition decreased the mass loss in low-quality litters with high lignin concentrations, similar to that observed in the present study. AIF is a suitable indicator for lignin in litters, revealing that N addition selectively protected lignin, when compared with the rest of the straw mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Therefore, the slow straw decomposition observed in the present study might have probably resulted from the suppression of AIF decomposition following N deposition, especially in UV-B-exposed straw with high lignin concentration.</p><p id="Par22">The response of ligninolytic enzymes activities in decomposing straw appears to provide some explanations for the inhibitory effect of N addition on straw decomposition rate in all the N addition treatments. The suppression of lignin degradation by N addition has also been reported in other studies that implied that large amount of exogenous N inhibited microbial metabolism of lignin and suppressed lignin-degrading enzymes activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Phenol oxidase is an important lignin-degrading enzyme produced by white rot fungi and certain microorganisms belonging to Basidiomycota, Xylariaceae, and Ascomycota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, which was strongly inhibited by N addition in the UVB and Ambient in the later stage of straw decomposition in the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These findings are in line with some previous reports, but are contradictory to certain studies. For instance, Freedman <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> found that the activities of phenol oxidase and peroxidase associated with lignin degradation decreased under simulated N deposition conditions. Hobbie <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> demonstrated a strong relationship between the negative effects of N on decomposition and the dynamics of ligninolytic enzymes activities in <italic>Quercus ellipsoidalis</italic> litter. On the contrary, some studies did not find any obvious effects of N addition on lignin-degrading enzymes activities in soil or litter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, the mechanisms related to the negative effects of N on the later stages of litter decomposition may vary with different sites and litter types owing to the variation in enzymes activities. Furthermore, the added N may react with C compounds such as polyphenols in litter to form other recalcitrant complexes, thus making the enzymes less effective under N-enriched condition.</p><p id="Par23">The findings of the present study showed that exposure to UV-B during rice plant growth led to increased lignin and AU fraction, and a decline in soluble carbohydrates content. During decomposition of rice straw, excess N sourced from N addition may interact with lignin (partly formed from UV-B exposure during rice plant growth) to form recalcitrant compounds that are difficult to breakdown by microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, N addition could suppress the activity of lignin-degrading enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, making it more difficult to decompose the accumulated lignin in UVB samples with added N. As a result, the residual mass of UV-B-exposed rice straw following 15 months of decomposition with N deposition was higher, supporting our second hypothesis. Thus, UV-B exposure during plant growth and N deposition during decomposition might be expected to function in the same direction, with more evident inhibitory effect on straw decomposition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">UV-B exposure during rice plant growth changed the initial rice straw chemistry, increasing the concentrations of AIF, ASF, C/N, lignin/N, and AU, which may limit the activities of microbial decomposers, indirectly resulting in a decrease in the straw decomposition rate. The negative effects of high N deposition on straw decomposition in UVB and Ambient were observed in the later stage of decomposition partly owing to the decrease in lignin-degrading enzymes. The changes in the rice straw characteristics induced by UV-B radiation during rice plant growth aggravated the negative effects on straw decomposition under N deposition condition. Thus, UV-B radiation during plant growth and N deposition during litter decomposition may have incremental inhibitory effects on the dynamics of C pools in agroecosystem, and such effects should be more widely considered in biogeochemical models in future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par25">The study was conducted in Jiujiang city (29&#x000b0;68&#x02032;N, 115&#x000b0;98&#x02032;E), Jiangxi Province, China.

The UV-B energy was measured using a UV-297 radiometer (Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Rice straw decomposition experiment</title><p id="Par27">In September 2015, the post-harvest rice straw was gathered from the experiment pots. The straw samples were air-dried for 1 month and oven-dried at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h in a dryer. The oven-dried straw samples were cut into 1&#x02009;cm by using a straw chopper.

The litterbags were 20-cm long and 15-cm wide with a 1-mm mesh-size. Each litterbag filled with 15&#x02009;g of oven-dried straw was placed on the surface of the soil in pots. The harvested rice straw was subjected to three N addition treatments, 0&#x02009;kg&#x02009;N ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (control; N0), 30&#x02009;kg&#x02009;N ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (low N; N1), and 60&#x02009;kg&#x02009;N ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (high N; N2), with three replicates. Based on the previous methods simulating N deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, ammonium nitrate (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) dissolved in water was uniformly sprayed using a sprayer into the N1 and N2 pots at the end of each month. In the control (N0 pots), equivalent water without NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> was sprayed every month. The litterbags with rice straw under different N addition treatments were collected from each pot after 3, 9 and 15 months of decomposition, respectively.

Phenol-sulfuric acid analysis was used to determine the sugars content representing NSCs. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent based on catechin standards was employed to test the content of soluble phenolics. Coomassie protein Bradford Reagent was used to determine the contents of proteins, and lipids were extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol solution.</p><p id="Par31">After being oven-dried at 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h, the rice straw samples were mixed with KBr, compressed, and analyzed with a Perkin Elmer 16&#x02009;F PC Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) apparatus at 4000&#x02013;400&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The region between 2000 and 600&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was examined because of the drastic change in the intensity of the peaks. The infrared spectra for the initial and decomposed straw samples (after 15 months of decomposition) were collected, and 64 scans at a resolution of 4&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> were recorded for each sample.
