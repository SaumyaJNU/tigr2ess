    "The white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera (Horv√°th) has become an important pest on rice in China and Southeast Asian countries. White-backed planthopper wing bud length is in relation to adult wing length, but little is known about the development and differentiation of wing buds at the molecular level. Using Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology, we sequenced four cDNA libraries, two biological replicates of long-winged female fifth-instar nymphs (LW), and two of short-winged nymphs (SW). In total, 62,154 unigenes with an average length of 984 bp and N50 length of 1,878 bp were obtained by de novo transcriptome assembly. A total of 18,416 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted based on the unigenes. Ninety-three percentage of these ORFs could be annotated by searching for homology in six protein databases. A total of 184 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 129 upregulated and 55 downregulated were found in SW compared to LW. Gene Ontology and euKaryotic Orthologous Group classification provided comprehensive information about the function of each gene. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed five enriched pathways including three metabolic pathways. In addition, we found that some DEGs were relevant to muscle movement and cuticle and likely involved in development and differentiation of wing buds. This study provided transcriptome resource of female fifth-instar nymphs of white-backed planthopper including long-winged and short-winged nymphs, and different molecular features between them lay the foundation for adult wing morph prediction, promoting further studies on planthopper population management."
