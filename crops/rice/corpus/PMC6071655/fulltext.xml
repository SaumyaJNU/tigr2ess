<italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> (white-backed planthopper) has become an important pest on rice in China and Southeast Asian countries (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2000</xref>) due to its potential destruction by sucking rice phloem sap and transmitting plant viruses such as ragged stunt virus, grassy stunt virus, and Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. 2015a</xref>). Similar to another insect in the order Hemiptera, namely <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (brown planthopper), the adult white-backed planthopper usually show dimorphism in relation to wing development, occurring in both females and males, though male adults are almost always long-winged (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Kisimoto 1956</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1965</xref>). The long-winged adults are good at migrating and tracking the growth condition of host plants to avoid the harsh environment. However, short-winged morphs lack of fully developed wings but have a strong ability for reproduction (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al. 2016</xref>). Numerous studies revealed that genetic background (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mahmud 1980</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">Iwanaga et al. 1985</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Mori and Nakasuji 1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Tojo 1991</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al. 2012</xref>) and environmental factors such as temperature (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 1983</xref>) often play important roles in planthopper wing dimorphism, but the exact mechanism about wing morph determination has not been illuminated. More recently, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2015b)</xref> identified two insulin receptors (insulin receptor 1 [InR1] and 2 [InR2]) to be of great significant to the regulation of wing morph switching in planthoppers. They proposed a model for the molecular regulation of wing polyphenism in planthoppers. The long-winged morph is the basic wing pattern of the winged insects. There are two InRs in the wing buds of rice planthoppers. When the insulin/insulin-like growth factor&#x02013;like peptide Ilp3 which is secreted by the brain binds to InR1, the insulin signaling pathway is activated leading to long-winged adults. However, when InR2 combined with InR1 to form a heterodimeric receptor, the <italic>Nl</italic>InR1&#x02013;<italic>Nl</italic>PI(3)K&#x02013;<italic>Nl</italic>Akt signaling pathway is blocked, thus producing short-winged adults. This model provided a molecular basis for the regulation of wing dimorphism in rice planthoppers, including white-backed planthopper.</p><p>In recent years, high-throughput RNA sequencing has greatly facilitated transcriptomics research on insects, especially for insects without reference genome sequences. From 2008 to 2013, insect transcriptomes of 68 species belonging to seven orders have been sequenced by using next-generation sequencing (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Yuan 2013</xref>). Early in this year, the first assembled and annotated whole genome sequence and transcriptome of white-backed planthopper have been reported in public (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>White-backed planthopper wing bud length is in relation to adult wing length (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Perfect 1982</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Yamada 1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al. 1994</xref>), for example, the fifth-instar nymph with wing bud longer than 1.10 mm emerged as long-winged adult, with wing bud shorter than 0.95 mm emerge as short-winged adult (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al. 1994</xref>), but little is known about the development and differentiation of wing buds at the molecular level. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing on long-winged and short-winged female fifth-instar nymphs of white-backed planthopper by Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology. Then raw data were assembled and annotated successively to obtain complete transcriptome information. To identify genes that may be involved in the regulation of white-backed planthopper wing bud differentiation, we performed differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis between long-winged and short-winged nymphs. These results will be helpful to understand the molecular underpinnings of wing bud differentiation.</p><p>As far as we know, it is the first time that the transcriptome of female fifth-instar nymphs of white-backed planthopper including long-winged and short-winged nymphs has been reported. The results in this study will be good resources to learn more about white-backed planthopper physiology and deepen understanding of wing bud development and differentiation in planthoppers.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>White-backed planthopper Sample Collection and Processing</title><p>The white-backed planthopper strain was collected from the rice field located in the South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.

RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA). The integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA). Equal volumes of RNA from each of the two replications of LW and SW were pooled. The mRNA was enriched with magnetic beads with Oligo dT, then fragmented into short fragments. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by random hexamer primers with the mRNA fragments as templates. With the addition of buffer, dNTPs, RNaseH, and DNA polymerase I, the second-strand cDNA was synthesized and purified with QiaQuick PCR kit and washed off with EB buffer. The purified double-stranded cDNA was subjected to end repair, adding A tail and adaptors, then the products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. To obtain the cDNA library, PCR amplification was conducted with the cDNA fragments as templates.

To adapt variation in environment, white-backed planthoppers evolve into two wing morphs, and it is well recognized that long-winged adults can fly over a long distance, whereas short-winged adults have robust fecundity. Hence, white-backed planthopper can easily keep away from hash environment and propagate with extreme rapidity to maintain the prosperity of the population. Based on these characteristics, the increasing short-winged adults indicate the expanding of white-backed planthopper population, while the emergence or the increasing of long-winged adults indicates the emigration or immigration phenomenon. Therefore, accurately understanding the wing morph dynamics of white-backed planthopper is beneficial to predict the quantity changes of white-backed planthopper in time and avoid the outbreak of pests. <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Perfect (1982)</xref> have demonstrated stable relations between the wing bud length of fifth-instar nymph and wing morph of brown planthopper reared on different rice conditions (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al. 1994</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Yamada (1990)</xref> pointed out that 0.94 mm is the critical value of wing bud length at which fifth-instar nymphs of brown planthopper developed into long-winged female adults. Here, we used RNA-seq to identity genes related to wing bud development and differentiation in white-backed planthopper and then found out the characteristics of these genes by bioinformatics analysis.</p><p>In this study, a de novo transcriptome was assembled with sequences from long-winged and short-winged female fifth-instar nymphs. All clean reads were assembled into 98,097 transcripts and 62,154 unigenes of white-backed planthopper. Based on the unigenes, 18,416 ORFs were predicted, of which 17,145 were annotated in Nr database. A comparison with homologous sequences showed that brown planthopper shared the highest similarity with white-backed planthopper in the BLASTx annotation, whereas white-backed planthopper itself had a best match percentage of less than 1%. The reason for this is that brown planthopper has served as a model organism in planthopper research and more sequence resources are available than those of white-backed planthopper in Nr database. According to the KOG classification and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, it was noted that some DEG sets were involved in transport and metabolism of amino acid and lipid, which meant energy was an important factor for wing bud differentiation. Specially, PPARs are thought to serve as a transcriptional activator of fatty acid catabolism (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Contreras et al. 2013</xref>). A previous study (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al. 2010</xref>) in the transcriptome of brown planthopper has also revealed that PPAR pathway could provide energy for flying by regulating lipid metabolism in macropterous female adults, which played a key role in migration. Later, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Contreras et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al. (2016)</xref> found that PPARs also had important effects on glucose and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, PPAR&#x003b4; can induce genes for long-chain fatty acid oxidation during fasting and endurance exercise in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al. 2016</xref>), which might be important for regulating muscle activity of long-winged planthoppers in their flight.</p><p>Based on the gene expression profiles and Nr annotation, five genes related to muscle movement showed higher expression levels in SW than in LW (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among them, three genes showed the most significant upregulated levels in SW. At the same time, they exclusively expressed in short-winged nymphs, suggesting that these three genes were vital genes in wing bud differentiation.</p><table-wrap id="T4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>DEGs related to muscle movement based on the Nr annotation analysis</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene ID</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up/downregulation</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FPKM in SW</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FPKM in LW</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FDR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">c53337_c4_g1_i4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.40</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.18E-06</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin-VIIA isoform X1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">c51535_c1_g1_i1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.70</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.17E-03</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Troponin C, isotype gamma-like</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">c55508_c0_g2_i1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">207.97</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.31</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.99E-02</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myosin-2 essential light chain isoform X1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">c54722_c0_g1_i3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.73</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.83E-05</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pro-resilin-like isoform X2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">c44469_c0_g1_i4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Up</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.11E-02</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pro-resilin-like</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition, 25 genes with 24 upregulated and only 1 downregulated, encoding cuticle or cuticular proteins, were enriched in SW. All of these genes exhibited dramatically differential expression between SW and LW and three of which expressed uniquely in SW. GO and KOG classification analysis revealed that none of them obtained KOG classification while 18 genes got the same GO term&#x02014;structural constituent of cuticle in the molecular function category. Cuticle or cuticular proteins had been found in a wide variety of insects, such as <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2016</xref>), <italic>Athetis lepigone</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. 2013</xref>), and <italic>Dendrolimus punctatus</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. 2016</xref>) in the order Lepidoptera. These researches all pointed out that many cuticle or cuticular proteins were identified as DEGs in the pairwise comparisons of each developmental stage, highlighting their importance for the development and metamorphosis in insect life history. Both wing buds and cuticle develop from ectoderm. During molting stage, the growth of wing buds coordinated with the metabolism of cuticle (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. 1998</xref>). So we hypothesized that cuticle composition differed between SW and LW. The main component of insect cuticle is cuticular proteins and chitin, they together support and maintain the physical structure of the organism and serve as natural barriers against harmful substance from outside world (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Moussian 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Noh et al. 2016</xref>). Previous study showed that poisoned by flufenoxuron, the synthesis of chitin was greatly inhibited (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 1996</xref>), causing molting disordered and wing buds could not develop into complete and normal wings. In conclusion, there must be close relationships between cuticle and wing buds. Moreover, there were still many crucial genes participating in development of wing buds, including genes associated with sensory process, DNA methylation, and circadian clock.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We assembled the transcriptome of <italic>S. furcifera</italic> and performed DEG analysis between long-winged and short-winged female fifth-instar nymphs. Six database annotation results helped us comprehensively understand the function of each gene. We finally identified a large number of candidate genes potentially participating in development and differentiation of wing buds, including genes related to muscle movement and cuticle. These findings will provide critical clues for exploring molecular mechanisms of development and differentiation of wing buds. Nymphs at fifth-instar stage are preparing for eclosion to adults. As stated above, the wing bud length of fifth-instar nymphs has complex relationships with the subsequent wing morph of the adults being produced so more research is needed to be done in this area. We hope from some molecular features of wing buds that adult wing morph can be predicted accurately and easily, providing a valuable tool in the study of delphacid population dynamics, thus facilitating the development of pest control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31171844) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2015A030313114).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References Cited</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
