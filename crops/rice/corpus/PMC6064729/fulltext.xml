Although many reports have described the functions of ubiquitination in plant defense responses, few have focused on global changes in the ubiquitome. To better understand the regulatory roles of ubiquitination in rice pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), we investigated the ubiquitome of rice seedlings after treatment with two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the fungal-derived chitin or the bacterial-derived flg22, using label-free quantitative proteomics. In chitin-treated samples, 144 and 167 lysine-ubiquitination sites in 121 and 162 proteins showed increased and decreased ubiquitination, respectively. In flg22-treated samples, 151 and 179 lysine-ubiquitination sites in 118 and 166 proteins showed increased and decreased ubiquitination, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses indicated diverse regulatory roles of these proteins. The ubiquitination levels of many proteins involved in the ubiquitination system, protein transportation, ligand recognition, membrane trafficking, and redox reactions were significantly changed in response to the elicitor treatments. Notably, the ubiquitination levels of many enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway were up-regulated, indicating that this pathway is tightly regulated by ubiquitination during rice PTI. Additionally, the ubiquitination levels of some key components in plant hormone signaling pathways were up- or down-regulated, suggesting that ubiquitination may fine-tune hormone pathways for defense responses. Our results demonstrated that ubiquitination, by targeting a wide range of proteins for degradation or stabilization, has a widespread role in modulating PTI in rice. The large pool of ubiquitination targets will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how the ubiquitination system regulates defense responses to pathogen attack.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>elicitors</kwd><kwd>hormone signaling</kwd><kwd>phenylpropanoid pathway</kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>quantitative proteomics</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Natural Science Foundation of China<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">31422045</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have developed sophisticated mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogen infection. As an example, plants recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through plasma membrane-located pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), and transduce the perceived signal to downstream components, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades in the cytoplasm. This process culminates in the activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). To overcome PTI, pathogens can secrete effector proteins into host plant cells to suppress or avoid PTI. However, as a countermeasure, plants have evolved cytoplasmic immune receptors that recognize the pathogen-derived effectors and activate a robust second layer of plant immunity, called effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The interactions of receptors of PAMPs, such as the chitin receptor CERK1 or the flg22 receptor FLS2, have been extensively studied in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f3;mez-G&#x000f3;mez and Boller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Miya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Macho and Zipfel, 2014</xref>). Although early molecular events associated with different receptor &#x02013; PAMP interactions are distinct, the subsequent gene expression patterns extensively overlap, and PTI- and ETI-mediated changes in gene expression are also broadly similar (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). Both PTI and ETI involve various signaling pathways and cellular responses mediated by plant hormones, such as the salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Broekaert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Loake and Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Balbi and Devoto, 2008</xref>). The downstream cellular responses of PTI and ETI include production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Frederickson Matika and Loake, 2014</xref>), activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sels et al., 2008</xref>), and accumulation of secondary metabolites (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Piasecka et al., 2015</xref>). ROS are rapidly produced for cell signaling and defense, and especially during the hypersensitive response (HR). Because excessive ROS is harmful for plant cells, various ROS-detoxifying enzymes also accumulate during defense responses to maintain the redox balance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Frederickson Matika and Loake, 2014</xref>). PR genes, such as those encoding chitinases, are induced to suppress pathogen invasion (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sels et al., 2008</xref>), while secondary metabolites, such as the phenolic compounds flavonoids and lignin precursors, are also important components of defense responses and in some cases can scavenge ROS (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Piasecka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitination is a key mechanism for the regulation of plant immunity (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Marino et al., 2012</xref>) and of many other physiological processes in plants, such as the activation of receptors and their trafficking (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Furlan et al., 2012</xref>), phytohormone signaling (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Kelley and Estelle, 2012</xref>), and responses to abiotic or biotic stresses (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, many proteins involved in plant immune responses, such as plasma membrane receptors, have been identified as ubiquitination targets (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of the significance of ubiquitination in plant immunity have focused on E3 ligase proteins (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Duplan and Rivas, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Zeng, 2017</xref>). For example, the SCF complex-interacting protein, SGT1, which was the first identified component of E3 ligase, was shown to play a role in defense responses (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Azevedo et al., 2002</xref>). Other E3 ligases, including OsCOI1b, GID2, and OsCUL3a, also contribute to defense responses. OsCOI1b can interact with JAZ proteins and target them for degradation in response to JA signaling (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). GID2, which is an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, specifically interacts with phosphorylated SLR1 protein and regulates the gibberellin-dependent degradation of SLR1 in rice (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gomi et al., 2004</xref>). As a component of the Cullin3-based RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the number of known substrate proteins targeted by ubiquitination is very limited, and little is known about how ubiquitination fine-tunes plant defense responses.</p><p>Different methods have been used for the proteomic analysis of ubiquitination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Maor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Manzano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Saracco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kim D.Y. et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Svozil et al., 2014</xref>). For example, approximately 950 ubiquitination substrates were identified in seedlings treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kim D.Y. et al., 2013</xref>), and 1791 ubiquitinated substrates were identified in leaves and roots treated with the more specific proteasome inhibitor, Syringolin A (SylA) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Svozil et al., 2014</xref>). These ubiquitination substrates are associated with various cellular processes, such as transport, signal transduction, transcription, translation, and metabolism. Our previous study identified 464 ubiquitinated proteins in young rice leaves through affinity purification and high resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) analysis (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). Quantitative proteomic analysis also revealed changes in ubiquitination levels at different plant development stages or in response to different stresses. Under high salt stress, for example, a number of differentially expressed ubiquitinated proteins were identified in rice roots (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), while in petunia, a model plant for flower senescence studies, nearly 500 proteins were found to have significantly changed ubiquitination levels upon ethylene treatment (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated potential changes in ubiquitination status upon activation of rice defense responses and generated an in-depth quantitative proteomic catalog of ubiquitination in rice seedlings after chitin and flg22 treatments. Through a combination of highly sensitive immune affinity purification, LC&#x02013;MS/MS, and protein functional classification analysis, we identified 1,376 ubiquitinated proteins, of which 100s were found to show significant changes in their level of ubiquitination. Further analyses demonstrated that the ubiquitination system can coordinate different hormone signaling pathways and diverse cellular processes, including the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, as part of a defense response. Our data provides new insights into the function of the ubiquitination system in rice PTI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Rice (Japonica cultivar Nipponbare) was used in this study.

Proteins extracted from the treated samples were subjected to Western blot analysis, using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. We observed that proteins with a wide range of molecular masses were ubiquitinated, and a strong immunoblot signal was observed at 3 h after both treatments; no changes were evident in the water-treated seedlings (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S1</xref>). It is worth to note that although the same amount of total protein had been used in the blots, a slightly stronger immunoblot signal were observed in chitin- or flg22-treated than water-treated sample at 0 h time point (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>), the differences might be due to the variations in western blottings. To determine whether chitin or flg22 can induce defense responses in 1-week-old rice seedlings at 3 h, we detected the expression of the known PTI-activated genes in rice seedlings treated by chitin or flg22 using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression of the defense-related genes after chitin or flg22 treatment for 3 h (relative to <italic>OsUBQ1</italic>) were compared to their expressions after water treatment for 3 h (relative to <italic>OsUBQ1</italic>). Four defense-related genes, <italic>KS4, NAC4, PAL1</italic>, and <italic>PAL2</italic>, which are commonly used to detect chitin- or flg22-induced defense responses (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Shirsekar et al., 2014</xref>), were all significantly induced by chitin or flg22 treatment (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S2</xref>). This result confirmed that treatment of 1-week-old rice seedlings by chitin or flg22 for 3 h can induce strong defense responses. Therefore, we chose this time point for profiling of the ubiquitome.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Workflow for quantitative profiling of the ubiquitome. <bold>(A)</bold> Western blot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody.

Of the 464 ubiquitinated proteins previously found in young leaves of rice (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), 287 (61.9%) were also found in the current study (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S3B</xref>), indicating that the results of this study are reliable. Moreover, more than 70% of the ubiquitinated proteins identified in our study had not been reported previously, i.e., the current results substantially increased the number of known ubiquitinated proteins in rice. The identified lysine ubiquitinated peptides ranged in length from 7 to 66 amino acids. Of the 1,376 ubiquitinated proteins, 9.5% contained 11 amino acids, and 59.3% contained from 8 to 14 amino acids (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S3C</xref>). Among the ubiquitinated proteins, 55% had only one ubiquitinated lysine site, and 19.0, 9.2, 4.9, or 3.3% had two, three, four, or five ubiquitinated sites, respectively (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S3D</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>). In addition, 38 proteins (2.8%) were ubiquitinated at 10 or more lysine sites (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S3D</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>). Eight proteins had more than 15 ubiquitinated sites, including the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) PAL1 (26 sites) and PAL5 (17 sites) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">S3D</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>).

The ubiquitination level of two ET signaling pathway proteins, OsUsp1 and OsERF64, also changed following chitin and flg22 treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). The ET-responding transcription factor OsERF64 was not detected in chitin and flg22 treated samples, while the ET-responding stress adaptive protein OsUSP1 had increased ubiquitination level upon both treatment. The ABA-responsive protein EFA27 was increased in ubiquitination level by responding to flg22 but not detected in chitin-treated samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). GID2 is involved in the GA signaling pathway, and its ubiquitination levels decreased approximately twofold in response to chitin or flg22 treatment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). This could lead to elevated GID2 protein levels and promote its function as an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, regulating the GA-dependent degradation of SLR1 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gomi et al., 2004</xref>). Although SA is important in rice basal defense, we did not identify any SA-related components with changes in ubiquitination levels. Taken together, the quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that multiple hormone signaling pathways were influenced by the ubiquitination system in response to treatment with the PAMPs chitin or flg22 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymes in the Phenylpropanoid Pathway Are Targeted by the Ubiquitination System After PAMP Treatments</title><p>Lignin and other compounds synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway are important in responses to environmental stresses and pathogen infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fraser and Chapple, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we found that many enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, including OsPAL1, OsPAL2, OsPAL7, OsPAL5, Os4CL3, OsC4HL, OsCHS1, OsCOMT1, and OsF5H, had significantly increased ubiquitination levels in response to the chitin or flg22 treatment. Among them, OsPAL1, OsPAL5, Os4CL3, and OsCOMT1 contained multiple ubiquitination sites and their ubiquitination levels were significantly induced by both treatments (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref></bold>). These data are consistent with the finding that the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway in rice was repressed 3 h after chitin or flg22 treatment.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8</label><caption><p>Ubiquitinated proteins during defense responses include enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway and its key enzymes. <bold>(B)</bold> Ubiquitination sites in proteins encoding enzymes in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-09-01064-g008"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although many reports have described specific examples of ubiquitination in plant defense responses, our understanding on global changes in the plant ubiquitome is still lacking. In this study, we combined the high-resolution LC&#x02013;MS/MS with an affinity enrichment method to enhance ubiquitinated peptides, allowing the large scale and site-specific quantification of ubiquitination in rice seedlings in response to two PAMPs. We identified many new proteins targeted by elicitor-induced ubiquitination, highlighting the complexity of the regulatory system in plant defense responses.</p><sec><title>Common and Different Effects of Ubiquitination Elicited by Chitin and flg22</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that the gene expression patterns elicited by different PAMPs are largely similar during the late stages of defense responses, and that different PAMPs can induce similar plant signaling pathways and cellular responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). In this study, we compared the ubiquitome data obtained from samples treated with chitin or flg22 for 3 h, which is a late-defense response time point, and also found that the changes in ubiquitination levels elicited by these two PAMPs were broadly similar. These results suggest that the downstream signaling pathways and cellular processes involved in defense responses are also similar at the post-translational modification level. However, further studies are needed to determine the ubiquitome changes elicited by different PAMPs during the early stages of the defense response.</p><p>We did observe some differences between chitin- and flg22-regulated ubiquitination, including ubiquitination-associated with E3 ligases (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref></bold>), ROS production or detoxification (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref></bold>), and hormone pathways (such as ABA signaling) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). These data suggested that differences in these processes still exist between chitin- and flg22-regulated ubiquitination during the late stages of plant defense responses. These differences might have several explanations. For example, some of these ubiquitinated proteins could be specific to different elicitors or the responding times to different elicitors could be different. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ROS accumulation triggered by flg22 is controlled by RbohD (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">N&#x000fc;hse et al., 2007</xref>), while in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> triggered by fungal cell wall extracts requires NbRbohA and NbRbohB (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Yoshioka et al., 2003</xref>). In rice, OsRbohA is involved in rapid ROS production, while OsRbohE is involved in late ROS production during the immune response to <italic>Acidovorax avenae</italic> (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yoshiaki et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we found that the ubiquitination level of OsRbohA is up-regulated, which may lead to its degradation. It was reported that phosphorylation patterns in RbohD also differed following treatment with flg22 and xylanase in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, although both elicitors induce RbohD phosphorylation at similar locations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Benschop et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the RBOH proteins belongs to the seven transmembrane proteins, which could either be poly-ubiquitinated for lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, or mono-ubiquitinated for endocytosis internalization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shenoy, 2007</xref>). Which ubiquitination type(s) of the RBOH proteins could be undergo and what the subsequent functions could be, both are intriguing questions. The ubiquitination-mediated regulation of E3 ligases that specifically respond to different elicitors or pathogens has also been reported, especially targeting the receptors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Furlan et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the rice E3 ligase XB3 can respond to <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> and interact with the LRR-RLK XA21 to affect its accumulation (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> E3 ligase PUB1 can respond to <italic>Sinorhizobium meliloti</italic> and negatively regulate nodulation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mbengue et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ubiquitination Up- and Down-Regulates Plant Defense-Related Protein Levels</title><p>After chitin or flg22 treatment, a similar proportion of ubiquitination sites were up-regulated or down-regulated. Proteins with increased ubiquitination levels may themselves be degraded by the ubiquitination system, and in this case acts to reduce protein abundance. Proteins with reduced ubiquitination levels may avoid degradation, and in this case acts to increase protein abundance. The ubiquitination system can therefore rapidly enhance or suppress different cellular processes to facilitate defense responses. For example, upon elicitor induction, the defense-related receptors were mostly decreased in ubiquitination levels, while the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway could be suppressed by ubiquitination. Similarly, the hormone signaling pathways were activated while the BR and cytokinin pathways were repressed. Surprisingly, the auxin and GA signaling pathways were both repressed, likely through decreases in the ubiquitination levels of OsCYP2 and OsGID2, which are key proteins in the respective signaling pathways (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec><title>Key Processes in Plant Defense Responses Are Modified by Ubiquitination</title><p>The activity and stability of plant plasma membrane receptors, as well as protein kinases, are tightly regulated to ensure appropriate defense responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antolin-Llovera et al., 2012</xref>). There is growing evidence that the ubiquitination system can modulate the abundance of plasma membrane receptors by ubiquitination of the receptors themselves or of membrane trafficking components or receptor recycling components (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Furlan et al., 2012</xref>). However, the detailed mechanisms of this ubiquitination-mediated regulation remain unknown. We observed that the ubiquitination levels of four receptors, OsRLCK103, OsRLCK107, OsSERK2, and a BAK1 like protein, were significantly up-regulated by chitin or flg22 treatment. In contrast, ubiquitination levels were down-regulated for nine receptors or protein kinases. Understanding how the ubiquitination of these proteins is regulated will help reveal how the ubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors or protein kinases contributes to plant immunity. Researchers recently found, for example, that receptor OsRLCK176 is negatively regulated by OsCPK4 and that activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit can suppress OsRLCK176 ubiquitination to coordinate plant immunity (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When attacked by pathogens, ROS rapidly accumulate as part of the defense responses, while ROS-detoxifying enzymes are synthesized to balance the cellular redox changes (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mendoza, 2011</xref>). Cellular redox homeostasis changes rapidly, and dynamic changes in the protein levels involved in ROS production and ROS-detoxifying enzymes are essential for responses to biotic or abiotic stresses. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation allows the rapid regulation of protein levels, and we have identified a large number of proteins involved in ROS production or detoxification and that have significantly down-regulated ubiquitination following chitin or flg22 treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Ubiquitination of Phenylpropanoid Pathway Enzymes Is Significantly Elevated During Rice Defense Responses</title><p>Our results revealed that regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway by ubiquitination is associated with plant innate immunity. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis converts <sc>L</sc>-phenylalanine into a range of aromatic metabolites that act as antioxidants, contributing to detoxification, or that act as signaling molecules to mediate defense responses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Fraser and Chapple, 2011</xref>). Multiple mechanisms have been reported to control the activity of the phenylpropanoid pathway rate-limiting enzyme PAL (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Vogt, 2010</xref>). PAL activity has also been shown to be induced transiently in response to biotic or abiotic stimuli as an early defense response by <italic>de novo</italic> mRNA synthesis and at the transcriptional level (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 1989</xref>). Other phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes are also regulated at the transcriptional level in response to biotic and abiotic stress (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 1989</xref>). Recently, several phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, including AtPAL-1, -2, and -3, were found to be potentially ubiquitinated in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kim D.Y. et al., 2013</xref>), and (poly)ubiquitination of four <italic>A. thaliana</italic> PAL isoforms was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to OsPAL1, OsPAL2, OsPAL5, and OsPAL7, we found that the ubiquitination levels of other phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes, including Os4CL3, OsC4HL, OsCHS1, OsCOMT1, and OsF5H, were significantly greater after 3 h stimulation with chitin or flg22. Whether these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system in response to pathogen infection remains to be determined.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the systematic identification of ubiquitination targets in rice plants treated by PAMPs revealed the diversity and complexity of the defense responses involving the ubiquitination system. The ubiquitination system likely plays a critical role in fine-tuning PTI. The large pool of ubiquitination targets identified here will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how the ubiquitination system regulates defense responses upon pathogen attack.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>X-LC performed most of the experiments, data processing, and bioinformatics analyses.
