    "The diversity in plant metabolites with improved phytonutrients is essential to achieve global food security and sustainable crop yield. Our study using computational metabolomics genome wide association study (cmGWAS) reports on a comprehensive profiling of threonine (Thr) metabolite in rice. Sixteen abiotic stress responsive (AbSR) - Thr metabolite producing genes (ThrMPG), modulate metabolite levels and play a significant role determining both physiological and nutritional importance of rice. These AbSR-ThrMPG were computationally analysed for their protein properties using OryzaCyc through plant metabolic network analyser. A total of 1373 and 1028 SNPs were involved in complex traits and genomic variations. Comparative mapping of AbSR-ThrMPG revealed the chromosomal colinearity with C4 grass species. Further, computational expression pattern of these genes predicted a differential expression profiling in diverse developmental tissues. Protein interaction of protein coding gene sequences revealed that the abiotic stresses (AbS) are multigenic in nature. In silico expression of AbSR-ThrMPG determined the putative involvement in response to individual AbS. This is the first comprehensive genome wide study reporting on AbSR -ThrMPG analysis in rice. The results of this study provide a pivotal resource for further functional investigation of these key genes in the vital areas of manipulating AbS signaling in rice improvement."
