    "Cellulose synthase-like CslF and CslH genes have been implicated in the biosynthesis of β-glucans, a major cell wall constituents in grasses and cereals. The low β-glucan content of durum wheat and lack of information of the biosynthesis pathway make the expression analysis in different developmental stages of grain endosperm an interesting tool for the crop genetic improvement. Specific genome sequences of wheat CslF6 and CslH were isolated and the genomic sequence and structure were analysed in the cv. Svevo. In starchy endosperm at five developmental stages (6, 12, 21, 28 and 40 days after pollination) CslF6 and CslH transcripts were differentially expressed. A peak of CslF6 transcription occurred at 21 dap, while CslH was abundant at 28 dap. Significant variations were detected for both the genes in the genotypes. Significant and positive correlation were detected between β-glucan content and CslF6 gene expression at 21 dap and 40 dap, while no significant correlation was observed for CslH gene. On the overall, our correlation analysis reflected data from previous studies on other species highlighting how the abundance of transcripts encoding for CslF6 and CslH enzymes were not necessarily a good indicator of enzyme activity and/or β-glucan deposition in cell wall."
