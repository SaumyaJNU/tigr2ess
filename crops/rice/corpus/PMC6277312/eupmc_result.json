    "Mulberry leaf (ML) has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on Î±-glucosidase, and suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia, which may be related to its deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) content. This study was conducted to investigate the hypoglycemic and dyslipidemic effects of rice coated with ML rich in DNJ in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. The mice were divided into four groups (n = 8 each): non-diabetic normal control (NC); diabetic control (DM-C), fed with 10% polished rice powder (DM-R); and fed with 10% polished rice powder coated with DNJ-rich ML (DM-DNJR). Supplementation with DNJR for six weeks decreased levels of fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and blood glycosylated hemoglobin; conversely, levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol showed an increase in the same treatment. In addition, weights of mesenteric, epididymal, and total adipose tissues decreased with DNJR supplementation, when compared with diabetic control db/db mice, while maltase, lactase, and sucrase activity in the small intestine were inhibited. The anti-diabetic effects were marginally greater in the DM-DNJR group than in the DM-R group. These results suggest that rice coated with ML rich in DNJ can reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in db/db mice, and may prove useful for individuals with diabetes."
