    "Crop productivity and stability of the food system are threatened by climate change, mainly through the effects of predicted abiotic stresses. Despite extensive research on abiotic stress tolerance in the past decades, the successful translation of these research to fields/farmers is scarce. The impelling demand of climate resilient varieties, and the poor translation of research into the field despite the availability of high throughput technologies lead us to critically analyse a neglected aspect of current abiotic stress tolerance research. Although environmental factors play the most important role in the development of adaptive traits of plants, most abiotic stress tolerance research ignores eco-geographic aspects of highly stress tolerant accessions. In this review, we critically examined the geographic distribution pattern of highly tolerant rice accessions of all major abiotic stresses along with one micronutrient deficiency. Remarkably, we identified a shared geographic distribution pattern of highly tolerant accessions for all abiotic stresses including zinc deficiency despite the sparseness of highly tolerant accessions. The majority of these tolerant accessions predominately originated from Bangladesh centred narrow geographic region. We therefore analysed the climatic and agro-ecological features of Bangladesh. Considering the threat of climate change on global food security and poverty, urgent concerted research efforts are necessary for the development of climate resilient rice varieties utilizing the technological advancement, know-hows, and the preferential distribution pattern of abiotic stress tolerant rice."
