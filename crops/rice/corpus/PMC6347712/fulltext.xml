To better understand this biology, we characterized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as their differentiated parental or rederived counterparts. We confirmed that only iPSCs failed to respond to viral RNA, IFN-I, or viral infection. This lack of response could be phenocopied in fibroblasts with the expression of a reprogramming factor which repressed the capacity to induce canonical antiviral pathways. To ascertain the consequences of restoring the antiviral response in the context of pluripotency, we engineered a system to engage these defenses in iPSCs. Inducible expression of a recombinant virus-activated transcription factor resulted in the successful reconstitution of antiviral defenses through the direct up-regulation of IFN-I&#x02013;stimulated genes. Induction of the antiviral signature in iPSCs, even for a short duration, resulted in the dysregulation of genes associated with all three germ layers despite maintaining pluripotency markers. Trilineage differentiation of these same cells showed that engagement of the antiviral defenses compromised ectoderm and endoderm formation and dysregulated the development of mesodermal sublineages. In all, these data suggest that the temporal induction of the antiviral response primes iPSCs away from pluripotency and induces numerous aberrant gene products upon differentiation. Together these results suggest that the IFN-I system and pluripotency may be incompatible with each other and thus explain why stem cells do not utilize the canonical antiviral system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>IRF7</kwd><kwd>KLF4</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (DIR, NIAID)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100006492</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">AI007647-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Julie Eggenberger</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Benjamin R.

From bacteria to mammals, cells that comprise every form of life have evolved defense systems to minimize infection. This evolutionary arms race has generated immense diversity in all three domains of life (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In mammals, this process has resulted in a stratified defense platform composed of type I IFN (IFN-I)-mediated effector proteins (intrinsic), a population of specialized cells that react nonspecifically to pathogens (innate), and a multifaceted and highly specific response (adaptive). While the innate and adaptive immune systems are enabled by distinct cellular populations, the intrinsic response is thought to be relatively uniform in vertebrate cells. In response to virus infection, unique hallmarks of replication such as: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RNA containing 5&#x02032; di- or triphosphates, or cytoplasmic DNA can all be recognized by specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Engagement of these so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to their cognate PRRs induces a cascade of events that ultimately culminate in the transcriptional activation of the IFN response factors (IRFs)&#x02014;most notably IRF3 and IRF7. Activation of these IRF members induces the transcriptional activation of interferon beta (IFNB), a key member of the IFN-I system, as well as many antiviral effector proteins directly (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Production and secretion of IFNB functions to prime uninfected cells through a second transcriptional pathway involving both IRF- and STAT-based transcription factors (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Together, this complex, denoted as IFN-Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) is responsible for the up-regulation of hundreds of genes that interfere with transcription, translation, and transport in an effort to slow and/or inhibit virus replication (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Collectively, these genes are referred to as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). This vertebrate-specific ISG response is effective enough to completely protect cells from the cytopathic effects of many viruses and is broadly conserved among vertebrates (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In stark contrast to differentiated cells, pluripotent stem cells lack the capacity to respond to extracellular viral or bacterial PAMPs (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). While this phenotype has been proposed to be, in part, due to low levels of PRRs, a comprehensive understanding as to why the IFN-I system is not utilized in these cells still remains incomplete (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Moreover, iPSCs not only fail to induce IFN-I in response to infection, IFN-I treatment of these cells also yields little transcriptional response (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Despite this phenotype, iPSCs do not demonstrate hypersusceptability to virus infection, an activity that has been credited to a wide variety of mechanisms including: iPSC-specific factors, RNA interference (RNAi), and the high baseline levels of a subset of ISGs (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>As the precise mechanisms underlying why pluripotent stem cells fail to induce a robust transcriptional response to virus remain somewhat unclear, here we focused on how reprogramming induces this phenotype and why the canonical IFN-I system is not utilized. To this end, we established a primary cell model in which differentiated fibroblasts could be made pluripotent and then redifferentiated back to a fibroblast lineage. We demonstrate that there is an inverse correlation between a functioning IFN-I system and the maintenance of pluripotency. Moreover, we find that of the four factors required for the generation of iPSCs, Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), could repress antiviral induction through the direct engagement of IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). To further understand the basis for this phenotype, we established an iPSC model in which we could induce the expression of a constitutively active version of IRF7, a strong transactivator of ISREs (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the absence of induction, these cells were indistinguishable from untreated or GFP-expressing cells but, upon activation, a significant subset of ISGs could be observed. In addition to ISGs, temporal expression of this IRF7&#x00394; transcriptional program resulted in dysregulation of many pluripotency and lineage-specific genes in both resting and differentiated iPSCs. Taken together, these data suggest that the IFN-I system is incompatible with maintaining a pluripotent state and may explain why these cells fail to utilize such a successful intrinsic defense system.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Demonstrate a Diminished Response to Virus-Related Signals.</title><p>To investigate the ability of stem cells to respond to virus infection, we utilized a model system from which human primary foreskin fibroblasts (FFs) were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC<sup>FF</sup>) utilizing lentiviruses expressing <italic>OCT4</italic> (POU class 5 homeobox 1), <italic>SOX2</italic> (SRY-box 2), <italic>KLF4</italic>, and <italic>c-MYC</italic> (MYC protooncogene) (referred to as OSKM) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812449116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1 <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic></ext-link><bold>)</bold> (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

These data demonstrated that in contrast to fibroblasts, iPSCs failed to induce a response to either pppRNA or IFNB. These dynamics were also reflected in the small RNA profiles of resting or pppRNA-treated cellular populations, suggesting neither miRNAs, nor virus-induced small RNAs, were involved in this biology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812449116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>).

Sequence and cluster analyses of IAVdelNS1-infected cells at 8 h postinfection demonstrated a robust antiviral response in FFs as well as a dramatically diminished induction of a small subset of ISGs in iPSCs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812449116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S3</ext-link>). In contrast to the canonical ISG profile following IFNB stimulation, infection with IAVdelNS1 in FF cells also induced many other transcriptional changes that were equally absent in iPSCs&#x02014;further demonstrating their lack of response to virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, when examining virus levels, we find that iPSCs maintained a relatively effective response, given the lack of antiviral employment, a phenotype likely due to the high baseline levels of ISGs in these cells as reported elsewhere (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812449116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2 <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></ext-link>) (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Given the previous results, we predicted that upon pretreatment with IFNB and subsequent viral challenge, we would see limited protection in iPSCs compared with our fibroblasts. To test this, we treated cells with IFNB for 12 h before infection with IAVdelNS1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of two for 6 and 12 h. As anticipated, IFNB treatment resulted in the up-regulation of STAT1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) and IFIT1 in fibroblasts, and complete protection from IAVdelNS1 challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, iPSCs treated with IFNB failed to control IAVdelNS1-mediated production of viral nucleoprotein (NP), correlating with a lack of STAT1 and IFIT1 up-regulation. Upon examination of the phosphorylation status of IRF3 and STAT1, corresponding to their activated states, we find diminished levels of both S386 and Y701, respectively, suggesting iPSCs may harbor a dominant negative factor that represses this response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p>To validate this phenotype across species and to ensure this phenotype was not the product of the nonphysiological process of &#x0201c;dedifferentiation,&#x0201d; we also looked at sensitivity of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to virus infection and IFNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). These analyses revealed that, comparable to our iPSC model, mESCs failed to control virus levels of NP or induce IFIT1 or IFIT2 in response to either IFNB or virus infection. This is in contrast to primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which demonstrated a robust IFNB response. Moreover, while IAVdelNS1 does not replicate well in MEFs, we do observe a complete loss of NP signal following the treatment of IFNB. These data corroborate our RNA-Seq analyses and further suggest that pluripotent stem cells do not respond to virus infection using the canonical IFN-I response. Moreover, the shared phenotypes between iPSCs and mESCs suggest a generalizability to this phenomenon and point to a greater underlying reason as to why it is implemented.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Defining the Interplay Between Cellular Reprogramming and Induction of the Antiviral State.</title><p>IFNB induction relies on the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 which bind to two adjacent ISREs just upstream of the transcriptional start site (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). IRF7, like IRF3, requires phosphorylation by the IKK-related kinases to relieve its autoinhibition&#x02014;a process which can be bypassed through the deletion of residues 247&#x02013;467, a construct herein referred to as IRF7&#x00394; (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast to IRF3, which is expressed ubiquitously and only engages perfect ISREs, IRF7 levels are induced in response to virus and can activate ISREs that deviate from the consensus by two to three bases, increasing its transcriptional footprint. This promiscuous activity of IRF7 ultimately results in generating a greater array of transcriptional targets and is responsible for the stochastic expression of IFNB as its ISREs deviate from the canonical sequence (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). For this reason, IRF7 is often referred to as the &#x0201c;master regulator&#x0201d; of the IFN-I system as it is sufficient to both induce IFN-I and protect cells from virus infection by directly up-regulating a large subset of ISGs in an IFN-I&#x02013;independent manner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812449116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S3 <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic> and Table S4</ext-link>) (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the molecular basis for the lack of response to virus in iPSCs, we next utilized the reprogramming factors that enable their biology. To this end, we coexpressed OCT4, SOX2, and KFL4 together with IRF7&#x00394; and monitored endogenous expression of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic> (IFN-Stimulated Gene 15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Interestingly, these data revealed that each of the three factors could repress IRF7&#x00394; with KLF4 being the most potent. These data are consistent with recent reports that these three transcription factors can cause significant chromatin remodeling and can compact the DNA thus restricting transcriptional induction (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

Stem cell potency itself exists as a gradient, with totipotent cells having the greatest potential, followed by pluripotent, multipotent, unipotent, and finally differentiated cells (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Pluripotent cells maintain the capacity to differentiate into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, whereas multipotent stem cells are limited to self-renewal and the capacity to develop into multiple cell types present in a specific tissue or organ (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>The cellular genes involved in both differentiation and defense are vast in number and show a high propensity of duplication events exemplified by the family of hox or IFN genes, respectively (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Perhaps even more noteworthy is the fact that these two systems, development and defense, often borrow from each other over an evolutionary time course. For example, Toll like receptors, while required for development in many invertebrates, were repurposed to be PRRs in vertebrates (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Conversely, antiviral RNAi systems of early eukaryotes were independently duplicated to generate developmental miRNA systems in plants and animals (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). As biology tends to repurpose the old rather than generate de novo material (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), one can observe many gene duplications for cellular components involved in one or even both of these two systems [i.e., bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (<italic>BST2</italic>/tetherin) which also serve to aggregate viruses at the cells lipid bilayer] (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Given this relationship, it is tempting to speculate that these two systems maintain a complex relationship which renders pluripotency and defense genes at odds with each other. This concept is supported by the fact that in contrast to pluripotent stem cells, multipotent adult stem cells which have enabled development expression profiles become responsive to IFN-I, suggesting that lineage commitment rapidly restores their innate antiviral program (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that KLF4, and to a lesser extent SOX2 and OCT4, are incompatible with the transcriptional potential of IRF7, a master regulator of the antiviral defenses. Given that the binding motifs for these reprogramming factors do not overlap with that of an ISRE, we can assume that this phenotype is an indirect consequence of downstream target genes. Given that RNA-Seq data show no overt loss of read numbers to transcripts associated with initiating the antiviral response, we postulate that the accessibility to ISREs must be restricted as a result of chromatin remodeling, a concept supported by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-Seq) data (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, while this idea explains the lack of transcriptional induction, it fails to address the low levels of phosphorylation of IRF3, NF-&#x003ba;B, or STAT1 observed by us, and others (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).

While pluripotent cells are physically protected within a blastocyst, vertical transmission of pathogens to these cells can occur by several routes including infection of the surrounding trophoblasts as recently exemplified by Zika virus (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Given this, the threat of vertical transmission suggests there would be value in having the capacity to elicit an antiviral response in pluripotent cells and, indeed two independent groups have found pluripotent stem cells harbor high baseline levels of specific ISGs to help minimize infection (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, as effective as a handful of constitutive ISGs may be at combating a subset of viruses, this minimal defense strategy cannot substitute for the full breadth of the IFN-I response.</p><p>Here we sought to determine what the consequences would be should this defense be artificially induced. Our logic was that the consequences of induction may illustrate why the intrinsic defenses are not utilized in what are arguably the most important cells. To this end, we engineered iPSCs to express IFN-I&#x02013;related genes through a constitutively active transcript of IRF7. We found this strategy to successfully induce an antiviral-like response in iPSCs&#x02014;a phenotype that we could not accomplish through any other means. Induction of IRF7 successfully induced many ISGs in agreement with its capacity to engage a wide variety of ISREs and was sufficient to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of virus infection. However, even with only a partial antiviral response, we observed immediate effects on the morphology of iPSCs in response to IRF7 expression. Moreover, changes in morphology also coincided with extensive transcriptional activity that was indirect from IRF7 that seemingly pushed cells away from pluripotency and, in the case of our iPSCs, toward the mesoderm lineage. Based on our data, it is clear that IRF7 primes cells to exit pluripotency, but it remains to be determined whether the bias toward mesoderm is specific or is additionally influenced by the baseline tendency of a given iPSC line.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented here support the hypothesis that engagement of any aspect of the antiviral response may be incompatible with maintaining pluripotency. These observations not only aid in our understanding as to why these specialized cells remain inert with regards to intrinsic defenses, but it also may explain why developmentally they are compartmentalized within trophoblasts which harbor a number of unique antiviral defense mechanisms (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In all, it would appear that the complexities of maintaining pluripotency are incompatible with the induction of the many antiviral effectors that comprise the IFN-based system. While the basis for this incompatibly is likely multifactorial, it is tempting to speculate that the crosstalk that has occurred between developmental and defense systems over the past 2.5 million years of vertebrate evolution may preclude the simultaneous engagement of these two programs under any circumstance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>iPSC Cell Lines.</title><p>Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> were generated from primary FFs using a lentivirus expressing NANOG, SOX2, OCT4, and cMYC and selected for TRA-1&#x02013;60 expression.
