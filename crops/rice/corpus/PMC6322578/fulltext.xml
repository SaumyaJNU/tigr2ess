Its biosynthesis is catalyzed and regulated by co-ordinated actions of several enzymes. Recently, a factor termed Protein Targeting to Starch 1 (PTST1) was identified as being required for correct granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) localization and demonstrated to be crucial for amylose synthesis in Arabidopsis. However, the function of its homologous protein in storage tissues (e.g. endosperm) is unknown. We identified a PTST1 homolog in barley and it was found to contain a crucial coiled-coil domain and carbohydrate-binding module. We demonstrated the interaction between PTST1 and GBSS1 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in barley endosperm. By tagging PTST1 with the fluorophore mCherry, we observed that it is localized in the stroma of barley endosperm amyloplasts. PTST1 overexpression in endosperm increased endogenous <italic>gbss1a</italic> gene expression and amylose content. <italic>Gbss1a</italic> and <italic>ptst1</italic> mutants were generated using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-related protein 9 (Cas9)-based targeted mutagenesis. Homozygous <italic>gbss1a</italic> mutants showed a waxy phenotype. Grains of <italic>ptst1</italic> mutants did not accumulate any starch. These grains dried out during the desiccation stage and were unable to germinate, suggesting that PTST1 is essential for development of starchy endosperm and viable grains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Barley</kwd><kwd>cereal grain</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>GBSS</kwd><kwd>PTST1</kwd><kwd>starch biosynthesis</kwd><kwd><italic>waxy</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Starch biosynthesis in plants requires the co-ordinated actions of several enzymes, including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), soluble starch synthase (SSS), starch branching enzyme, starch debranching enzyme, glucan water dikinase, and starch phosphorylase (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Blennow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). After converting glucose-1-phosphate to activated glucosyl donor ADP-glucose by AGPase, amylose and amylopectin are produced by the involvement of GBSS and SSS, respectively. In cereal endosperm, various isoforms of SS have been identified: GBSS, SSI, SSII, SSIII, and SSIV (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">James <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). SSI, SSII, and SSIII elongate short, medium, and long chains of amylopectin, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), while SSIV seems to be involved in initiation of starch granules (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Toyosawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Of the two currently identified GBSS isoforms, GBSSII functions in non-storage plant tissues such as leaf, whereas the role of GBSSI is mostly confined to storage tissues such as the seed endosperm (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Dian <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hirose and Terao, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Based on metabolic diurnal dynamics, two types of starch can be identified. Transient starch is synthesized mainly in leaves during the day and degraded at night to provide carbon for non-photosynthetic metabolism. Storage starch is accumulated in storage tissue including developing seeds and tubers, and serves as a long-term carbon store mainly for germination. Due to their different physiological functions, the mechanisms for starch biosynthesis in storage and transient tissues are significantly different. For example, in Arabidopsis, Protein Targeting to Starch 2 (PTST2) mediates interaction between SSIV and MOS for initiation of transient leaf starch granules (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). <italic>Ptst2</italic> mutants contain none or a single large starch granule in chloroplasts, while the wild type typically contains 5&#x02013;7 granules. In rice endosperm, a homolog of PTST2 was identified as FLO6 (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), which plays a different role in starch biosynthesis from that in Arabidopsis. FLO6 interacts with ISA1, and the <italic>flo6</italic> mutants produce three types of abnormal amyloplasts, each with either no starch granules or large numbers of tiny granules and abolished compound structures. Even for storage tissues in cereals, the homologous genes involved in starch biosynthesis in different species may function in different ways. The same homologous mutant of <italic>ptst2</italic> in barley, identified as <italic>fra</italic>, contains fractured starch granules rather than an altered number of starch granules (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is important to characterize the function of PTST homologs in different cereals and tissues.</p><p>GBSSI is encoded by the <italic>waxy</italic> (<italic>wx</italic>) locus. Mutants carrying defects in the GBSSI/WAXY gene have been isolated in many species, including wheat (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), maize (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Shure <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>), rice (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), and potato (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Hovenkamp-Hermelink <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>), all of which produce amylose-free starch granules. Waxy cereals offer a valuable starch quality for foods without seriously jeopardizing total starch contents or grain yield. For example, <italic>indica</italic> waxy rice is used in rice tamale and rice pudding for its tenderness, while <italic>japonica</italic> waxy rice is used for sweetened rice cakes due to its stickiness (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Villareal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Biscuits baked with partially waxy wheat flour show higher sensory scores than those with normal flour (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, waxy starches are used in paper manufacturing, where clear, consistent gels are required (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Jobling, 2004</xref>).</p><p>GBSS-type enzymes represent the majority of the protein fraction bound to storage starch granules (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, they do not contain known types of starch-binding domains nor have they been shown to form complexes with other soluble starch synthases or starch branching enzymes containing carbohydrate-binding domains (CBMs) (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Tetlow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). HvGBSSIa from the barley cultivar CDC Alamo showed deficient targeting to starch granules. This deficient targeting results in a waxy phenotype even though GBSS enzymes are expressed normally (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hebelstrup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In Arabidopsis, targeting of GBSS to transient leaf starch granules has been shown to be dependent on interaction with PTST, which is a 26 kDa protein containing a glucan-binding module family 48, CBM48 (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). PTST genes are highly conserved, and homologous genes exist in cereal genomes. However, it is not known whether PTST1 interacts with GBSS1a in cereals, or if it has a function in storage starch biosynthesis.</p><p>We studied the function of PTST1 in starch biosynthesis in barley endosperm. The interaction of PTST1 and GBSS1a in endosperm was confirmed by FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer). PTST1 overexpressors showed higher gene expression of both <italic>ptst1</italic> and <italic>gbss1a</italic> mRNA in endosperm at different development stages and they had an increased content of amylose. We also generated <italic>gbss1a</italic> and <italic>ptst1</italic> loss-of-function mutant plants and grains by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-related protein 9 (Cas9). The endosperms of <italic>gbss1a</italic> mutants were amylose-free, while <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant endosperms contained increased sugar levels and had no starch accumulation. Homozygous <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant grains did not survive desiccation and could therefore not generate progeny. Our results suggest that PTST1 is not only involved in amylose biosynthesis by interacting with GBSS1a, as in Arabidopsis, but is generally essential for development of starchy endosperm in barley grains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Molecular phylogenetic analyses</title><p>The amino acid sequence of AtPTST1 was used to search different proteomic databases including National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</ext-link>) and Ensemblplants databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plants.ensembl.org/;">http://plants.ensembl.org/;</ext-link> for barley and wheat).

Some endosperms of T<sub>1</sub> grains showed a unique phenotype with only sugar and no starch being accumulated during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>ptst1</italic> homozygous endosperm dries out during the desiccation stage. Unfortunately, we could not extract genomic DNA from developing homozygous mutant grains so the mutant phenotype could not be matched with a homozygous genotype directly. Reverse proof was provided by the observation that genotypes of wild phenotype endosperms were either wild type or heterozygous with a segregation ratio of 1:2 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the starch-free endosperms could be homozygous mutants. In addition, fewer hygromycin-resistant T<sub>0</sub> plants of <italic>ptst1</italic> knock-outs (2.2%) were obtained than of <italic>gbss1a</italic> knock-outs (6.0%). We obtained two homozygous <italic>gbss1a</italic> knock-out plants, while no homozygous <italic>ptst1</italic> knock-out plants were found in the T<sub>0</sub> generation. It is possible that homozygous <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant seedlings regenerated from callus do not survive. This is substantiated by the low regeneration frequency (1.7%) of plants with CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of the PTST1 gene. We did not observe a dramatic increment of glucose in <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant endosperms. One explanation is that when on the same spike there are mutant, heterozygous, and wild-type endosperms with a segregation ratio of 1:2:1, the glucose is transported to the other endosperms when the content in mutants is saturated. Our data showed that PTST1 is also expressed in barley leaves, indicating that it may have a function there.</p><p>It has been reported that SS4 is critical for starch granule initiation in both storage and transient starches (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Toyosawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Since SS4 itself in Arabidopsis does not possess a specialized CBM, the interaction with PTST2 provide access to a CBM that can bind suitable MOS substrates to initiate starch granules biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In barley, a homologous gene of <italic>ptst2</italic> was found and called <italic>fra</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). However, the <italic>fra</italic> mutant only produced fractured starch granules and an opaque phenotype rather than a decrease in starch granule number, suggesting that FRA does not interact with SS4 to mediate starch granule initiation in barley endosperm. Therefore, the starch-free phenotype we found for the <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant in barley could be due to the interaction between PTST1 and SS4. In Arabidopsis leaves, PTST1 only interacts with GBSS1a and the <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant produces amylose-free leaves (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Seung <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, in barley endosperm, we have demonstrated that <italic>ptst1</italic> plays a crucial role for development of starchy endosperm since the <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant produces non-viable grain with starch-free endosperm. Extensive screens for amylose-free mutants have been conducted in barley, but no <italic>ptst1</italic> mutant alleles have so far been isolated. Our data suggest that it is because this mutant is lethal.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s26"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Table S1.
