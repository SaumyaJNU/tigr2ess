    "Roots are fundamentally important for growth and development, anchoring the plant to its growth substrate, facilitating water and nutrient uptake from the soil, and sensing and responding to environmental signals such as biotic and abiotic stresses. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling root architecture is essential for improving nutrient uptake efficiency and crop yields. In this review, we describe the progress being made in the identification of genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of root systems in rice (Oryza sativa L.), including crown roots, lateral roots, root hairs, and root length. Genes involved in the adaptation of roots to the environmental nutrient status are reviewed, and strategies for further study and agricultural applications are discussed. The growth and development of rice roots are controlled by both genetic factors and environmental cues. Plant hormones, especially auxin and cytokinin, play important roles in root growth and development. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating root architecture and response to environmental signals can contribute to the genetic improvement of crop root systems, enhancing their adaptation to stressful environmental conditions."
