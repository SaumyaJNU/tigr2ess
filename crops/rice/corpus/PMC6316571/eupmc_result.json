    "Copper (Cu) is involved in fundamental biological processes for plant growth and development. However, Cu excess is harmful to plants. Thus, Cu in plant tissues must be tightly regulated. In this study, we found that the peanut Yellow Stripe-Like family gene AhYSL3.1 is involved in Cu transport. Among five AhYSL genes, AhYSL3.1 and AhYSL3.2 were upregulated by Cu deficiency in peanut roots and expressed mainly in young leaves. A yeast complementation assay suggested that the plasma membrane-localized AhYSL3.1 was a Cu-nicotianamine complex transporter. High expression of AhYSL3.1 in tobacco and rice plants with excess Cu resulted in a low concentration of Cu in young leaves. These transgenic plants were resistant to excess Cu. The above results suggest that AhYSL3.1 is responsible for the internal transport of Cu in peanut."
