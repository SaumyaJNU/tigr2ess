Cas12a-mediated genome editing is temperature sensitive in plants, but a lack of a comprehensive understanding on Cas12a temperature sensitivity in plant cells has hampered effective application of Cas12a nucleases in plant genome editing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We compared AsCas12a, FnCas12a, and LbCas12a for their editing efficiencies and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair profiles at four different temperatures in rice. We found that AsCas12a is more sensitive to temperature and that it requires a temperature of over 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for high activity. Each Cas12a nuclease exhibited distinct indel mutation profiles which were not affected by temperatures. For the first time, we successfully applied AsCas12a for generating rice mutants with high frequencies up to 93% among T0 lines. We next pursued editing in the dicot model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for which Cas12a-based genome editing has not been previously demonstrated. While LbCas12a barely showed any editing activity at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, its editing activity was rescued by growing the transgenic plants at 29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. With an early high-temperature treatment regime, we successfully achieved germline editing at the two target genes, GL2 and TT4, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic lines. We then used high-temperature treatment to improve Cas12a-mediated genome editing in maize. By growing LbCas12a T0 maize lines at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, we obtained Cas12a-edited mutants at frequencies up to 100% in the T1 generation. Finally, we demonstrated DNA binding of Cas12a was not abolished at lower temperatures by using a dCas12a-SRDX-based transcriptional repression system in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Our study demonstrates the use of high-temperature regimes to achieve high editing efficiencies with Cas12a systems in rice, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and maize and sheds light on the mechanism of temperature sensitivity for Cas12a in plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12915-019-0629-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CRISPR-Cas12a</kwd><kwd>Temperature</kwd><kwd>Genome editing</kwd><kwd>Rice</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd>Maize</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1758745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330017</award-id><award-id>31771486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012556</institution-id><institution>Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017JQ0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Transgenic Major Project </institution></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX08022001-003</award-id><award-id>2018ZX08022001-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRAG 2016-06247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Kan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011929</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>593603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Many genome editing outcomes are achieved through sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) which generate targeted DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). SSNs such as zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) were widely applied in genome editing in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in recent years, these SSNs have been overtaken by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) systems with Cas9 or Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) nucleases that mediate DNA targeting through guide RNAs, which are easy to engineer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">CRISPR-Cas12a is an RNA-guided endonuclease that has provided new opportunities in genome editing through its distinct features from the commonly used CRISPR-Cas9 system. First, the PAM requirement for Cas12a is &#x0201c;TTTV&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;TTV,&#x0201d; which is advantageous for targeting promoters and other AT-rich sites in gene coding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cas12a requires only a ~&#x02009;43-nt guide CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and processes pre-crRNAs into mature RNAs, an ability that endows Cas12a systems with a natural multiplexing ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, Cas12a creates 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;bp staggered overhangs which may potentially facilitate gene replacement. Finally, Cas12a, unlike other nucleases such as Cas9, is not toxic in some organisms such as Chladymonas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which expands the spectrums of organisms that can benefit from genome editing. So far, three Cas12a varieties from different bacteria have been utilized for genome editing: <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> (FnCas12a), <italic>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic> (LbCas12a), and <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> sp. <italic>BV3L6</italic> (AsCas12a), and all of them have been tested in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Once a DSB is created by Cas12a or other type of endonucleases, it must be repaired through one of the two main repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is the most commonly utilized pathway and often results in insertion/deletions (indels) that knock out targeted genes. Cas12a genome editing based on NHEJ has been demonstrated in a few plant species. In rice, editing was achieved at 12.1% mutation frequency using a small RNA promoter (OsU3) and a tRNA processing system to express crRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By using a full-length repeat-spacer-repeat sequence and allowing LbCas12a&#x02019;s endogenous processing system to create mature crRNA, mutation frequencies up to 41.2% were achieved in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, edited T0 plants were mostly heterozygous or chimeric and no homozygous plants were observed. We were able to achieve 100% mutation frequency in rice T0 plants using a double-ribozyme system with both Cas12a and crRNA under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter (pZmUbi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In protoplasts, LbCas12a had an efficiency of 15&#x02013;25%, while AsCas12a ranged from 0.6 to 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The low editing efficiency of AsCas12a is consistent with previous results: one study could not detect any activity in rice T0 plants with AsCas12a and the other barely found AsCas12a-induced mutations in soybean protoplasts even when deep sequencing analysis was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Efficient maize genome editing up to 60% in T0 generation has also been achieved with LbCas12a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition to LbCas12a, efficient editing has been shown by FnCas12a in rice and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, we showed LbCas12a and FnCas12a were very specific for DNA targeting in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Using whole-genome sequencing, we could not detect any off-target mutations when targeting three sites in rice by LbCas12a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], further demonstrating its high specificity.</p><p id="Par7">In order to bolster Cas12a efficiency and expand its targeting scopes, two aspects were addressed respectively: crRNA design and PAM requirements. Because crRNAs for Cas12a are shorter than the single-guide RNAs for Cas9, undesired secondary structures noticeably decrease efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or even render the crRNA non-functional as we showed in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Online tools CINDEL and CRISPR-DT can aid in crRNA design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Originally, FnCas12a was believed to have a PAM requirement of &#x0201c;TTV&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this was questioned by two recent studies in human and rice cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lately, LbCas12a-RR and LbCas12a-RVR variants working at &#x0201c;CCCC,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;TYCV,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;TATG&#x0201d; sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] were demonstrated in rice for expanded targeting scopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Cas12a has genome editing applications beyond DSB generation; for example, Cas12a can recruit activators, repressors, or deaminases to the target site for either transcriptional regulation or base editing. We previously reported AsCas12a- and LbCas12a-based repressors that repressed <italic>miR159b</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to less than 10% of wild-type (WT) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, although AsCas12a was less efficient than LbCas12a in creating mutations, as a repressor, it was more consistent than LbCas12a in binding the targeted promoter to repress expression. While no reports have been published in plants, Cas12a-based transcriptional activators and base editors were successfully demonstrated in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Cas12a nucleases and their engineered variants have been shown to efficiently and specifically cleave and bind DNA when crRNAs and processing systems are well designed. However, the pace of adoption of Cas12a systems to a wide collection of plant species has been slow, suggesting possible barriers for Cas12a technologies. One major barrier could be temperature as it was recently shown to affect Cas12a editing efficiency in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, Cas9 editing was previously demonstrated to be impacted by temperature and higher temperatures helped achieve high editing efficiency in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and citrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Given plant transformation and growth are typically carried out at ambient temperatures (e.g., 20 to 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), we reasoned that the difficulty of applying Cas12a nucleases in plants could be due to the fact that they are more temperature sensitive than Cas9. In this study, we systematically investigated this topic. Our results not only demonstrated that different Cas12a nucleases have differential activities and sensitivities to temperature in different plant species, but also shed light on the mechanism of temperature sensitivity for Cas12a.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Temperature sensitivity of three Cas12a nucleases in rice cells</title><p id="Par10">To investigate temperature sensitivity of AsCas12a, FnCas12a, and LbCas12a, we targeted <italic>OsROC5</italic> and <italic>OsDEP1</italic> in rice protoplasts at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. In our system, both Cas12a and the crRNA were expressed under the maize ubiquitin promoter (pZmUbi) and the crRNA was precisely processed by hammerhead (HH) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Two biological replicates were first assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) before being submitted for deep sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For both targets, FnCas12a and LbCas12a were less sensitive to temperatures than AsCas12a. At 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the mutation frequencies for AsCas12a at both target sites were about 7%, much lower than the rates of FnCas12a and LbCas12a (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). The mutation frequencies by AsCas12a, however, were doubled when the transfected protoplasts were incubated at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, or 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The improvement on editing efficiency at higher temperatures was also observed for FnCas12a and LbCas12a, but less prominent when compared to AsCas12a (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, b). As a control, we also tested a SpCas9 construct targeting <italic>OsPDS</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Mutation frequencies by SpCas9 at the target site were the same at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and the frequency increased at 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Meanwhile, the rice protoplast transfection efficiencies using a DNA vector carrying a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene were comparable across four temperatures (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). The mutation frequencies in SpCas9 and some Cas12a samples decreased at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which was likely caused by heat-related cell abnormalities at this high temperature. The results suggest Cas12a nucleases, like SpCas9, are temperature sensitive in rice cells. A temperature of 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or higher is required for optimal Cas12a activity, while a higher temperature (e.g., 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) is required for optimal Cas9 activity. Notably, AsCas12a is the most temperature sensitive among the three Cas12a nucleases tested.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cas12a and Cas9 nuclease activities in rice protoplasts under different temperatures: 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

We showed that when transgenic maize lines expressing LbCas12a and crRNA were crossed to the WT plants, mutated T1 lines can be generated at a frequency as high as 100%, provided that the entire process of generating the T1 generation is done at a day time temperature of 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Many of the mutations discovered in the T1 lines are de novo generated new mutations. Our data were consistent with the recent report that new mutations could be generated in gametes or zygotes by Cas9 in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although we crossed our LbCas12a lines to WT, it is conceivable that we can also cross these transgenic lines to other transformation-recalcitrant maize varieties to knock out genes in different maize genetic backgrounds, as was shown previously with Cas9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Following our recent demonstration of LbCas12a in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the work here further streamlined an efficient LbCas12a system for targeted mutagenesis in maize.</p><p id="Par21">In addition, we showed that Cas9 is temperature sensitive in rice, which is consistent with the recent report that investigated this issue in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and citrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, Cas9 showed similar nuclease activities at 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and we started to see increased nuclease activity in rice protoplasts at 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Cas9 displayed optimal nuclease activity in human cells at 37&#x02009;&#x02013;39&#x02009;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and a heat stress of 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was applied for improving Cas9 editing in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In zebrafish, AsCas12a had poor activity at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and its activity was drastically improved by elevating the temperature to 34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. By contrast, we found Cas12a nucleases seem to reach optimal activities in plants at around 28&#x02013;29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which is more feasible given most plants grow in temperatures around 22&#x02013;29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. For example, we have grown rice and maize constantly at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and have treated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at 29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for up to ~&#x02009;4&#x02009;weeks continuously. However, lengthy and continuous treatment at 29&#x02009;&#x000b0;C significantly impedes <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth. Further exploration of heat treatment regimens will probably result in more robust genome editing in plants. Hence, while Cas12a nucleases are temperature sensitive, it should not be a barrier that prevents adoption of them for genome editing in many other plant species.</p><p id="Par22">A question remains, however, as why Cas12a-based genome editing is temperature sensitive. With the analysis of NHEJ mutations by all three Cas12a nucleases across four different temperatures, we ruled out the possible involvement of DNA repair pathways in this difference. Opposite effects of high temperatures on the activities of ZFN and TALEN versus CRISPR-Cas9 were reported in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which also suggested the effects were unlikely due to DNA repair machinery. Using a dLbCas12a-SRDX repressor, we further demonstrated that the DNA binding property of LbCas12a at lower temperatures is as good as, if not better than, higher temperatures. This is consistent with our previous observation that the dAsCas12a-SRDX repressor could work robustly in mediating targeted transcriptional repression at room temperature in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. While DNA binding is not significantly affected under these temperatures, it is still possible that chromatin structure is affected by temperature in a way that impacts the necessary conformation change of the Cas12a/crRNA ribonucleoprotein complex that is required for activation of nuclease activity, as supported by the data in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our data collectively points to a working hypothesis that Cas12a nuclease activity is affected by temperature. Upon activation, Cas12a proteins also unleash single-stranded DNase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We predict such non-specific DNase activities are likely also temperature sensitive. Finally, given that we have narrowed down the main cause of temperature sensitivity to Cas12 nuclease activities, it will be highly valuable and should also be possible to engineer Cas12a variants that are more active at lower temperatures, similar to engineering Cas12a variants with altered PAM specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which we and others have recently demonstrated in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>T-DNA vector construction</title><p id="Par23">T-DNA vectors for CRISPR-Cas9 were constructed based on the protocols described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].
