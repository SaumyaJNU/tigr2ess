Pokkali (Pok) is a highly salt-tolerant landrace, whereas IR29 is a salt-sensitive but widely cultivated genotype. Comparative analysis of these genotypes may offer a better understanding of the salinity tolerance mechanisms in rice. Although most stress-responsive genes are regulated at the transcriptional level, in many cases, changes at the transcriptional level are not always accompanied with the changes in protein abundance, which suggests that the transcriptome needs to be studied in conjunction with the proteome to link the phenotype of stress tolerance or sensitivity. Published reports have largely underscored the importance of transcriptional regulation during salt stress in these genotypes, but the regulation at the translational level has been rarely studied. Using RNA-Seq, we simultaneously analyzed the transcriptome and translatome from control and salt-exposed Pok and IR29 seedlings to unravel molecular insights into gene regulatory mechanisms that differ between these genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Clear differences were evident at both transcriptional and translational levels between the two genotypes even under the control condition. In response to salt stress, 57 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly upregulated at both transcriptional and translational levels in both genotypes; the overall number of up/downregulated DEGs in IR29 was comparable at both transcriptional and translational levels, whereas in Pok, the number of upregulated DEGs was considerably higher at the translational level (544 DEGs) than at the transcriptional level (219 DEGs); in contrast, the number of downregulated DEGs (58) was significantly less at the translational level than at the transcriptional level (397 DEGs). These results imply that Pok stabilizes mRNAs and also efficiently loads mRNAs onto polysomes for translation during salt stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">Under salt stress, Pok is more efficient in maintaining cell wall integrity, detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS), translocating molecules and maintaining photosynthesis. The present study confirmed the known salt stress-associated genes and also identified a number of putative new salt-responsive genes. Most importantly, the study revealed that the translational regulation under salinity plays an important role in salt-tolerant Pok, but such regulation was less evident in the salt-sensitive IR29.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-5279-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Polysomal RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>Rice</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>Salt stress</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>Translation</kwd></kwd-group><conference xlink:href="http://datamining-web.it.uts.edu.au/giw2018/"><conf-name>29th&#x000a0;International Conference on Genome Informatics</conf-name><conf-loc>Yunnan, China</conf-loc><conf-date>3-5 December 2018</conf-date></conference><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Soil salinity is one of the primary causes of yield decline in rice. An estimated 20% of cultivated land and 33% of irrigated agricultural land are afflicted by high salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, soil salinity has increased at an alarming rate worldwide, including in south and southeast Asian countries, where rice is widely grown. Salinity has a negative effect on crop production: even moderate salt stress can reduce crop yield substantially. The adverse effects of salinity on plants include Na<sup>+</sup> toxicity, osmotic and oxidative stresses as well as imbalance in ionic homeostasis, particularly K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Understanding the molecular basis of salt tolerance is a prerequisite for developing salt-tolerant rice varieties. Rice is endowed with rich genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Among diverse salt-tolerant rice genotypes, Pok is widely used as one of the best genotypes for dissecting salt tolerance in rice. On the other hand, IR29 is a modern, high-yielding cultivar but highly salt-sensitive genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Comparative analysis of these rice genotypes may lead to a better understanding of the salt tolerance mechanism at the molecular level.</p><p id="Par13">The regulation of gene expression in a cell operates at epigenomic, transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although most stress-responsive genes are regulated at the transcriptional level, in many cases changes at this level are not often reflected with a change in protein abundance, which suggests that transcriptional regulation does not always account for altered protein accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These observations also suggest that analysis of proteomic changes in addition to the transcriptome under stress is almost indispensable to link the phenotype with stress tolerance or sensitivity. Mass spectrometry-based analyses of the proteome is widely used to measure protein expression at the global scale. Alternatively, the translatome (mRNAs associated with polysomal fractions) could mimic the proteome component in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, high throughput sequencing of the translatome can identify genes with low expression that might be missed by proteomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Previous studies have apllied microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Pok and IR29 genotypes exposed to salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the sensitivity of microarray-based profiling is low for identifying genes with low expression and yet differentially responding to stress. RNA-Seq is highly sensitive and can identify genes that are low-abundantly expressed as well as novel genes, besides distinguishing the alternatively spliced variants. Besides the transcriptome, the analyses of proteome component is critically important to understand overall changes in protein regulation during stress. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to analyze transcriptome as well as translatome (mimicking the proteome component) of Pok and IR29 under salt stress. The transcriptome and translatome profiles revealed distinct differences between Pok and IR29 without salt stress (basal expression). Importantly, under salt stress, Pok seemed to stabilize mRNAs of the stress-adaptive genes and also efficiently load mRNAs onto the polysomes for translation. The overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms for DEGs of Pok compared to IR29 include maintaining cell wall integrity and photosynthesis, translocating molecules, and detoxifying ROS under salt stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A comprehensive view of the sequenced transcriptomes and translatomes</title><p id="Par15">Comparative transcriptome (mRNA) and translatome (RNA associated with polysomes [PS-mRNA]) profiles in salt-tolerant Pok and salt-sensitive IR29 genotypes should elucidate transcriptional and translational differences between these contrasting genotypes. To profile gene expression changes, 24-day-old Pok and IR29 seedlings grown on Yoshida medium were exposed to 150&#x02009;mM NaCl for 24&#x02009;h or continued to grow on Yoshida medium as a control. Total mRNA and mRNA associated with the polysomes were isolated from the control and salt-treated seedlings and used for constructing RNA-Seq libraries. We generated eight RNA-Seq libraries, four libraries each for Pok and IR29 (mRNA and mRNA-associated with the polysomes from control and salt-treated samples for each genotype) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Upon sequencing these libraries by using the single-end Illumina platform, 937,066,680 reads of 50- to 51-nt long were obtained. The sequencing depth ranged from 67 to 170 million reads for each library. The raw sequences were inspected, and low-quality reads were discarded. The remaining 731,604,828 reads (78% of total raw reads) that ranged from 58 to 121 million reads for each library (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were mapped to the rice genome (<italic>Oryza sativa subsp. japonica;</italic> MSU genome and transcriptome annotations &#x02013; v6.1). They covered about 77% of the annotated genes of the genome. Most of the uniquely mapped reads were aligned to the exons (57%), followed by intergenic regions (33%), whereas a small fraction was mapped to splice junctions (6%) and introns (4%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Identifying significant percenetage of alternatively spliced transcripts suggests that the annotated genes may have a sizable number of alternatively spliced gene products. To quantify the differences in gene expression profiles in response to salt stress, the gene expression level was normalized by using Fragments Per Kilobase of transcripts per Million mapped reads (FPKM). We exclude the assembled transcripts of &#x0003c;&#x02009;5 FPKM in all eight libraries from further analyses and the remaining 12,622 annotated transcripts were clustered by subjecting them to <italic>K</italic>-Means Clustering by using Euclidian distance measures with Genesis v1.8.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The results revealed a distinct expression pattern between IR29 and Pok for clusters 7, 10, 14 and 15, whereas most genes had similar expression patterns for clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11 and 16. Remerkably, cluster 10 with 142 genes, had higher expression in IR29 compared to Pok, whereas cluster 14 with 62 genes, had higher expression in Pok compared to IR29 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Distinct differences in gene expression profiles of Pok and IR29 without salt stress</title><p id="Par17">Differences in gene expression profiles of the transcriptome and translatome without salt stress could offer insights into the contrasting salt tolerance characteristics of Pok and IR29. Therefore, we compared the transcriptome and translatome of plants grown under control conditions. In identifying DEGs we used the following criteria: log<sub>2</sub> fold change &#x02265;1, at least FPKM &#x02265;5 in one sample for each comparison, and false discovery rate (FDR)&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. This analyses revealed variations between the genotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Without stress, a total of 1630 unique genes showed greater expression in Pok than in IR29 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Of these, 215 genes were shared between the transcriptome and translatome, whereas 751 and 664 genes were specific to the transcriptome and translatome, respectively. On the other hand, a total of 985 genes showed greater expression under control conditions in IR29 than in Pok; 265 genes were shared between the transcriptome and translatome, and the remaining 460 and 260 genes were specific to transcriptional and translational levels, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Indeed, 36.6% of the transcriptionally abundant genes showed a higher abundances at the translational level; however, about half of the highly translated genes did not have a relatively high transcription in IR29. For Pok, 22% of transcriptionally abundant genes showed a higher expression at the translational level but intriguingly, 75.5% of the highly translated genes did not have a relatively high transcriptional regulation. These data revealed a low correlation between transcriptional and translational regulation in both the genotypes under non-stress conditions. More importantly, the transcriptional and translational gene expression profiles were distinct between the two genotypes even without salt stress.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Genes with high basal expression in IR29 and Pok under control conditions.

However, terms overrepresented in IR29 were photosynthesis, response to stress, cell wall macromolecule metabolism and organization, transport, and aminoglycan metabolism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Thus, IR29 and Pok genes differed in certain biological functions when they were not subjected to salt stress.

Some of these genes belong to the same gene families, and therefore have been grouped into three clusters. The first cluster consisted of three members of the cupin domain-containing protein (CDP) family (Os03g48760, Os03g48770 and Os03g48780), the second cluster included three dehydrin genes (Os11g26570, Os11g26580 and Os11g26590) and the third cluster had five different transcripts of the late embryogenesis abundant protein family (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

The analysis has identified 20 DEGs that displayed an opposite regulation pattern in the two genotypes. Eight genes induced in IR29 at the transcriptional and/or translational level were downregulated in Pok. By contrast, three genes downregulated in IR29 at the translational level were upregulated at the transcriptional or translational level in Pok (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similarly, nine of 10 genes downregulated in IR29 at the transcriptional level were upregulated at the translational level in Pok. For instance, two nicotianamine synthase (NAS) genes were repressed at the transcriptional level but upregulated at the translational level in Pok during salt stress. In plants, NAS can catalyze and synthesize niacinamide (NA), which participates in iron ion transportation, distribution and storage, as well as transportation of other heavy metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Such genes were represented by 215 and 265 in Pok and IR29, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Of the 215 high basal expressed genes in Pok, only six were altered at the translational level in Pok; two were upregulated (iron/ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase-Os06g08041.1, and expressed protein-Os12g13910.1) and four were downregulated (RAN GTPase-activating protein 1-Os05g46560.1, LTPL122-Os04g46830.2, nucleoside-triphosphatases -Os11g25260.1 and Os11g25330.1). Similarly, of the 265 genes with high expression in IR29 under control conditions, 30 were regulated at the translational level in response to salt stress; five genes were upregulated (a proteinase inhibitor II family protein, three SCP-like extracellular proteins and one wound-induced protein) and 25 were downregulated; 17 of these were significantly downregulated at the transcriptional level. Most of these downregulated genes were stress-associated or cell wall-associated genes such as the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Os07g46990), peroxidase, glycine-rich cell wall protein, LTP protein and plastocyanin-like protein (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S6). Surprisingly, of the 265 high basal expression genes in IR29, 63 were significantly upregulated in Pok at the translational level (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S7). A notable example is thionin proteins, which are small cysteine-rich peptides potentially involved in plant pathogen responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Approximately 10 thionin or thionin-like peptides were highly expressed in IR29 under non-stress conditions and their expression was unaltered or slightly suppressed upon salt stress in IR29. In contrast, these thionin genes were significantly upregulated in Pok at the translational level, which suggests that they may have a role in salt tolerance. Contrastingly, only two genes with high basal expression in Pok were induced by salt stress at the translation level in IR29: one was heat shock protein DnaJ (Os01g42190.1), and the other was an expressed protein (Os04g06520.1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title><bold>Translational</bold> differences between IR29 and Pok under salt stress</title><p id="Par26">The mRNAs associated with polysomes represent the translation step of protein synthesis and are therefore a good predictor of protein abundance.

To assess the differences in the GO enrichment of the translatome in Pok and IR29, batch SEA analysis with agriGO was used. This analysis showed a sharp difference in GO terms between the genotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The GO terms such as the carbohydrate metabolic process, glycolysis, protein tyrosine kinase activity, regulation of biosynthetic process and hydrolase activity were enriched in IR29, whereas response to stress, transporter activity, apoplast, extracellular region and response to water were enriched in Pok (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). To further envision the pathways affected by salt stress in IR29 and Pok, we visualized the functional classification of DEGs at the translational level by using MapMan.

Consistently, we found the genes associated with photosynthesis were less severely affected in Pok than in IR29 during salt stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). For example, chlorophyll A-B binding proteins (Os11g13890, Os01g52240.1), ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain (Os12g17600) and plastocyanin-like domain containing proteins (Os07g01440, Os07g35860, Os04g53710) were significantly downregulated in IR29 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). Similarly, the genes associated with tetrapyrroles synthesis, light reaction, and Calvin cycle were more repressed in IR29 compared to Pok. FtsH-like chloroplast proteins associated with the attenuation of adverse impacts of Na<sup>+</sup> on the photosynthetic electron transport chain were accumulated in maize under salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Consistently, this protein (Os02g43350 and Os05g38400) was specifically upregulated in Pok. Another worth pointing gene that is exclusively induced in Pok was transketolase (Os04g19740), which transfers a residue with two carbon atoms from fructose-6-phosphate to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, thereby producing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP); this process is important for RuBP regeneration and photosynthesis. The exclusive induction of transketolase at the protein level was consistent with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The expression of pectin, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, cellulose and hemicellulose was severely repressed by salt stress in IR29 at the translational level, whereas translation of these genes in Pok was less affected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).

ROS in the form of O<sub>2</sub><sup>_</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and *OH can damage almost all macromolecules of the cell and can lead to cell death. To decrease the intensity of oxidative stress, plant cells increase both enzymatic (catalase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione-S-transferase) and non-enzymatic antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol, B-carotene, glutathione, and ascorbate) systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The downregulation of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Os07g46990) and peroxidases observed in IR29 at the translational level indicates that IR29 has decreased ability to reduce oxidative stress (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S6), which is consistent with the finding in IR64, another salt-sensitive rice genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the present study, four glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes (Os06g12290, Os10g38340, Os01g49720, Os10g38360) were commonly upregulated in both IR29 and Pok at the translational level. This finding is consistent with a previous study reporting similar responses in rice exposed to salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Additionally, six GSTs (Os01g25100, Os01g49710, Os01g72160, Os01g72150, Os01g72170 and Os10g38350) were exclusively upregulated in Pok (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). Plant GSTs are known to detoxify xenobiotics and hydroperoxides and function in abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Overexpression of rice GST genes in Arabidopsis confers tolerance to salt and other abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Upregulation of a greater number of GST genes at the translational level could aid Pok in decreasing oxidative stress levels. Furthermore, metallothioneins (Os03g17870 and Os12g38010), also known for their ROS scavenging activity, were specifically upregulated in the translatome of Pok. Indeed, overexpression of the metallothionein OsMT1-eP has been shown to enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses including salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Another key enzyme specifically induced in Pok at the translational level was iron/ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase (Os06g07941, Os06g08041).

In the present study, more than 7000 alternate splicing events were detected within the assembled transcripts of IR29 and Pok. At least eight alternatively spliced transcripts (two beta-expansin precursor isoforms, a dehydrin, a wound-induced protein precursor, and a photosynthesis related photosystem II polypeptide) were regulated by salt stress (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Table S12). Dehydrin is an important stress-associated gene family, and a dehydrin isoform (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Figure S3A) (TCONS_00081900, Os11g26790.1) was upregulated in IR29 and Pok at both transcriptional and translational levels. Interestingly, the induction level was comparable between IR29 and Pok at the transcriptional level but was 13-fold greater at the translational level in Pok compared to IR29. Beta-expansins are important in mediating growth, and their abundance has been found to differ between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes of maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In the present study, two isoforms of beta-expansin precursor (Os09g29710) were upregulated at the transcriptional and translational levels in response to salt stress in IR29, however, no significant induction was detected in Pok (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Table S12).

The identification of genes that are regulated in response to salt stress would provide a better understanding of the molecular processes and useful for improving the salt tolerance of rice via molecular breeding and/or transgenic strategies. Although many salt stress-responsive genes have been identified by transcriptome analysis in Pok and IR29, however, whether all of these transcriptionally regulated genes translate into proteins or not is unkown in these contrasting rice genotypes. The proteins are direct effectors of plant stress responses. Proteins include enzymes and also components of transcription and translation; they regulate plant stress responses at both mRNA and protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes at the transcription level do not often correspond to changes at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Polyribosomal loading of transcripts is the most important step in the translation initiation process. By examining transcriptome and translatome, the qualitative and quantitative differences in the transcriptional and translational profiles of Pok and IR29 even without salt stress was noted in this study. Furthermore, upon salt stress, translational regulation sharply differed between the Pok and IR29; Pok showed the highest number of upregulated genes, and a far less number of downregulated genes than that for IR29 at the translational level. These findings suggest a potential yet unknown mechanism contributing to the stability and efficient loading of the mRNAs in Pok; this distinct regulation was less evident in IR29.</p><p id="Par40">The present study also has identified a set of shared genes that are responding to salt stress regardless of genotype and also identified a number of genes that are not known to differ in their regulation during stress treatment. For instance, protein disulfide isomerase, NAS genes, thionins, and several uncharacterized proteins could be added to the category of stress responsive genes in plants. This study also identified many novel transcripts and alternative splice variants that respond to salt stress.</p><p id="Par41">Overall, sequencing of polysome-associated RNA offered major differences in gene regulation operating at the translational level between IR29 and Pok. These findings suggest that the salt tolerance of Pok could be attributed to its upregulation of genes, especially at the translational level, associated with cell wall synthesis, ROS scavenging, translocating molecules, and TFs, and better maintenance of photosynthesis-related genes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Plant materials and salt stress treatment</title><p id="Par42">Rice genotypes IR29 and Pok seeds were germinated between moist paper towels and the germinated seedlings were transferred to 96-well PCR plates with the bottom cut off and placed to float on Yoshida medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].

The purple line represents the mean expression level of the genes in the same cluster; grey lines represent the expression of each gene in the cluster. Transcripts were divided into 16 clusters (cluster 1 to 16) based on their expression level by using k-Means Clustering (KMC). The vertical axis represents the gene expression value (log2 FPKM), and the horizontal axis represents the 8 samples (in order from left to right: IR29c_RNA, IR29s_RNA, Pokc_RNA, Poks_RNA, IR29c_PS, IR29s_PS, Pokc_PS and Poks_PS).Most genes in clusters 1, 2, 3, 6 and 16 had similar expression in IR29 and Pok but were not responsive by salt stress. Cluster 5 represents genes that were moderately upregulated by salt stress, cluster 9 represents genes that were strongly upregulated by salt stress in both IR29 and Pok at the transcriptional and translational levels, and cluster 13 represents genes were repressed by salt stress in IR29 and Pok at both transcriptional and translational levels. Cluster 10 represents genes with higher abundances at both transcriptional and translational levels in IR29 but extremely low abundance in Pok, whereas cluster 14 represents genes with very low expression at both transcriptional and translational levels in IR29 under both control and salt stress conditions but higher transcriptional and translational levels in Pok; these genes did not respond to salt stress. Cluster 7 represents genes that did not respond to salt stress at the transcriptional level in Pok but were highly upregulated at the translational level. Clusters 8 and 15 represent genes highly upregulated by salt stress in IR29 at the transcriptional and translational levels but only upregulated in Pok at the translational level. Cluster 11 represents genes with relatively higher expression in Pok than in IR29 at the transcriptional level. Cluster 12 represents genes with lower translation than transcription.
