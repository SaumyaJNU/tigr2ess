    "Multiple rice body formation is a rare presentation of chronic sub-acromial bursitis secondary to extensive underlying rheumatoid arthritis, sero-negative inflammatory arthritis or tuberculous joints. Although there is usually an accompanying inflammatory arthropathy, it can occur in the absence of any underlying systemic disorder. We report a case of five years old neglected rice body deposition in shoulder in a 54-years old lady diagnosed to be having rheumatoid arthritis. After initial investigations, arthroscopic removal of rice bodies with bursa excision relieved the symptoms. The underlying rheumatic condition continued its course, generally sparing the involved shoulder joint. We suggest thorough examination for systemic rheumatologic disease in patients diagnosed with such lesions."
