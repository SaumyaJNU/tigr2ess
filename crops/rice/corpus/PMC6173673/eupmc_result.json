    "BACKGROUND:Host-plant resistance is the most desirable and economic way to overcome BPH damage to rice. As single-gene resistance is easily lost due to the evolution of new BPH biotypes, it is urgent to explore and identify new BPH resistance genes. RESULTS:In this study, using F2:3 populations and near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived from crosses between two BPH-resistant Sri Lankan rice cultivars (KOLAYAL and POLIYAL) and a BPH-susceptible cultivar 9311, a new resistance gene Bph33 was fine mapped to a 60-kb region ranging 0.91-0.97 Mb on the short arm of chromosome 4 (4S), which was at least 4 Mb distant from those genes/QTLs (Bph12, Bph15, Bph3, Bph20, QBph4 and QBph4.2) reported before. Seven genes were predicted in this region. Based on sequence and expression analyses, a Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) family gene (LOC_Os04g02520) was identified as the most possible candidate of Bph33. The gene exhibited continuous and stable resistance from seedling stage to tillering stage, showing both antixenosis and antibiosis effects on BPH. CONCLUSION:The results of this study will facilitate map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection of the gene."
