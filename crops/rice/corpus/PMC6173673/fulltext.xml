Presently, spraying insecticides (e.g. imidacloprid) is the chief way to control BPH, which is costly and hazardous to health and environment. In addition, it often makes BPH develop resistance to insecticides and therefore leads to resurrection of BPH population (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>). Hence, using rice resistance to BPH should be the most economic and effective approach for the management of BPH (Jena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Rice resistance to BPH has been studied in the last half century.

To identify the possible candidate gene(s), using the BSA-seq data, we compared the allele sequences of these genes from the resistant parents KOLAYAL and POLIYAL with those from the susceptible parent 9311 and Nipponbare (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S3).

The possibility for the last one to be <italic>Bph33</italic> could not be eliminated, but it should be very small compared with those of LOC_Os04g02510 and LOC_Os04g02520.

The results (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1) indicated that at the time of 0&#x000a0;h (before infestation), five genes, LOC_Os04g02510, LOC_Os04g02520, LOC_Os04g02530, LOC_Os04g02550 and LOC_Os04g02570 showed significantly lower expression level in NIL (+) than those of NIL (&#x02212;). At the time of 6&#x000a0;h and 48&#x000a0;h (after infestation), four and two genes had lower expression level in NIL (+) that those of NIL (&#x02212;). However, the expression levels of none of the genes in NIL (+) were significantly up-regulated and significantly higher than those in NIL (&#x02212;) almost at both of time points after BPH infestation.

In addition, both genes had a lower expression level in NIL (+) than in NIL(&#x02212;), but the difference was much greater for LOC_Os04g02510. Considering that resistant was dominant to susceptible as mentioned above, these results suggested that LOC_Os04g02510 should be less likely to be <italic>Bph33</italic>. So, we took LOC_Os04g02520 as the most possible candidate of <italic>Bph33</italic>. There were six SNPs and two InDels in the second and the third exons of LOC_Os04g02520 between the two resistant and the two susceptible varieties, causing six amino acid substitutions and one and two amino acid insertions in POLIYAL and KOLAYAL, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

Six genes/QTLs (<italic>Bph12</italic>, <italic>Bph3</italic>, <italic>Bph15</italic>, <italic>Bph20, QBph4 and QBph4.2</italic>) are located in the region 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;Mb on chromosome 4S (Qiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2012</xref>; Lv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>; Rahman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">b</xref>).

Recently, a new major QTL, <italic>Qbph4.3</italic>, was mapped between markers RM551 (0.177&#x000a0;Mb) and RM335 (0.688&#x000a0;Mb) on chromosome 4S (Mohanty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). The position of <italic>Bph33</italic> was outside this interval (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Bph33</italic> should be different from <italic>Qbph4.3</italic>. There is another QTL, <italic>Qbph4.4</italic>, claimed beside <italic>Qbph4.3</italic>, of which the interval covers <italic>Bph33</italic> (Mohanty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). However, <italic>Qbph4.4</italic> is a minor QTL with small effect and its interval is very large, ranging from 0.688&#x000a0;Mb to 13.07&#x000a0;Mb, which covers a total of seven BPH resistance genes/QTLs reported (including <italic>Bph33</italic>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This means that <italic>Qbph4.4</italic> is indeterminate. In addition, as <italic>Qbph4.4</italic> is mapped in the same population with <italic>Qbph4.3</italic>, it is likely to be a false QTL because two QTLs located in adjacent marker intervals are indistinguishable according to the statistical theory of QTL mapping (Zeng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1994</xref>). So, it is hard to say that <italic>Qbph4.4</italic> is a new QTL.

Among them, antibiosis is the major one conferred by almost all BPH resistance genes (Qiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). The results of this study indicated that <italic>Bph33</italic> also exhibited significant antibiosis and antixenosis effects, with its resistant allele acting to strengthen the antibiosis and antixenosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">It has been found that a large proportion of rice cultivars from Sri Lanka are probably resistant to different biotypes of BPH (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). Rathu Heenati, a famous Sri Lankan cultivar, is found to be resistant to all the four biotypes of BPH (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Jairin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>). In this study, the two resistant cultivars, KOLAYLA and POLIYAL, were also originated from Sri Lanka.

The two cities are far apart to each other (the straight line distance between them is ~&#x02009;900&#x000a0;km) and have different climates. So, it is possible that the BPH populations from these two places are divergent in genetic structure with different constitution of biotypes or different predominant biotypes. In addition, the resistance mechanisms of <italic>Bph33</italic> discussed above and its feature of continuous resistance during plant growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) are all similar to those found in broad-spectrum BPH resistance genes such as <italic>Bph6</italic> and <italic>Bph9</italic> (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2016</xref>; Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>).
