The purpose of this study was to explore the possible roles of miR-7a-2-3p in brain injury using a hypoxia-ischemia model in rats and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model <italic>in vitro</italic>. Firstly, we established the hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model and verified the model using Zea Longa scores and MRI in rats. Next, the changes of miR-7a-2-3p were screened in the ischemic cortex of neonatal rats by qRT-PCR at 12, 48, and 96 h after HIBD. We have found that the expression of miR-7a-2-3p in the HI rats decreased significantly, compared with the sham group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Then, we established the OGD model in PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and qRT-PCR was used to confirm the changes of miR-7a-2-3p in these cells after the OGD. In order to determine the function of miR-7a-2-3p, PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary cortical neurons were randomly divided into normal, OGD, mimic negative control (mimic-NC) and miR-7a-2-3p groups. Then, Tuj1+ (neuronal marker) staining, TUNEL assay (to detect apoptotic cells) and MTT assay (to investigate cell viability) were performed. We have found that the number of PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells and cortical neurons in the miR-7a-2-3p groups increased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in comparison to the OGD groups. The survival of cortical neurons in the miR-7a-2-3p group was improved markedly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), while the apoptosis of neurons in the miR-7a-2-3p group was significantly decreased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), compared with the normal group. Lastly, we investigated the target genes of miR-7a-2-3p by using the prediction databases (miRDB, TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRmap) and verified the target genes with qRT-PCR in the HI rats. Bioinformatics prediction showed that Vimentin (VIM), pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1(PLAG1), dual specificity phosphatase 10 (DUSP10), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (TNFRSF1B) might be the targets of miR-7a-2-3p and the qRT-PCR confirmed that VIM increased in the HI rats (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). In conclusion, miR-7a-2-3p plays a crucial role in the hypoxic-ischemic injury, and is associated with regulation of VIM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD)</kwd><kwd>miR-7a-2-3p</kwd><kwd>oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)</kwd><kwd>neuronal apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Vimentin (VIM)</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Neonatal ischemic hypoxic brain damage (HIBD) is caused by intrauterine asphyxia and congenital diseases and is common in neonates of perinatal period (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fenichel, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">DelRosso et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, neonatal HIBD not only threatens the life of neonates, but also leads to series of secondary neuronal damages after perinatal period (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gieron-Korthals and Colon, 2005</xref>), which are related to remote organ dysfunctions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Klempt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Perlman, 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms of neonatal HIBD are not entirely clear and the effective treatment strategy is not identified, therefore it is important to explore the molecular mechanisms of HIBD.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs, approximately 20&#x02013;22 nucleotides in length, which are involved in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shi, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bartel, 2004</xref>). MiRNAs can bind to the 3&#x02019;untranslated region (3&#x02019;UTR) of a target gene, resulting in the target mRNA degradation or translational repression (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bagga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Nohata et al., 2011</xref>), which are involved in diverse biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and death (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ambros, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fasanaro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2014</xref>). In the recent years, researchers have found that miRNAs are related to nerve repair and regeneration closely (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that mature miR-7 is regulated by the transcription factor HoxD10 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, researchers have found that miR-7 is highly connected to cancerous cell proliferation and metastasis, visual abnormalities, myocardial fibrosis and neuropathic pain (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sakai et al., 2013</xref>). However, the role of miR-7a-2-3p in hypoxic-ischemic brain damage is unclear. Therefore, it is important to explore the molecular effects of miR-7a-2-3p in HIBD.</p><p>Thus, our study aimed to investigate the possible effects of miR-7a-2-3p on the hypoxic ischemic neurons in the neonatal HIBD. Investigation of these mechanisms could provide a novel treatment strategy for neonatal HIBD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals Care and Grouping</title><p>Neonatal rats (seven-day old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats) were provided by Experimental Animal Center of Kunming Medical University (China).

In addition, this study indicated that VIM might be the action target gene of miR-7a-2-3p. The present study suggested that miR-7a-2-3p might play a crucial role in neonatal HIBD and VIM might be its direct target gene, thus providing a guide for future fundamental research and possible clinical therapeutic strategy.</p><p>In this study, we established the HI model <italic>in vivo</italic> and OGD model <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that the levels of miR-7a-2-3p are significantly decreased in hypoxic-ischemic damage. The HI model was examined by Zea Longa scores (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chandra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Legos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lenhard et al., 2008</xref>) which were used to verify the degree of neurologic deficits (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Maguire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Ashwal et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The cerebrum infarction was evident according to MRI at 1 month in the HI rats, also confirming that HI model was successfully established. Then, we obtained the cortical tissues of rats at 12, 48, and 96 h after HI to investigate the expression of miR-7a-2-3p by qRT-PCR, which showed that the levels of miR-7a-2-3p were significantly decreased after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. In the previous study, researchers have found that miR-124-3p, the most brain-enriched miRNA, was significantly reduced after cerebral ischemia and hypoxia in stroke. They have also found that miR-124-3p was SVZ neuronal fate determinant and mediated stroke-induced neurogenesis in adult SVZ and striatum (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Akerblom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Doeppner et al., 2013</xref>). Other researchers have found that miR-207 and miR-352 were mainly down-regulated in rats after the middle cerebral artery occlusion, and played a role in regulating neuronal apoptosis. Hereby, we hypothesized that miR-7a-2-3p might play a significant role in neonatal HIBD.</p><p>In present study, we have found that overexpression of miR-7a-2-3p promoted neuronal survival and reduced neuronal apoptosis after OGD, which suggested that it might be the key regulated target site in ischemic injury. Previous studies have shown that miR-7 could suppress secretion of insulin, indicating that it might become a new target for improving &#x003b2; cell function in diabetes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Other researchers have also reported that miR-7a-2-3p was responsible for protecting cardiac myocytes against hypoxia-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). It also could significantly influence self-renewal ability of Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by targeting Klf4 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Further study proved that miR-7 targeted Herpud2 3&#x02019;UTR, which encoded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein-HERP2. MiR-7 depressed the ER-related protein expression including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), and thereby attenuated the OGD-mediated inflammatory response and astrocytic damage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). In other studies, hypoxia has been validated to modulate miRNAs&#x02019; expression (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Nallamshetty et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings demonstrated that miR-7a-2-3p could suppress neuron apoptosis and promoted neuron survival after OGD injury. Furthermore, we predicted the target gene of miR-7a-2-3p. Our findings showed that VIM contained a certain conserved sequence complementary with miR-7a-2-3p, indicating that it might play a key role in the neuroprotection. The expression of miR-7a-2-3p and VIM demonstrated a negative correlation between miR-7a-2-3p and VIM, which indicated that VIM might be the direct target gene of miR-7a-2-3p in hypoxic-ischemic neuron injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, miR-7a-2-3p might be an important regulatory molecule of apoptosis after hypoxic-ischemic neuron damage. Moreover, as the target gene of miR-7a-2-3p, VIM might have a role in hypoxic-ischemic neuron injury. This study provides new knowledge on the pathogenesis and possible treatments of cerebral ischemia, while detailed molecular mechanisms still need to be further explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>T-HW conceived and designed the experiments.
