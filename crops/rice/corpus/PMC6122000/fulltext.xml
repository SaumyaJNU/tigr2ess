Analyses using scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that fengycin BS155 caused morphological changes in the plasma membrane and cell wall of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> hyphae. Using comparative proteomic and biochemical assays, fengycin BS155 was demonstrated to reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), induce bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and downregulate the expression level of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Simultaneously, fengycin BS155 caused chromatin condensation in fungal hyphal cells, which led to the upregulation of DNA repair-related protein expression and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

In particular, rice blast disease caused by <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> is extremely difficult to control, and outbreaks of this disease could lead to significant economic and humanitarian problems (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). While chemical control agents are still vital for the effective control of fungal plant pathogens and rice blast, the excessive use of chemicals increases the potential for the buildup of resistance in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>, generating pathogen strains that are harder to control (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, with the public concern over the hazardous effects of chemicals, it is very important to find and develop suitable alternatives for plant disease control (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Biological control agents (BCAs), including microorganisms, microbial products, and biofertilizers, have been developed as promising and ecofriendly alternatives to chemical pesticides (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Over the past few decades, hundreds of peptide antibiotics have been described, and antimicrobial peptides sourced from microorganisms are considered promising drug candidates for the future because of their broad range of activity, reduced toxicity, the potential for environmentally friendly mass production, and the decreased resistance development associated with their use (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus</named-content> species synthesize a range of cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These CLPs, consisting of a fatty acyl chain bound to a cyclic peptide ring, are produced by multidomain enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). CLPs from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus</named-content> species can be divided into three main subfamilies, surfactins, iturins, and fengycins or plipastatins. Among these CLPs, fengycins exhibit powerful antifungal activity against a wide range of phytopathogens (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Fengycin homologues effectively inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi, such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhizopus stolonifer</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Gibberella zeae</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus niger</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mucor rouxii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Fusarium graminearum</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</named-content> (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Fengycin and the closely related plipastatin CLPs are composed of an N-terminal &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acid chain attached to a decapeptide forming a cyclic lactone ring. The major members of the fengycin subfamily are fengycin A and fengycin B, which differ structurally only by the residue at position 6 being Ala or Val, respectively (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Further heterogeneity among the fengycins is introduced by the variable length of the &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acid chains (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Much work has been carried out to understand the molecular mechanisms of the biological activity of fengycins (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Due to their amphiphilic nature, fengycins are believed to induce cell death by interacting with the cell membrane and increasing cell permeability (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Fengycins were shown to cause ultrastructural destruction of the fungal pathogen hyphae; fengycin-treated hyphae exhibited unconsolidated cytoplasm and cell walls that were gapped and/or separated from the cell membrane (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can oxidize lipids, proteins, DNA, and carbohydrates within biological organisms, leading to the breakdown of the cellular membrane or cell death (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Recent research showed that CLPs, including bacillomycin D, iturins, and fengycins, were involved in an antagonistic interaction with the plant fungal pathogens by inducing ROS production (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Additionally, certain CLPs specifically affect the signaling pathways of fungal or cancer cells. For example, bacillomycin D and iturins induce Hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and subsequent defects in the cell wall integrity (CWI) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Surfactins were able to cause cell death of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through the ROS/c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated mitochondrial/caspase pathway (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Another study revealed that surfactins induce a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), initiating the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria and the activation of caspase 9, in MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, there are only few examples of investigations of the signaling pathways and intracellular cell responses to fengycins.</p><p>Presently, microbial proteomic technologies not only provide a powerful tool to profile protein expression in response to various stresses in a microorganism but also are used to reveal the possible mechanism of action of antibiotics (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). For instance, comparative proteomic analyses revealed that bacillomycin L interacts with intracellular targets of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Rhizoctonia solani</named-content> hyphal cells and affects mitochondrial function, RNA processing and silencing, and calcium homeostasis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Until now, proteomics-based mechanism studies of the action of fengycins against phytopathogens have not been reported.</p><p>Although many fengycin CLPs produced by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus</named-content> species have antiphytopathogen activities, their exact mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In the present study, fengycin BS155 from the marine bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> BS155 was shown to possess strong fungicidal activity against <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>. In this fungus, fengycin BS155 induced ROS production and chromatin condensation and, ultimately, caused cell death. These findings shed new light on antifungal mechanisms of fengycins and provide a new BCA against the notorious phytopathogen <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Antifungal activity of marine bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> BS155 against <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>.</title><p>To obtain potential antifungal agents, more than 400 marine bacteria were screened and evaluated on their ability to inhibit <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> growth by using an antagonistic experiment.

The diameter of the hyphal colony of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> treated with BS155 crude extract (40 &#x003bc;g/ml) was only 2.25 cm, much smaller than that of the control untreated colony (6.65 cm) (Fig. S1B and C). According to the high homology (99% identity) with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> strain 168, confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis (see Fig. S2), the bacterium strain BS155 was designated <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content> BS155.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Purification, structure elucidation, and encoding gene determination of CLPs derived from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> BS155.</title><p>To obtain the active compound(s) from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> BS155 responsible for <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> growth inhibition, purification was performed as described in Materials and Methods. The filter paper disc assay was carried out to follow the trail of the bioactive compound(s) using <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> as the indicator fungus. Notably, a single peak associated with strong antifungal activity was observed in the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) chromatogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicating that there was only one or a few closely related compounds responsible for the action of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> BS155. In the filter paper disc assay, the compounds collected from RP-HPLC showed strongly antifungal activity against <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and were further analyzed with a mass spectrometer to elucidate the chemical structure. The data of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) showed that the ions corresponding to the active compound(s) were [M + Na]<sup>+</sup> (<italic>m/z</italic> 1,527.8134) and [M + H]<sup>+</sup> (<italic>m/z</italic> 1,505.8307) (see Fig. S3A). Thus, the molecular weight of the purified active compound(s) was determined to be 1,504 Da. Notably, these results corresponded to the MS data obtained from fengycin CLPs in previous reports (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The profile of the typical fragmentation ions of <italic>m/z</italic> 966 and 1,080 in the ESI-MS/MS spectrum can be explained by neutral losses of fatty acid-Glu and fatty acid-Glu-Orn, respectively, from the N-terminal segment with an Ala residue at position 6 in C<sub>19</sub>-fengycin A cyclic decapeptide. In addition, the neutral losses of fatty acid-Glu and fatty acid-Glu-Orn from the N-terminal segment with a Val residue at position 6 in C<sub>17</sub>-fengycin B cyclic decapeptide were attributed to the fragmentation ions <italic>m/z</italic> 994 and 1,108, respectively (Fig. S3B) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). C<sub>19</sub>-fengycin A and C<sub>17</sub>-fengycin B had &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acids with chain lengths of 19 and 17 carbon atoms, respectively, leading to a mass difference of 28 Da. However, Ala (71 Da) and Val (99 Da) residues appeared at position 6 of the cyclic decapeptides in C<sub>19</sub>-fengycin A and C<sub>17</sub>-fengycin B, respectively, which counteracted the 28-Da mass difference resulting from different &#x003b2;-hydroxy fatty acid chain lengths. The pairs of typical fragments (<italic>m/z</italic> 966 and 1,080 and <italic>m/z</italic> 994 and 1,108) were present simultaneously and led us to conclude that both C<sub>19</sub>-fengycin A and C<sub>17</sub>-fengycin B contributed to the production of the ion of <italic>m/z</italic> 1,505.8307 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Overall, the data of the ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS spectra are consistent with fengycin compounds, specifically with C<sub>19</sub>-fengycin A and C<sub>17</sub>-fengycin B CLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).

Furthermore, an analysis of the distribution and subcellular location of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that the proteins of the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and cytoskeleton undergo a significant change in abundance upon treatment with fengycin BS155 (Fig. S5C and D), implying that these hyphal subcellular structures were impacted by the CLPs.

As unavoidable byproducts of aerobic metabolism, ROS play important physiological roles, whereas an excess of these species has the capacity to damage cell components and induce cell death (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).

While ROS at a low concentration are an important intracellular messenger in many molecular events, large amounts of ROS are associated with cell death (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In recent studies, CLPs such as iturin, fengycins, and bacillomycin D were found to cause fungal cell death by inducing ROS accumulation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In this work, six types of ROS-scavenging enzymes whose expression levels were apparently downregulated after treatment with fengycin BS155 were identified by the proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, the activities of two typical ROS-scavenging enzymes, SOD and CAT, were dramatically reduced after the treatment with fengycin BS155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). Additionally, the downregulation of expressions and activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes weakened the ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> to neutralize ROS, which promoted the accumulation of these species. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that damage to the ROS-scavenging proteins prevents the removal of a normal amount of ROS, which needs to be verified by Western blot analyses in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, an excessive oxidative stress burden may trigger an MMP collapse, which in turn leads to the increase of ROS generation (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Consistently, fengycin BS155 apparently induced a collapse of the MMP in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> hyphal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), which might lead to the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins into the cytoplasm, triggering cellular fragmentation and DNA damage and eventually causing cell apoptosis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Collectively, the induction of ROS bursts by fengycin BS155 is suggested to contribute to cell death in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content>; ROS accumulation was correlated with the downregulation of ROS-scavenging enzymes and MMP collapse.</p><p>Notably, we observed that chromatin condensation was induced by fengycin BS155 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> hyphal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, chromatin condensation can activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and is an integral part of the associated signaling pathway (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). The DDR occurs in the context of chromatin structure changes, whereby architectural features of chromatin contribute to DNA damage signaling and repair (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Indeed, the expression of proteins implicated in DNA synthesis and repair was dramatically upregulated, according to our proteomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>), while the expression of proteins essential for DNA stability was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). The transcription levels of genes encoding condensin complex subunit 1 and condensin complex component cnd2 were both significantly elevated in fengycin BS155-treated <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> hyphal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the cleavage of PARP, an important DNA repair enzyme, is regarded as the primary representative biomorphic clue for apoptosis (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). PARP can be cleaved from a full-length protein with molecular weight of 116 kDa to an 85-kDa fragment by caspase 3 during animal cell death (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus nidulans</named-content>, an 81-kDa or modified 85-kDa PARP protein [e.g., glycosylated or oligo(ADP-ribosylated)] can be cleaved to a 60-kDa fragment by caspase-like protein during sporulation (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In this study, the 68-kDa full-length PARP was cleaved to a 55-kDa truncated protein when treated with fengycin BS155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>), and the cleavage rate was dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Overall, fengycin BS155 CLPs can induce chromatin condensation which thereafter activates the DDR; the DDR, in turn, triggers multiple cellular events, including the activation of DNA repair pathways, arrest of the cell cycle to allow time for repair, and, in certain cases, the initiation of senescence or apoptosis programs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, the comparative proteomic and biochemical analyses of this study suggest that fengycins can induce high ROS accumulation and a collapse of the MMP and affect <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> DNA repair signaling pathways, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref>). Our study also highlights the potential of marine-derived bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content> BS155 as a BCA against <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> in rice cultivation under both fresh- and saltwater conditions.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 9</label><caption><p>The proposed model of fengycin BS155 action in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. grisea</named-content> hyphal cells. Fengycin BS155 interacts with the fungal hyphal cell membrane and enters the intracellular space (step 1). Fengycin BS155 damages the plasma membranes and then induces dysfunction of organelles and a burst of ROS (step 2). Fengycin BS155 reduces the MMP and downregulates the activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes (such as CAT and SOD), which in turn facilitates the production of additional ROS (step 3). Fengycin BS155 also induces DNA condensation, leading to the upregulation of DNA repair protein expression (step 4). Fengycin BS155 causes PARP cleavage (step 5), which is an important representative clue for hyphal cell apoptosis. Altogether, the organelle dysfunction, accumulation of ROS, and chromatin condensation induced by fengycin BS155 finally lead to cell death.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zam0181887180009"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Microorganisms and culture conditions.</title><p>The marine bacterium BS155 used in this study was isolated from sediments collected near the Yap Trench during the seamount cruise of the R/V <named-content content-type="genus-species">Kexue</named-content> in the tropical Western Pacific in March 2016 (139&#x000b0;3802&#x02032;E, 11&#x000b0;44162&#x02032;N).
