However, limited information is available on the genetic control of meiotic cytokinesis in plants. Here, we identified a rice mutant with low male fertility, <italic>defective callose in meiosis 1</italic> (<italic>dcm1</italic>). The pollen grains of <italic>dcm1</italic> are proved to be defective in exine formation. Meiotic cytokinesis is disrupted in <italic>dcm1</italic>, resulting in disordered spindle orientation during meiosis II and formation of pollen grains with varied size and DNA content. We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in <italic>dcm1</italic> is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates. Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the <italic>dcm1</italic> pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene. The DCM1 protein contains five tandem CCCH motifs and interacts with nuclear poly (A) binding proteins (PABNs) in nuclear speckles. The expression profiles of genes related to callose synthesis and degradation are significantly modified in <italic>dcm1</italic>. Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Meiosis comprises two successive cell divisions after a single S phase, generating four haploid products. Meiotic caryokinesis (nuclear division) has been extensively studied in many organisms, while mechanisms underlying meiotic cytokinesis remain elusive. Here, we identified a novel CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein DCM1 that prevent the premature dissolution of callose both around the PMCs and at the dividing site (callosic plates). Loss of the callosic plates disrupts the meiotic cytokinesis, leading to the random distribution of spindles during meiosis II and aberrant meiotic products. DCM1 interacts with the two rice poly (A) binding proteins, independently of the conserved CCCH domain. Moreover, DCM1 coordinates the expression profiles of genes related to callose synthesis and degradation. We suspect monocots and dicots may adopt distinct meiotic cytokinesis patterns during male gamete generation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0100901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8428-8010</contrib-id><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Zhukuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8428-8010</contrib-id><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Zhukuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0100901), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31771363).

In animal and yeast dividing cells, an actomyosin ring contracts centripetally to separate the daughter cells [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In higher plants, however, cytokinesis involves the formation of a cell plate through the fusion of vesicles at its centrifugally expanding periphery [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division consisting of one round of DNA replication and two rounds of nuclear division [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In plant male meiosis, two different types of cell plate formation, namely successive and simultaneous cytokinesis, are documented. Each caryokinesis is directly followed by a cytokinetic event in successive cytokinesis (typically in monocots), while the simultaneous cytokinesis occurs only when both nuclear division are finalized (typically in dicots) [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Callose, a &#x003b2;-1, 3-glucan polymer with &#x003b2;-1, 6-branches, plays important roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as in a variety of developmental processes, especially in cell plate formation and reproductive development in plants [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During mitosis, callose is deposited at the cell plate during the tubular network stage and is later replaced by cellulose [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mutation of <italic>MASSUE/AtGSL8 </italic>in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which encodes a putative callose synthase, leads to seedling lethality and a striking cytokinesis-defective phenotype [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>enlarged tetrad 2</italic>, which harbors a splice site mutation of <italic>AtGSL8</italic>, undergoes premeiotic endomitosis due to cytokinetic defects in flowers [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings indicate that callose is required for plant mitotic cytokinesis.</p><p>For pollen mother cells (PMCs), callose is placed both at the division site as well as at the outer cell wall. The peripheral callose may prevent PMCs fusion and cohesion, and appear to participate in the formation of the primexine by providing a mold for pollen exine construction during microsporogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Callose synthase 5 (CalS5), also known as glucan synthase-like 2 (AtGSL2), is responsible for the synthesis of callose deposited at the primary cell wall of PMCs, tetrads and microspores, and is essential for exine formation of pollen wall in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Mutation of <italic>OsGSL5</italic>, the rice homolog of <italic>AtGSL2</italic>, also results in defective callose deposition and abnormal pollen exine structure formation [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>AtGSL1</italic> and <italic>AtGSL5</italic>, two closely related genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, are required for synthesis of the interstitial callose that normally separates microspores. The enlarged pollen grains and multi-nucleate microspores in <italic>gsl1-1</italic>/+ <italic>gsl5-2</italic>/<italic>gsl5-3</italic> suggest that callose is required for meiotic cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis mpk4</italic>, which has a male-specific meiotic cytokinesis defect, PMCs fail to form normal intersporal callose walls after meiosis, and thus cannot complete meiotic cytokinesis [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, TETRASPORE/STUD, a kinesin required for male meiotic cytokinesis in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], was reported to function upstream of MPK4 in a putative cascade pathway.</p><p>CCCH zinc finger proteins are characterized by a zinc finger motif consisting of three cysteines and one histidine coordinated by a zinc cation and have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and other plant species [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed that CCCH proteins participate in the regulation of many developmental processes and environmental responses [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the molecular functions have not been fully characterized, multiple lines of evidence suggest that proteins with CCCH motifs can regulate gene expression through modulation of RNA metabolism. For example, OsTZF1 binds to U-rich sequences in the 3&#x02019;UTR of two potential target mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and AtTZF1 can trigger the degradation of AU-rich elements (ARE)-containing mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Here, we report a novel protein, DCM1 (Defective Callose in Meiosis 1), is required for meiotic cytokinesis in rice. The meiotic cytokinesis defect is caused by the premature dissolution of callosic plates during both telophase I and telophase II. DCM1 interacts with two nuclear poly (A) binding proteins, which are members of the polyadenylation factor family, independently of the conserved tandem CCCH domain. Our study provides insight into the mechanism underlying meiotic cytokinesis in monocots.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of a mutant with dramatically reduced fertility</title><p>We isolated the <italic>defective callose in meiosis 1</italic> (<italic>dcm1</italic>) mutant in a screen of our rice mutant libraries with reduced fertility.

Without the callosic plate, meiotic cytokinesis in <italic>dcm1</italic> is not completed. The defective meiotic cytokinesis during telophase I lead to the random movement of the spindles at meiosis II and the varied arrangement of meiotic products. The aberrant meiotic products develop into pollen grains with varied sizes and DNA contents, which is reminiscent of the phenotypes of <italic>atps1</italic> and <italic>jason</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, instead of the cell plate, an organelle band is formed during meiotic telophase I. The loss of AtPS1 or JASON protein leads to the disruption of organelle band, resulting in the disrupted spindle positioning during male meiosis II [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], just like that observed in <italic>dcm1</italic>.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>The role of callose in meiotic cytokinesis in monocotyledonous plants</title><p>The deposition of callose during mitotic and meiotic cytokinesis in plants has been meticulously analyzed by electron microscopy [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is possible that the membrane network serves as a trigger for the induction of callose accumulation, since it only appears directly at the cell plate and not in the secretory vesicles <italic>en route</italic> to the division plane [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Samuels <italic>et al</italic>. (1995) postulated that callose helps to mechanically stabilize the early delicate membrane networks of forming cell plates in tobacco, and to create a rapid spreading force that widens the tubules and converts them into plate-like structures. However, Thiele <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) revealed that the cell-plate membrane compartment forms and expands, seemingly as far as the parental wall, prior to the appearance of callose. Based on characterization of the <italic>gsl8</italic> mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, they speculated that callose might be required for inserting the nascent crosswall at the division site during mitosis.</p><p>Callose is only a transient structure during somatic cytokinesis that is replaced by cellulose during the final step. However, this is not the case in successive-type meiotic cytokinesis, which is typically observed in monocots PMCs. Callosic plates are formed after both the first and the second caryokinesis events during meiosis. The callosic plate is preserved when the first cell division is completed and persists through the second cell division. Whether other polysaccharides, such as cellulose and pectin, are deposit on the cell plate during meiotic cytokinesis is still uncertain. It is possible that the callosic plate is the only physical barrier insulating the cytoplasm during meiotic cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>The possible mechanism by which DCM1 coordinates the metabolism of callose</title><p>The most prominent feature of DCM1 is the five tandem CCCH domain at its C-terminus, which is conserved between different kingdoms. The homolog of <italic>DCM1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was named <italic>SOP1</italic> (<italic>SUPPRESSOR OF PAS2 1</italic>), the mutation of which suppressed the developmental defects of a splicing-defective allele of <italic>PASTICCINO2</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Red5, the homolog of DCM1 in fission yeast, is essential for efficient elimination of specific meiotic mRNAs during vegetative growth and the proper splicing of meiotic genes [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], indicating that DCM1 might be involved in mRNA processing or elimination. OsPABN1 and OsPABN2, the two nuclear poly A binding proteins in rice, were identified as interacting partners of DCM1. In fission yeast, Red5 was co-immunoprecipitated with Pab2, the orthologue of OsPABN1 and OsPABN2 [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, dZC3H3, the homolog of DCM1 in flies, also associates with PABP2 [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recently, the direct interaction between Red5 and Pab2 was detected in a proteome-wide interactome study [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, the interactions between proteins containing five tandem CCCH domain and nuclear poly (A) binding proteins might be conserved in fungi, animals and plants.</p><p>Studies of DCM1 homologs in the other species mentioned above indicate that they are involved in nuclear exosome functions, and RNA degradation by the exosome is the main pathway for the removal of unwanted RNA in all kingdoms [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, studies in fission yeast have demonstrated that Pab2 and the nuclear exosome subunit, Rrp6, are the main factors involved in a polyadenylation-dependent pre-mRNA degradation pathway, and inefficient splicing is important to dictate susceptibility to this process [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The retained <italic>PAS2</italic> transcript in <italic>sop1</italic> harbors a nucleotide substitution before a GC splicing site that mimics a pre-mRNA with low splicing efficiency [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], indicating that the tandem CCCH zinc finger protein and the poly (A) binding protein could be involved in conserved biological processes across species.</p><p>During meiosis, callose metabolism must be precisely controlled to ensure the completion of meiotic cytokinesis by its deposition and release of microspores by its dissolution. In <italic>dcm1</italic>, callose around PMCs was deposited normally during leptotene and disappeared during pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007769.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Similarly, prematurely dissolution of callosic plates occurred during telophase I and telophase II in the mutant. It seems that the dynamic changes in callose (deposition and dissolution) in <italic>dcm1</italic> reflect the antagonism between callose synthesis and degradation. We speculate that the defective callose metabolism in <italic>dcm1</italic> is caused by unwanted RNAs that are eliminated in the presence of DCM1. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the expression of some callose-related genes is affected by the mutation of <italic>CALLOSE DEFECTIVE MICROSPORE1</italic> (<italic>CDM1</italic>), a gene encoding a tandem CCCH-type zinc finger protein [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. <italic>CalS5</italic>, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene responsible for callose deposition surrounding the PMCs, tetrads and microspores, is regulated in a post-transcription manner [<xref rid="pgen.1007769.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We checked the expression level, splicing and polyadenylation site of <italic>OsGSL5</italic> gene and no significant differences were found between <italic>dcm1</italic> and wild type.
