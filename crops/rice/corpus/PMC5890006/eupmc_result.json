    "Hybrid rice has been successfully used for commercial rice production for 40 years in China. Shanyou 63, a mega rice hybrid, derived from the parents Zhenshan 97A and Minghui 63, was a milestone for China's hybrid rice development and production because of its high yield and wide adaptability. It was planted in 16 provinces of the country on 17% of the national hybrid rice area annually during the 29Â years from 1984 to 2012. The hybrid and its parents have also been widely used for basic and agronomic studies related to rice heterosis, stress tolerance, molecular markers and genomics. We review the development of the hybrid and its parents and their major characteristics for the purpose of learning from the history and guiding future hybrid rice development. The history and development experience show that a successful hybrid rice variety should have multiple traits, including high yield, wide adaptability, resistances to major diseases, and high rice quality that meets the demands of consumers. From the breeding aspect, hybrid rice provides the advantage of combining elite traits or genes from different types of parents, such as those from subspecies of indica and japonica, into a single variety. Farmers prefer not only a variety with high yield potential, but also stable yields and local adaptability."
