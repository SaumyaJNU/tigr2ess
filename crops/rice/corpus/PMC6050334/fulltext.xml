This study was conducted to determine the effect on rice yield of earthworm castings produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields and to identify the critical factors that contribute to the yield effect. Field microplot experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, a rice cultivar was grown under a factorial combination of absence (EC<sub>0</sub>: 0&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and presence of earthworm castings (EC<sub>1</sub>: 17&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) with three N application rates (9, 12 and 15&#x02009;g&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). In 2017, nine rice cultivars were grown under EC<sub>0</sub> and EC<sub>1</sub> with the moderate N rate as was used in 2016. Results showed that application of earthworm castings produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields had a significant positive yield effect on rice. This was attributed to increased panicle m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and total aboveground biomass while spikelets panicle<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, spikelet filling percentage, grain weight, and harvest index were not affected. Our study indirectly provides a new evidence that oilseed rape is an excellent previous crop for cereals.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is a major staple food for almost 50% of the world&#x02019;s population, and rice fields account for more than 12% of the global cropland area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Of these rice fields, nearly 90% are located in Asia (World Rice Statistics database, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrs">http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrs</ext-link>, hereinafter referred to as WRS database). In order to produce enough food for rapidly growing populations, agricultural land use in Asia has become very intense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the past 50 years, the intensification of rice-based cropping systems has helped ensure production of sufficient rice and other food crops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the continuous intensive practice of rice-based cropping systems such as rice-wheat cropping system practiced for several decades has led to declines in productivity and raised concerns about sustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">China is one of the major rice-producing countries in the world with an area of about 30 million hectares, accounting for approximately 20% of the world&#x02019;s rice field area (WRS database). Rice-based cropping systems are diverse in China due to differences in agro-climatic zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Among those cropping systems, rice-wheat and rice-oilseed rape are two long-established major ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast to the concerns about sustainability of continuous rice-wheat cropping system as mentioned above, our study suggests that long-term rice-oilseed rape cropping system can increase soil fertility and consequently reduce the dependence on external nitrogen (N) inputs and adverse impacts on the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This supports the viewpoint that oilseed rape is an excellent and sustainable previous crop for cereals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Such a viewpoint also can be supported by our recent investigations which showed that in-field earthworm density during the non-rice growing season was doubled by planting oilseed rape as compared to fallow in long-term, no-tillage rice-based fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although the earthworms are likely to migrate away from fields during the early stage of rice-growing when rice fields are flooded (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), their castings will remain in the fields (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). These facts indicate that growing oilseed rape as a previous crop for rice can enhance earthworm activity and hence may provide similar benefits as the option of applying the earthworm castings as fertilizer, especially in regions that are kept on fallow during the non-rice growing season. This aroused our interest to investigate the effect of the earthworm castings produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields on grain yield in rice. As a consequence, we conducted a pot experiment and found that grain yield was increased in a rice cultivar with application of the earthworm castings collected from oilseed rape fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, this finding could be subject to the constraints of pot cultivation and cultivar specificity. Therefore, more experimentation should be done under field conditions with various rice cultivars to obtain more concrete results.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Earthworms migrated away from the rice field after flooding (<bold>A</bold>), earthworm castings produced in the oilseed rape-growing season (<bold>B</bold>), and earthworm castings collected after harvesting the oilseed rape (<bold>C</bold>).

Sink size is considered as the primary determinant of the rice yield, and it can be increased either by increasing the number of panicles or panicle size (spikelets per panicle), or both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Because a strong compensation mechanism exists between the two yield components, a concurrent increase in them is not easy to achieve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Increasing panicle size is a common approach for the rice breeders to enhance the sink size and consequently to improve rice yield potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, there has contradictory statement that more panicle number should be emphasized to achieve higher grain yield in the super hybrid rice with large panicle size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In another approach, grain yield of rice is a function of total aboveground biomass and harvest index. It is generally accepted that achieving greater rice yields depends on increasing total aboveground biomass, because there is little scope to achieve further increases in the harvest index under favorable conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The harvest index of modern high-yielding rice is around 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, in recent years there have been reports that high grain yield can achieved in rice with high harvest index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In our present study, grain yield and yield attributes in rice were compared between with and without applications of earthworm castings that were produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields in two-year field microplot experiments. Our objectives were to (1) determine the effect on rice yield of earthworm castings produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields, and (2) identify the critical factors that contributed to this yield effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">In 2016, grain yield was significantly affected by earthworm casting treatment, but not by N rate and the interaction between earthworm casting treatment and N rate (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

This finding is not in agreement with the predominant standpoint among rice breeders that increasing panicle size is the most promising approach to enhancing sink size and consequently improving rice yield potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">More interestingly, the increased panicle number induced by the application of earthworm castings did not cause a significant decrease in panicle size in this study. This result is inconsistent with previous studies, such as Ying <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which reported that there was a compensation between the two yield components. Moreover, in the present study, the enhanced sink size was achieved not at the expense of spikelet filling percentage and grain weight in rice that has been grown with earthworm castings applied. These results demonstrated that compatible relationships among yield components were established in rice with the application of earthworm castings. In this regard, it is suggested that increasing biomass production is a feasible way to decouple the compensations among yield components in cereals including rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this study, a higher total aboveground biomass was achieved in rice applied with earthworm castings, which could be responsible for the compatible relationships among yield components in rice with the application of earthworm castings.</p><p id="Par17">On the other hand, the results of total aboveground biomass and harvest index revealed that there was a positive yield effect from the application of earthworm castings which was mainly driven by increased total aboveground biomass rather than harvest index. This is not surprising because it has been well-documented that there is little scope to further increase in harvest index under favorable conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, perhaps interestingly, the application of earthworm significantly did not decrease and even slightly increased harvest index. This is different from the effect of application of chemical fertilizer N on rice, in which harvest index is generally decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Harvest index is determined by the remobilization of stored reserves into the growing grain and the transient photosynthesis during grain formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. An increase in the former is usually achieved accompanied with early senescence and shortened grain-filling duration, which can be induced by unfavorable conditions such as water stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, this must not be the case in the present study, because we observed that the application of earthworm castings made the rice leaves greener during the grain-filling period. Therefore, the slightly increased harvest index might be related to the transient photosynthesis during grain formation in rice applied with earthworm castings in this study. This highlights that further investigations are needed to determine the effect of application of earthworm castings on photosynthetic characteristics during the ripening period in rice.</p><p id="Par18">Decreasing N rate from 150 to 90&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> did not result in significant yield reduction in the hybrid rice cultivar Liangyoupeijiu in 2016. Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> determined N response of this cultivar over a wide range of N rates (60&#x02013;410&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Their results showed that Liangyoupeijiu required a minimum total N rate of 120&#x02013;150&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to produce maximum grain yield. These suggest that the hybrid rice Liangyoupeijiu does not necessarily need more N fertilizer to produce high grain yield. Consistent with this, Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> have observed that higher grain yield in hybrid rice is mainly driven from a higher grain yield without N fertilizer rather than increases in grain yield with N fertilizer. This suggests that greater application of N fertilizer is not needed to benefit from hybrid production and that improving and maintaining soil fertility should be the focus for sustaining hybrid rice production. This can be further supported by this study&#x02019;s results in 2016 that the total N uptake mainly depended on non-fertilizer N uptake in the hybrid rice cultivar Liangyoupeijiu. The non-fertilizer and fertilizer N uptake accounted for 87% and 13% of the total N uptake, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, the positive effect of application of earthworm castings on panicle number, total aboveground biomass, and grain yield in 2016 also could be explained by an increase in non-fertilizer N uptake. The increased non-fertilizer N uptake under application of earthworm castings was partially due to that the earthworm castings contained a certain amount of available N.</p><p id="Par19">Significant cultivar differences in grain yield were detected in 2017. Inbred cultivars generally produced lower grain yields than did hybrid cultivars. The lower grain yields of inbred cultivars were mainly attributed to lower grain weight and to lower total aboveground biomass. When comparison was made among the hybrid cultivars, the lowest grain yield was recorded in Liangyoupeijiu, which was released in 1999 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The yield difference was small among the other six hybrid cultivars, which were released during 2008 to 2016 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It seems that the breeding effort did not contribute much to increased rice yield in the past decade. Also interestingly, the six high-yielding hybrid cultivars could be divided into four groups according to their yield component performance: (1) Longliangyou 97, Xiangliangyou 396 and Y-liangyou 1 are characterized by more panicle number, (2) Y-liangyou 2 is distinguished for its large panicle size, (3) Shenliangyou 5814 has a higher spikelet filling percentage, and (4) Zhunliangyou 608 is notable for its large grain size. This suggests that there are multiple strategies or pathways for developing high-yielding hybrid rice cultivars.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par20">Application of earthworm castings produced during the oilseed rape-growing season in rice-oilseed rape cropping fields had a significant positive yield effect on rice.
