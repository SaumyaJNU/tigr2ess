    "This study was designed to investigate the influence of cooking on the glycemic index (GI), amylose, and amylopectin contents of two rice varieties. Two rice varieties (foreign long rice and ofada) were sourced for, divided into two, one portion cooked and the other used raw. The sugar, starch, amylose, and amylopectin contents as well as glycemic indices, antioxidant properties, and the ability of the rice to inhibit carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) were determined. In addition, polyphenol content was determined. The results revealed that cooking caused a significant increase in starch content of the rice varieties. In the same vein, cooking increases the amylopectin content but has no effect on the amylose content. In addition, cooking shows no effect on polyphenol content but significantly increases radical scavenging ability of rice varieties used in this study. Furthermore, cooking lower the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory properties of two rice varieties except for foreign rice. However, the inhibitory effect of both cooked and raw foreign and ofada rice on α-amylase and α-glucosidase coupled with their low GI may explain their important role in controlling blood glucose level."
