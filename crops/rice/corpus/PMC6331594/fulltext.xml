In this study, field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to determine whether the response of grain yield to reducing N rate varied between double-season rice (DSR) and single-season rice (SSR). Three N rates were applied for each rice crop, i.e. 150&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (N150, the locally recommended N rate), 90&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (N90), and 0&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (N0). Grain yield was lower under N90 than under N150 in DSR by 11&#x02013;18%, whereas the difference was not significant in SSR. Grain yield under N0 was 36&#x02013;63% lower in DSR than in SSR. There was a significant relationship between percentage change in grain yield comparing N90 to N150 with grain yield under N0. Furthermore, it was observed that grain yield under N0 was not significantly associated with growth duration but was closely associated with daily grain yield under N0, and the relationships of daily grain yield under N0 with seasonal average daily mean temperature and solar radiation were not significant. These results indicate that response of grain yield to reducing N rate was more sensitive in DSR compared to SSR due to lower soil N productivity. Growth duration and climatic conditions did not explain the difference in soil N productivity between DSR and SSR. The findings of this study should encourage more research into comparing the inherent traits of plants, especially the morphology and physiology of the root system, between DSR and SSR.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rice is the staple food crop for about 65% of the population in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the past several decades, rice yield has more than tripled in China as a result of the development of new cultivars and improved crop management practices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This increase in rice yield has been important for ensuring food security in China. However, at the same time, fertilizer consumption in China has had an almost linear increase, especially for nitrogen (N) fertilizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The average N application rate for rice production in China at present is 180&#x02009;kg&#x02009;ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is about 75% higher than the world average<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The high N rate has caused substantial environmental costs including enhanced N deposition, soil acidification, and surface water eutrophication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, reducing the N rate without sacrificing grain yield is necessary for sustainable rice production in China.</p><p id="Par3">The capacity of productivity in a soil is referred to as inherent soil productivity and can be expressed by the actual crop yield without fertilizer inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Improving soil fertility is an effective way to achieve high inherent soil productivity and consequently reduce the dependence on external fertilizer inputs in rice production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition to the soil conditions, the inherent soil productivity also can be affected by the crop. For example, Huang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> observed that inherent soil N productivity (i.e. grain yield without N application) was increased with the development of new rice cultivars in China.</p><p id="Par4">Hunan province is one of the major rice-producing provinces in China and contributes more than 10% of total rice production (World Rice Statistics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrs">http://ricestat.irri.org:8080/wrs</ext-link>). There are two rice cropping systems in this province: (1) double-season rice (DSR) cropping with early-season rice (ESR) grown from March (sowing) to July (harvesting) and late-season rice (LSR) grown from June to October; and (2) single-season rice (SSR) cropping from April to September. Growth duration is shorter in DSR compared to SSR. This difference in growth duration can result in shorter duration of soil N uptake and consequently may cause lower soil N productivity in DSR than in SSR. Moreover, climatic conditions during growing-seasons are also different between DSR and SSR. In general, seasonal average temperature and solar radiation are lower in DSR than in SSR, because ESR and LSR have lower temperature and solar radiation than SSR during the early and late growth periods, respectively. These differences in temperature and solar radiation may lead to slower crop growth and hence lower soil N productivity in DSR compared to SSR. The potentially different soil N productivity resulted from differences in growth duration, and climatic conditions may further lead to different N responses between DSR and SSR, but no studies have been conducted to confirm and clarify these differences.</p><p id="Par5">In the present study, we compared DSR and SSR under three N rates (recommended, reduced, and zero N rate) in two years. Our objectives were (1) to determine whether the response of grain yield to reducing N rate is different between DSR and SSR, and if so, (2) to identify the factors that contribute to the difference in N response between DSR and SSR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">Average daily mean temperatures during early and late rice-growing seasons were lower than that during the single rice-growing season by 1.8&#x02013;4.1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 2016 and by 1.1&#x02013;3.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 2017 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x02013;f</xref>).

The regression equation of this relationship shows that the percentage change in grain yield comparing N90 to N150 was reduced by about 2.5% for each 1 t ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase in grain yield under N0.

More importantly, the results of this study suggest that the magnitude of the potential of reducing N rate may be smaller in DSR than in SSR due to lower soil N productivity.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Relationship between percentage change in grain yield comparing N90 to N150 with grain yield under N0 in rice.

These observations are not consistent with our initial expectation that the differences in growth duration and climatic conditions may result in different soil N productivity between DSR and SSR. These results also suggest that the different soil N productivity between DSR and SSR might mainly depend on the plant&#x02019;s inherent traits.
