    "To facilitate developing rice varieties tolerant to salt stress, a panel of 208 rice mini-core accessions collected from 25 countries were evaluated for 13 traits associated with salt tolerance (ST) at the germination and seedling stages. The rice panel showed tremendous variation for all measured ST traits and eight accessions showing high levels of ST at either and/or both the germination and seedling stages. Using 395,553 SNP markers covering ~372â€‰Mb of the rice genome and multi-locus mixed linear models, 20 QTN associated with 11 ST traits were identified by GWAS, including 6 QTN affecting ST at the germination stage and 14 QTN for ST at the seedling stage. The integration of bioinformatic with haplotype analyses for the ST QTN lets us identify 22 candidate genes for nine important ST QTN (qGR3, qSNK1, qSNK12, qSNC1, qSNC6, qRNK2, qSDW9a, qSST5 and qSST9). These candidate genes included three known ST genes (SKC1, OsTZF1 and OsEATB) for QTN qSNK1 qSST5 and qSST9. Candidate genes showed significant phenotypic differences in ST traits were detected between or among 2-4 major haplotypes. Thus, our results provided useful materials and genetic information for improving rice ST in future breeding and for molecular dissection of ST in rice."
