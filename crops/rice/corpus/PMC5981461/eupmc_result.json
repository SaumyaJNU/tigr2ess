    "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the essential staple food crops and tillering, panicle branching and grain filling are three important traits determining the grain yield. Although miRNAs have been reported being regulating yield, no study has systematically investigated how miRNAs differentially function in high and low yield rice, in particular at a network level. This abundance of data from high-throughput sequencing provides an effective solution for systematic identification of regulatory miRNAs using developed algorithms in plants. We here present a novel algorithm, Gene Co-expression Network differential edge-like transformation (GRN-DET), which can identify key regulatory miRNAs in plant development. Based on the small RNA and RNA-seq data, miRNA-gene-TF co-regulation networks were constructed for yield of rice. Using GRN-DET, the key regulatory miRNAs for rice yield were characterized by the differential expression variances of miRNAs and co-variances of miRNA-mRNA, including osa-miR171 and osa-miR1432. Phytohormone cross-talks (auxin and brassinosteroid) were also revealed by these co-expression networks for the yield of rice."
