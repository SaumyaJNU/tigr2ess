    "Chitin synthase is responsible for chitin synthesis in the cuticles and cuticular linings of other tissues in insects. We cloned two alternative splicing variants of the chitin synthase 1 gene (SfCHS1) from the white-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera. The full-length cDNA of the two variants (SfCHS1a and SfCHS1b) consists of 6408 bp, contains a 4719-bp open reading frame encoding 1572 amino acids, and has 5' and 3' non-coding regions of 283 and 1406 bp, respectively. The two splicing variants occur at the same position in the cDNA sequence between base pairs 4115 and 4291, and consist of 177 nucleotides that encode 59 amino acids but show 74.6% identity at the amino acid level. Analysis in different developmental stages showed that expression of SfCHS1 and SfCHS1a were highest just after molting, whereas SfCHS1b reached its highest expression level 2 days after molting. Further, SfCHS1 and SfCHS1a were mainly expressed in the integument, whereas SfCHS1b was predominately expressed in the gut and fat body. RNAi-based gene silencing inhibited transcript levels of the corresponding mRNAs in S. furcifera nymphs injected with double-stranded RNA of SfCHS1, SfCHS1a, and SfCHS1b, resulted in malformed phenotypes, and killed most of the treated nymphs. Our results indicate that SfCHS1 may be a potential target gene for RNAi-based S. furcifera control."
