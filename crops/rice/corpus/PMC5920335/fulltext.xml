Upon double fertilization, two sperm cells are delivered into an embryo sac via a pollen tube. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form a zygote with a 1:1 maternal-to-paternal genome ratio (1m:1p), and the other sperm cell fuses with the central cell to form a triploid primary endosperm cell with a 2m:1p ratio. These zygote and primary endosperm cells develop, respectively, into the embryo that transmits genetic material from the parents to the next generation and the endosperm that nourishes the developing embryo and seedling (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Nawaschin, 1898</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Guignard, 1899</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Russell, 1992</xref>).</p><p>A seed consists of three tissues with different parental genomic content: embryo (1m:1p), endosperm (2m:1p), and maternal seed coat (2m:0p). Of the three tissues, the endosperm is known to be considerably sensitive to ploidy differences between parents (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Haig and Westoby, 1991</xref>). In Arabidopsis seeds prepared by paternal-excess crosses between diploid and tetraploid plants (2<italic>x</italic> female&#x000d7;4<italic>x</italic> male), cellularization of endosperm was delayed, and the size of seeds was enlarged. However, maternal-excess crosses (4<italic>x</italic> female&#x000d7;2<italic>x</italic> male) promoted precocious endosperm cellularization and produced small seeds (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, reciprocal crosses between diploid and hexaploid plants (2<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;6<italic>x</italic> and 6<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;2<italic>x</italic>) showed a more extreme phenotype than those between diploid and tetraploid plants, and resulted in seed abortion with only small and shriveled seeds (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The effects of ploidy differences in parents on endosperm development were also investigated in rice, and similar cellularization characteristics of endosperm was observed (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Sekine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The effects of parental imbalance on endosperm development have been partly explained by epigenetic regulation of the parental genome (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Feil and Berger, 2007</xref>).</p><p>As for embryo development, Arabidopsis embryos derived from reciprocal crosses between diploid and hexaploid plants aborted at the globular to heart stage (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In rice, swollen embryos were observed in seeds from the 4<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;2<italic>x</italic> maternal-excess cross, and no embryo-like structures were detected in seeds from the 2<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;4<italic>x</italic> paternal-excess cross (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Sekine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Although development of a zygote also appeared to be affected by interploidy crosses both in Arabidopsis and in rice, it is thought that abnormality in zygotic embryogenesis by an interploid cross is not due to a parental imbalance in zygotes or embryos but to a side effect of the developmental defects of endosperm induced by a parental imbalance, because endosperm functions as a possible growth regulator to the developing embryo and is considered to be of primary importance in seed development (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Brink and Cooper, 1947</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Vijayaraghavan and Prabhakar, 1984</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Lopes and Larkins, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Berger, 2003</xref>). Moreover, arrested embryos in developing seeds from an interploid cross can often be grown into plantlets when the embryos are isolated from the seeds and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), supporting the consideration that an imbalanced parental genome disturbs the development of endosperm more severely than that of a zygote or embryo. However, success in embryo rescue is often dependent on the direction of crossing. For example, rice 2m:1p embryos, which were isolated from the 4<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;2<italic>x</italic> crossed developing seeds, grew into plantlets via tissue culture; however, no successful embryo rescue was observed when 1m:2p embryos isolated from the 2<italic>x</italic>&#x000d7;4<italic>x</italic> crossed developing seeds were cultured (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Sekine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). These results suggest that an imbalance of the parental genome may affect the development of zygotes as well as endosperms. However, the precise effect of an imbalance of the parental genome in zygotic development and embryogenesis has not been addressed, because it is difficult to reproduce the parental genome-imbalanced situation in zygotes and to observe the precise developmental profiles of such zygotes without the influence of endosperm, which is tissue neighboring the zygote/embryo.</p><p>Herein, in order to address distinctly whether zygotic development is dependent on the balance of the parental genome, we produced a polyploid zygote with an imbalanced parental genome ratio by <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization using isolated rice gametes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Uchiumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and observed the developmental profiles of such polyploid zygotes by single cell culture. Most polyploid zygotes with an excess maternal gamete/genome developed normally as diploid zygotes, whereas approximately half to three-quarters of polyploid zygotes with a paternal excess showed developmental arrests. These results suggested that parental genomes are synergistically utilized in zygotes with different functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and isolation of gametes</title><p>

These results suggested that a double to quintuple dose of a maternal genome/genetic material in a zygote has no negative effect on the developmental profiles of zygotes. In contrast to a maternal excess in zygotes, our previous and present studies indicated that polyspermic rice zygotes, which were produced by serial fusion of an egg cell with two sperm cells, showed defects in zygotic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the 34 polyspermic zygotes, 15 showed arrest in early zygotic development, although the remaining 19 zygotes mostly developed further into asymmetric two-celled embryos, globular-like embryos, and a callus structure (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the developmental profile of polyspermic zygotes was mainly disrupted at the step of first division of the zygote. These results suggest that an excess in the paternal genome/genetic material in zygotes triggers the developmental arrests. However, it remains unclear whether the developmental arrest in polyspermic zygotes is due to delivery of a double dose of genetic material from two sperm cells into an egg cell or the physiological shock of repeated and sequential electro-fusion of two sperm cells. Therefore, we next planned to produce paternal-excess triploid zygotes by single fusion of a haploid egg cell with a diploid sperm cell, which was isolated from tetraploid rice plants, and observe their developmental profiles. To check the cellular quality of diploid gametes, male and female gametes isolated from the flowers of tetraploid rice plants were fused, and the resulting possible tetraploid zygotes were cultured and regenerated. The results showed that possible tetraploid zygotes developed into early embryos, cell masses and plantlets, and they were determined to be tetraploid by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), suggesting that gametes isolated from tetraploid plants can be used as diploid gametes. Therefore, paternal-excess triploid zygotes were prepared using pairs of haploid and diploid gametes.</p><p>Paternal-excess triploid zygotes produced by fusion of a haploid egg cell and a diploid sperm cell, termed E2S zygotes, showed arrests in zygotic development, as did the polyspermic triploid zygotes, termed ESS zygotes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of E2S zygotes showed defects in karyogamy in addition to the first cell division, although only a few ESS zygotes showed abnormality in karyogamy (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The difference in karyogamy progression between E2S and ESS zygotes may be explained by abnormal or excess activation of the fused egg cell, such as an inappropriate fertilization-induced increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Denninger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Hamamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), which is triggered by immediate delivery of a double dose of cellular contents from a diploid sperm cell into an egg cell.</p><p>Notably, developmental arrest after karyogamy was detected at the step of the first cell division of paternal-excess triploid zygotes. Approximately one-third of ESS zygotes (11 out of 30 zygotes) and of E2S zygote (3 out of 7 zygotes) could not divide and degenerated (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It has been indicated that the nascent synthesis of transcripts from zygotic parental genomes in zygotes is initiated either during karyogamy or within hours after fertilization in maize (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Scholten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Scholten, 2007</xref>), wheat (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Sprunck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Ueda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Nodine and Bartel, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Del Toro-De Leon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), and tobacco (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Ning <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). In rice zygotes, it has been reported that <italic>de novo</italic> zygotic gene expression, termed zygotic genome activation (ZGA), was initiated around 4 h after gamete fusion, during which karyogamy was mostly completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ohnishi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).

This indicates that genes expressed in zygotes via ZGA will play important roles in zygotic development. The common developmental step that was disrupted in both E2S and ESS zygotes was the first cell division of the zygote, suggesting this developmental step is highly sensitive to an excess of the paternal genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Taken together, it is strongly suggested that ZGA-dependent gene expression profiles in zygotes might be partly disrupted by a parental genome imbalance, and subsequent zygotic development did not progress correctly.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>A schematic diagram of the progression of early development of rice zygote.

C, cytoplasm rich region; E, egg nucleus; S, sperm nucleus; V, vacuoles Z, zygote nucleus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ery09407"/></fig><p>Genes that are specifically or preferentially expressed from a paternal or maternal allele in zygotes or early embryos have been identified in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gehring <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Raissig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), maize (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Jahnke and Scholten, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) and rice (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). These possible parent of origin genes have been thought to play essential roles in the early development of zygotes and embryogenesis in angiosperms, although the mechanisms of regulation of expression of these genes and their gene functions still need to be explored (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Luo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Baroux and Grossniklaus, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The present study provides direct evidence for the importance of parental balance in zygotes at the cellular level and for the possibility that genes that will be expressed specifically or preferentially from the paternal allele in early zygotes have a regulatory role in zygotic development. Investigations toward identification of such genes in rice zygotes are underway in our laboratories.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
