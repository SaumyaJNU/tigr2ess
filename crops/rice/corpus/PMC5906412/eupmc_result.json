    "Cold stress can cause serious abiotic damage that limits the growth, development and yield of rice. Cold tolerance during the booting stage of rice is a key factor that can guarantee a high and stable yield under cold stress. The cold tolerance of rice is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Based on the complex genetic basis of cold tolerance in rice, additional efforts are needed to detect reliable QTLs and identify candidate genes. In this study, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between a cold sensitive variety, Dongnong422, and strongly cold-tolerant variety, Kongyu131, were used to screen for cold-tolerant loci at the booting stage of rice.A novel major QTL, qPSST6, controlling the percent seed set under cold water treatment (PSST) under the field conditions of 17 °C cold water irrigation was located on the 28.4 cM interval on chromosome 6. Using the combination of bulked-segregant analysis (BSA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology (Seq-BSA), a 1.81 Mb region that contains 269 predicted genes on chromosome 6 was identified as the candidate region of qPSST6. Two genes, LOC_Os06g39740 and LOC_Os06g39750, were annotated as \"response to cold\" by gene ontology (GO) analysis. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that LOC_Os06g39750 was strongly induced by cold stress. Haplotype analysis also demonstrate a key role of LOC_Os06g39750 in regulating the PSST of rice, suggesting that it was the candidate gene of qPSST6.The information obtained in this study is useful for gene cloning of qPSST6 and for breeding cold-tolerant varieties of rice using marker assisted selection (MAS)."
