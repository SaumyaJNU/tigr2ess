We found that the consumption of rice miso led to improvements in the moisture content of cheek stratum corneum, skin viscoelasticity, and skin texture. Further, rice miso extract was found to increase the mRNA expression and activity of &#x003b2;-glucocerebrosidase (&#x003b2;-GCase), an enzyme involved in ceramide synthesis in the stratum corneum, in cultures. In this study, we identified the lipid-derived components of rice <italic>koji</italic> that increase the &#x003b2;-GCase activity in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. The methanol fraction of rice <italic>koji</italic> extract induced an increase in the mRNA expression and activity of &#x003b2;-GCase in keratinocytes. The active fraction of rice <italic>koji</italic> was found to contain phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The total PA concentration in rice <italic>koji</italic> was 973.9 ng/mg dry weight, which was 17.5 times higher than that in steamed rice. Among the molecular species, PA_18:2/18:2 was the most frequently found. The total LPA concentration in rice <italic>koji</italic> was 29.6 ng/mg dry weight, and 2-LPA_18:2 was the most frequently found LPA.

Introduction</title><p>Rice <italic>koji</italic>, which is a solid-state culture of <italic>koji</italic> molds (<italic>Aspergilus oryzae</italic>) in rice, is used as a raw material for rice miso. Rice miso contains many ingredients derived from rice <italic>koji</italic> and has been a valuable source of nutrition since ancient times. We found that ingesting rice miso improved the moisture content in cheek stratum corneum, skin viscoelasticity, and texture [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the effect of miso extract on ceramide synthesis in epidermal keratinocytes was examined in cultured cells, and the mRNA expression and activity of glucocerebrosidase (&#x003b2;-GCase) in these cells increased when the cells were treated with miso extract [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. From these results, it was hypothesized that the moisture level of the skin improves by everyday consumption of miso soup made from rice miso and that this may occur via increasing the ceramide content of the stratum corneum [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>A. oryzae</italic> produces and secretes many types of enzymes, including &#x003b1;-amylase, which degrades starch; glucoamylase; transglucosidase; acid protease, which degrades protein; and acidic carboxypeptidase [<xref rid="B2-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as it grows. In addition, rice <italic>koji</italic> contains various nutrients and supplies the necessary nutrients for yeast and lactic acid bacteria. These nutrients are especially rich in vitamins of the B group and include molybdenum; biotin; vitamins B1, B2, and B6; folic acid; pantothenic acid; and niacin [<xref rid="B4-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, mono- and diacylglycerol are converted to free fatty acids by the lipid-decomposing enzymes of rice <italic>koji</italic> [<xref rid="B5-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and other studies have suggested that the free fatty acid content in miso contributes to its antimutagenic activities [<xref rid="B6-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The main constituent fatty acids of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> are lignoceric acid and, particularly, 2-oxy lignoceric acid and 2,3-dioxyl lignoceric acid, with phytosphingosine reported as the major long-chain constituent [<xref rid="B7-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rice bran malt contains a bifidobacterial growth-promoting substance and glucosylceramide, which improve intestinal bacterial flora in mice [<xref rid="B8-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has also been reported that <italic>A. oryzae</italic> exhibits antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B10-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and produces multiple cathepsin B-inhibiting components [<xref rid="B11-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Rice <italic>koji</italic> is used for most Japanese fermented foods, including miso, soy sauce, amazake, Japanese sake, and malt vinegar. Rice <italic>koji</italic> and sake lees have also been used as cosmetics and skin moisturizing agents for many years.

For a determination of LPA concentration, the lysophospholipid fraction was methyl-esterified using a fatty acid methyl esterification kit (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), and the products were analyzed by GC-flame ionization detection (FID) (TC-WAX, GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 1-LPA_C18:1 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was used as a standard.

Discussion</title><p>The stratum corneum intercellular lipids, which extend into the intercellular space of the stratum corneum (extracellular stratum corneum lipids), act as a barrier between the epidermis and the air of the outside world and are critical to preventing the transpiration of moisture from inside the body and moisture ingression from outside the body. When this barrier is damaged, excessive evaporation occurs, and the stratum corneum becomes dehydrated, while further deterioration causes allergic reactions in the skin, such as rough skin and atopic dermatitis [<xref rid="B13-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The intercellular lipids consist of ceramides (37%), cholesterols (32%), long-chain fatty acids (16%), and cholesterol esters (15%) and form a multilayered lamellar lipid structure [<xref rid="B16-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among these components, ceramides are particularly important in the stratum corneum and are present in amounts 30 times or greater in the stratum corneum than in other organs. The stratum corneum ceramides are characterized not only by their large quantity, but also by the presence of various kinds of molecules [<xref rid="B17-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Acylceramide, which is important for skin barrier function, is produced by &#x003b2;-GCase from acylglucosylceramide [<xref rid="B19-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, some ceramides are produced from both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin [<xref rid="B21-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>We showed that the mRNA expression and activity of &#x003b2;-GCase, which is an enzyme involved in ceramide synthesis in the stratum corneum, increases with exposure to rice miso extract [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The levels of phytosphingosine- and sphingosine-type ceramides increase after such exposure [<xref rid="B1-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. During the fermentation of miso, various functional substances are produced by the enzymatic action of various fermenting microorganisms. For example, miso contains functional substances, such as essential fatty acids (linoleic acid and linolenic acid), and acylphosphatidic acid is produced by <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> [<xref rid="B23-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, to investigate whether ceramide synthesis is involved in the skin improvement effects of rice <italic>koji</italic>, we examined the effects of the lipid component of rice <italic>koji</italic> on the mRNA level and activity of &#x003b2;-GCase in cultured keratinocytes. We found that both the mRNA level and activity of &#x003b2;-GCase were increased in cells treated with a methanol fraction of rice <italic>koji</italic> extract and with PA and LPA. In addition, when a methanol fraction of rice <italic>koji</italic> extract, PA, and LPA were allowed to act on the three-dimensional human epidermal skin model, a decrease in TEWL and increases in &#x003b2;-GCase activity and &#x003b2;-GCase mRNA expression occurred. On the other hand, the chloroform and acetone fractions of rice <italic>koji</italic> extract had no such effect. Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) contains phospholipase A1 and phospholipase A2 [<xref rid="B24-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and rice bran oil contains phospholipase D [<xref rid="B25-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since steamed rice is used for the production of rice <italic>koji</italic>, these enzymes are thought to be inactivated. On the other hand, <italic>A. oryzae</italic> produces phospholipase A1 [<xref rid="B27-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Rice bran oil contains phospholipids [<xref rid="B29-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and rice contains many PCs, which are phospholipids, and LPC_16:0 (3.0 to 4.7 &#x003bc;g/mL) and LPC_18:2 (0.8 to 2.2 &#x003bc;g/mL), which are both lysophospholipids [<xref rid="B30-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In our study, PA and LPA were included in rice <italic>koji</italic>, and since their concentrations were higher in rice <italic>koji</italic> than in steamed rice, the source of phospholipids was thought to be the rice. The abundance of 2-LPA was 14 times greater than that of 1-LPA in rice <italic>koji</italic>. The 2-LPA_18:2 species was the most frequently found, followed by 2-LPA_18:1, and the 1-LPA level was low in rice <italic>koji</italic>. From these results, PA was considered to be produced from PC by phospholipase D of <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, and 2-LPA was produced from PA by phospholipase A1. Furthermore, these results indicated that the activity of phospholipase A1 of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> was higher than that of phospholipase A2. However, since the PA content in rice <italic>koji</italic> was 10 times greater than the LPA content, the phospholipase A1 activity of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> was not thought to be high. In addition, 2-LPA may be produced by phospholipase D of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> from the 2-LC produced by phospholipase A1 of <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, but the pathway by which 1-LPA is produced from 1-LC via phospholipase D of <italic>A. oryzae</italic> contributes less. The activity of phospholipase D of orthologous genes has not been verified in <italic>A. oryzae</italic> [<xref rid="B31-foods-07-00094" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and further investigating the variations in phospholipase D for each <italic>A. oryzae</italic> strain is necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-foods-07-00094"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The methanol fraction of rice <italic>koji</italic> extract contains PA and LPA, both of which increase the mRNA expression and activity of &#x003b2;-GCase in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. Therefore, PA and LPA are thought to be among the active ingredients in rice <italic>koji</italic> that increase the &#x003b2;-GCase levels in human epidermal keratinocytes. The total PA in rice <italic>koji</italic> was 973.9 ng/mg dry weight, which was 17.5 times higher than that in the steamed rice used as the source of rice <italic>koji</italic>, and contained several molecular species, of which PA_18:2/18:2 was the most abundant.
