    "The response of plant root development to nutrient deficiencies is critical for crop production. Auxin, nitric oxide (NO), and strigolactones (SLs) are important regulators of root growth under low-nitrogen and -phosphate (LN and LP) conditions. Polar auxin transport in plants, which is mainly dependent on auxin efflux protein PINs, creates local auxin maxima to form the basis for root initiation and elongation; however, the PIN genes that play an important role in LN- and LP-modulated root growth remain unclear. qRT-PCR analysis of OsPIN family genes showed that the expression of OsPIN1b is most abundant in root tip and is significantly downregulated by LN, LP, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), and GR24 (analogue of SLs) treatments. Seminal roots in ospin1b mutants were shorter than those of the wild type; and the seminal root, [3H]IAA transport, and IAA concentration responses to LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 application were attenuated in ospin1b-1 mutants. pCYCB1;1::GUS expression was upregulated by LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 treatments in wild type, but not in the ospin1b-1 mutant, suggesting that OsPIN1b is involved in auxin transport and acts as a downstream mediator of NO and SLs to induce meristem activity in root tip in rice under LN and LP."
