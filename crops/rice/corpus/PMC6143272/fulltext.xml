Participants were diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand. Ten behavioural support groups consisting of 6 to 10 participants per group were conducted. Twelve behaviour change techniques were used: information about health consequences, credible source, adding objects to the environment, reconstructing the physical environment, instruction on how to perform a behaviour, demonstration of the behaviour, commitment, prompts/cues, self-monitoring of behaviour, goal setting, feedback on behaviour, and social support, and their feasibilities evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>There were 70 participants, of median age 59 years and 52 (74%) were female. Participants found the intervention beneficial, interesting and engaging. Participants indicated that they liked to watch videos with information about melioidosis delivered by local doctors and patients who survived melioidosis, and videos showing use of over-the-knee boots by local farmers. Participants felt engaged in the sessions that trialed protective gear and that made calendars with individual photographs and self-pledges as a reminder tool. The proportions of participants reporting that they always wore boots while working in rice fields increased from 30% (10/33) to 77% (28/37, p = 0.04), and that they drank only boiled or bottle water increased from 43% (30/70) to 86% (59/69, p&#x0003c;0.001) at 6 months post intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The programme is highly acceptable to participants, and can support behaviour change.

Infection in humans occurs following skin inoculation, inhalation or ingestion. The recommendations for melioidosis prevention include using protective gear such as rubber boots when in direct contact with soil and environmental water, and drinking only boiled or bottled water. A multifaceted prevention programme is recommended to achieve the desired behaviour changes. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and behavioural outcomes of a multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis. Our study participants were diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand. We found that the multifaceted prevention programme was highly acceptable to participants, and could support behaviour change. A calendar with an individual photograph as a reminder tool engaged participants effectively. Our study also confirmed that commitment and action by the government are essential for the preventive interventions to be successful. We recommend that policy makers should consider implementing the programme in areas where melioidosis is endemic. Since cultures and barriers to adopting the recommended behaviours vary, the intervention strategies would need to be adapted to local contexts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Wellcome Trust (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>101103/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7240-5320</contrib-id><name><surname>Limmathurotsakul</surname><given-names>Direk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number 101103/Z/13/Z].

A spatial modeling study estimated that there are about 165,000 human melioidosis cases per year worldwide, of which 89,000 (54%) die [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease is highly endemic and commonly reported in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where the mortality from melioidosis is about 40% and 14%, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Melioidosis occurs through ingestion, inoculation, or inhalation of the bacterium through direct contact with an environmental soil or surface water [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Diabetes mellitus is the most important predisposing factor for melioidosis, and is present in about half of all melioidosis patients [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, persons with diabetes are the main targets for disease prevention interventions. No melioidosis vaccine is currently available [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Activities associated with an increased risk of disease acquisition in Thailand, where disease is highly endemic, include working in a rice field, other activities associated with exposure to soil or water, and drinking untreated water [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The recommendations for disease prevention include using protective gear such as rubber boots when in direct contact with soil and environmental water, and consuming only boiled or bottled water [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, only a small proportion of people follow such recommendations [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Lack of adoption of these preventive behaviours still occurs in Thailand even though the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has been recommending wearing rubber boots and drinking boiled water, and provides free rubber boots to prevent leptospirosis since a rise in leptospirosis incidence in 1996 [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a previous focus group study, we identified barriers to adopting recommended preventive behaviours in Thailand [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main barriers were categorized into five domains: (i) knowledge, (ii) beliefs about consequences, (iii) intention and goals, (iv) environmental context and resources, and (v) social influence. People have little knowledge of melioidosis, believe that there is little or no harm in not adopting the recommended preventive behaviours, and are not inclined to use boots while working in muddy rice fields [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. People perceived rubber boots to be hot and uncomfortable, and they normally followed the behaviour of friends, family and their community, the majority of whom did not wear boots while working in rice fields and did not boil water before drinking [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>To change behaviour, interventions based on the factors that influence adherence to recommendations are needed [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In general, providing information and protective gear alone do not change their behaviour [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two related frameworks have been developed to support the investigation of a wide range of possible influences on behaviour: the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The TDF is a useful framework for understanding the barriers and factors influencing specific behaviours [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while the BCW is a comprehensive framework that links this understanding to designing interventions including the recommended behaviour change techniques (BCTs) [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using these frameworks, we previously selected recommended behaviours, defined barriers to adopting those recommended behaviours, identified intervention options and modes of delivery, and developed a multifaceted prevention programme including a set of BCTs aimed at changing behaviours to prevent melioidosis, based on the local context in Thailand [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, our aim was to evaluate the feasibility and behavioural outcomes of this multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in diabetic adults in Ubon Ratchathani, northeast Thailand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a study of a multifaceted prevention programme for melioidosis between April and December 2015. This was a small group intervention, in which 6 to 10 participants at a time attended a behavioural support group conducted by the study team. Each session lasted about 50 to 60 minutes. The intervention was provided once. Participants were then followed up by phone after one, two, four and five months, and by visiting homes on months three and six after the intervention. Feasibility of the intervention was determined by direct observation during the intervention, and by questionnaires and individual interviews after the intervention and at each follow-up. Components of the intervention were modified after each session based on feedback about feasibility. Two recommended preventive behaviours, wearing protective gear while working in rice fields and boiling water before drinking, were assessed prior to the intervention and at every follow-up by questionnaires and individual interviews.</p><p>The study sample was drawn from diabetic patients being followed up at five Tambon Health Promoting Hospitals (THPHs) in Ubon Ratchathani province, northeast Thailand. This comprised Non Noi THPH, Pak Kud Whai THPH, Pak Nam THPH, Ban Kok THPH and Hua Ruea THPH. THPHs are the first level of public health facility in Thailand.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>All patients attending for diabetic follow-up who had a physician-confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, were oriented and could converse normally were invited on the day by the study team to participate. Those who had been diagnosed with melioidosis and had not completed oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis were not eligible to participate because, per standard of care, those patients would be being advised to adopt the preventive behaviours to reduce the risk of melioidosis re-infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The sample size target was defined by practical and resource considerations as 60 to 100 participants attending 8 to 12 sessions. We ended the study with 70 participants having completed 10 sessions because there was no new feedback to modify the interventions further; saturation was reached. As we aimed to assess intervention and methods feasibility, not effectiveness in terms of either behavioural or clinical outcomes, we did not conduct power calculations.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Interventions</title><p>The interventions included 12 of 13 BCTs recommended in a focus group study evaluating barriers and recommended interventions to prevention melioidosis, conducted in Ubon Ratchathani province, Northeast Thailand in 2012 [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The recommended 13 BCTs include information about health consequences (e.g. explaining that not wearing boots while working in rice fields and that drinking untreated water can lead to an often fatal infectious disease called melioidosis), credible source (e.g. a high status professional in the government giving a speech that emphasises the importance of melioidosis prevention), adding objects to the environment (e.g. providing baby powder and long socks to alleviate the problem of discomfort due to heat and humidity when wearing boots), reconstructing the physical environment, instruction on how to perform a behaviour, demonstration of the behaviour, commitment, prompts/cues, self-monitoring of behaviour, goal setting, feedback on behaviour, feedback on outcome(s) of behaviour and social support [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The examples of BCTs specific to the two recommended preventive behaviours, wearing protective gear while working in rice fields and boiling water before drinking, had been previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The recommended BCT of &#x02018;feedback on outcome(s) of behaviour&#x02019; was not used because the study had short study duration and, therefore, could not determine clinical outcome of acquiring melioidosis over the study period. In this study, the objective of the intervention was to increase the frequency of the two recommended preventive behaviours: wearing boots while working in rice fields and dinking boiled or bottled water. Boiling water before drinking, rather than buying bottled water, was the main recommendation among those who were drinking untreated water. Buying bottled water was not primarily recommended because it could be considered expensive and it was not consistent with the national recommendation of boiling water before drinking [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Filtering water before drinking was not recommended because filters were rarely maintained properly and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>pseudomallei</italic> had been detected in filtered water samples previously [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The intervention package included six short videos, three pamphlets, and a calendar with a space for participants&#x02019; individual photographs and self-pledge. The materials are publicly available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5734155">https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5734155</ext-link>). Each participant also received a pair of long socks and a bottle of baby powder (to reduce itching inside boots) and a 2-litre plastic ice bucket commonly-used to store water to drink while working in rice fields. In each behavioural support group, participants received an introduction by a moderator, watched each short video, and had short group discussions at the end of each video to foster autonomous motivation for the recommended preventive behaviours. Participants then had a protective gear trial session, in which multiple kinds of boots were provided for participants to test them out for wearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006765.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Next, the study team took a photograph of each individual participant while wearing boots and holding a kettle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006765.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and printed photographs for each participant to use in the next session. Finally, participants attended a session to make their own calendar to act as a reminder tool for the recommended preventive behaviours. We asked participants to attach their individual photograph to the calendar and write their own pledge on the calendar by themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006765.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). It was recommended that the calendar be hung in participants&#x02019; houses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006765.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The moderator also stimulated group discussion during, before and after the sessions. Additionally, we provided social support by giving information to nurses, doctors, participants&#x02019; relatives and health volunteers in each participating THPH about the intervention and potential benefits of the intervention. We also ask them to encourage the participant to continue with the recommended behaviours.</p><fig id="pntd.0006765.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0006765.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The sessions that trialed protective gear and that made calendars with individual photographs and self-pledge as a reminder tool.</title><p>A.

Of 33 participants who worked in rice fields during the last week prior to the enrollment, six (18%) walked barefoot, 15 (45%) wore sandals, four (12%) wore boots sometimes and 10 (33%) wore boots every time while working in the rice fields. Boiling water from each source every time before drinking was reported in 2 of 4 participants (50%) who drank water from the well, 3 of 22 (14%) who drank borehole water, 4 of 14 (29%) who drank rainwater, and 8 of 29 (28%) who drank tap water.

Overall, 30 (43%) drank only boiled or bottled water.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Feasibility</title><p>During the first four sessions, we received many comments and advice from participants. Participants suggested that the duration of the videos should be shorter, and pointed to information that should be added to the videos or presented by local healthcare workers in the real local setting. Therefore, videos were revised and recut, and the median and maximum duration of the videos were reduced from 3 and 5 minutes to 1:30 and 3 minutes, respectively. The video showing that wearing boots can protect from being cut by golden apple snails was added. Videos showing how to boil water were remade and presented by local healthcare workers in the real local settings rather than presented by the study team in the urban setting.</p><p>Based on direct observation, we found that the script of the moderator to stimulate group discussion between each video was too long, and participants took a lot of time to come up with their own pledges. Therefore, the script was shortened and the study team made a list of common and recommended pledges for participants to see and modify for their own pledges. Examples of the pledge included, &#x0201c;I will always boil water before drinking&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I will always wear boots while working in the rice fields&#x0201d;.</p><p>At the end of the first three group sessions, we found that many participants could not remember the name of the disease and the recommended behaviours. Therefore, in the fourth group, a BCT of mental habit formation was employed by asking participants to shout three short two-part phrases repeatedly.

For each round, each phrase was repeated for three times, and this BCT was conducted for two rounds. Feedbacks at the end of the fourth group session about this BCT were good, and all participants could remember the name of the disease and the two main preventive behaviours.

Features of the sessions that participants reported beneficial were the information about disease, and learning that applying baby powder and long socks could make wearing boots comfortable. Most participants had never heard of the disease and the consequences of the disease. Participants indicated that they liked to watch videos about melioidosis delivered by local doctors, relatives of those who died of melioidosis, and patients who survived melioidosis in the local dialect.

Many participants reported that they saw over-the-knee boots available in the local market, but they had had no chance to try the boots and, therefore, had not known whether or not they would be comfortable and useful. We observed that most participants smiled while having their photos taken, holding their own photos, putting their photos on the calendar and writing their own pledges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006765.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Based on the interactions and discussions between participants, our judgement was that most participants enjoyed the activities. During the home visits at the third and sixth month follow-ups, we found that 63/70 (90%) and 62/69 (90%) had their calendars hanging in the house, respectively. Many participants reported that they liked their own photos, as they had never had their own photo printed, and the picture of themselves wearing boots and holding a kettle was a good reminder tool for the recommended preventive behaviours. During the home visiting, we also observed that all participants had their boots at home, and many participants informed us that they had never used those boots until they attended our sessions.

These positive outcomes could be mainly because the programme was designed systematically based on the identified barriers and enablers, using the TDF and associated BCW [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and taking into account the local context [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This may be the first study to show the efficacy of a calendar with an individual photograph as a reminder tool. The individual photograph of the participant wearing boots and holding a kettle could also be categorized as the BCTs &#x0201c;identification of self as role model&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;prompts/cue&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Photography is a very powerful tool to convey a message [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Because our study could utilize boots and a kettle as part of the reminders, we used individual photographs with those objects. The photograph enables participants to understand the recommended behaviours. The combination of gestures, emotions, attitudes and facial expressions of participants in the photography allows participants to become directly engaged with the intervention. Devising individual photographs into a calendar could enhance the utility of the photographs as participants are likely to look at the calendar frequently, and feel more engaged with their photograph.</p><p>The intervention positively affected wearing boots and boiling water before drinking; however, a proportion of participants did not adopt the recommended behaviours. We found that the intervention could not remove all barriers. For example, over-the-knee boots could be used in flooded rice fields without causing difficulty in walking, but were still uncomfortable in hot weather. The BCTs &#x02018;social support&#x02019; (including asking nurses, doctors, health volunteers, and families to encourage the person to continue with the recommended behaviours), and the BCT &#x02018;credible source&#x02019; (including a high status professional in the government giving a speech emphasizing the importance of melioidosis prevention) in our small study had limited efficacy. This is because, during the follow-up, a number of participants who did not adopt the recommended behaviours did not believe in the &#x02018;information of health consequence&#x02019; and noted that if the burden and mortality of melioidosis was real why had they never seen any information or campaign from the government via mass media, particularly on television.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. First, we showed that the intervention can lead to adopting recommended preventive behaviours in diabetic patients, who are a key target population for melioidosis prevention in Thailand [<xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006765.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Second, the positive effect of the visual tool (a calendar with an individual photograph) to support the behaviour change is an innovation. In this study, the activity of making calendar as a reminder tool implements a number of BCTs; including prompts/cues, credible source, instruction on how to perform a behaviour, demonstration of the behaviour, identification of self as role model, goal setting, commitment and social support (<xref rid="pntd.0006765.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although our study was not designed to evaluate efficacy of each BCT related to this activity, based on our interviews with participants during the home visits, most participants appeared to highly appreciate their own photography on the calendars. Due to strong positive feedback on this component of the intervention, further research should be conducted to evaluate the feasibility and utility of making a calendar with an individual photograph as a reminder tool for other behaviour changes across a range of settings.</p><p>The major limitation of this study is that long-term behaviour changes could not be measured and that the follow-ups may be part of the intervention as well as a method of evaluation as they could act as a reminder. Cost-efficacy analysis could not accurately be estimated from this feasibility study but is being evaluated in a subsequent large trial. Also, the programme may not be equally effective for all ages and socioeconomic groupings in the diabetic population in the whole country and beyond. It is possible that some barriers and cultures vary, and that the intervention strategies would need to be adjusted based on local context. Because the reliability of self-report cannot be assumed, we combined it with observation. Our interviews were done together with multiple home visits, during which we observed the boots and kettles that they said they regularly used. It is still possible that some participants may not report accurately, and further evaluating methods such as interviewing relatives and neighbours, and visits to rice fields without notice (but with prior consents from the participants) could be used in the future.</p><p>We recommend that health care providers together with policy makers in melioidosis-endemic areas should consider implementating multifaceted interventions for melioidosis prevention. Policy makers, health care providers and researchers should develop a working group to evaluate the feasibility of the interventions, adjust components of the interventions based on their own local context, and gradually implement the interventions. Policy makers should also focus on delivering disease education, particularly through mass media and implementing the multifaceted interventions through healthcare providers. Researchers should also evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the interventions which are gradually implemented.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we evaluated the multifaceted prevention programme of melioidosis and found that the programme is feasible and could lead to adopting recommended preventive behaviours. We strongly suggest that commitment and action by the government are essential for the preventive programmes to occur and be successful. Making calendars with individual photographs and self-pledges as a reminder tool could be powerful in behaviour change interventions, and further research on this component is needed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jirawat Nareerat, Santipong Gropthong, Jiraporn Mungmai, Chompunoot Suwannasala and Boodsayakorn Malai for their technical assiatance.
