Powerful and variable tools using TALENs can be used in practical applications and may facilitate the molecular breeding of many plant species. We have developed a convenient construction system for a plant TALEN vector named the Emerald Gateway TALEN system. In this study, we added new properties to this system, which led to an increase in the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis. Rice dMac3 is a translational enhancer that highly increases the efficiency of translation of the downstream ORF. We inserted dMac3 into the 5' untranslated region of the TALEN gene. In the cultured rice cells to which the TALEN gene was introduced, the frequency of targeted mutagenesis was highly increased compared with those altered using the conventional system. Next, the promoter for the TALEN gene was replaced with iPromoter, and its expression was stringently controlled by a GVG transcription factor that was activated in the presence of glucocorticoid. This conditional expression system worked effectively and led to a higher frequency of targeted mutagenesis than that by the constitutive expression system, while no mutagenesis was detected without glucocorticoid treatment. These results suggest that our system can be applied to genome editing to create the desired mutation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9304-3293</contrib-id><name><surname>Shimada</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was partly supported by a grant from the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) to HS and by a grant within the scope of Bayer Crop Science&#x02019;s initiative "Grants4Traits - Novel solutions to increase crop productivity" to HS.

To obtain the desired mutant, a powerful and user-friendly system that is applicable for many species is needed.</p><p>In the case of CRISPR/Cas9, the CRISPR RNA directs Cas9 to introduce double-stranded breaks in target DNA [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The targeting specificity of Cas9 is regulated by the 20-nt guiding sequence of a single guide RNA and the presence of a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) adjacent to the target sequence in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the high frequency of off-target activity creates mutations at sites other than the intended on-target site [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, off-target problems are low in the TALEN system. TALEN is composed of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) fused to the catalytic domains of the <italic>FokI</italic> endonuclease and causes double-strand breaks only upon dimerization of the <italic>FokI</italic> domains [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The methods for the targeted mutagenesis of plant genomes using TALENs have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In general, TALEN consists of 18 repetitions of 34 amino acids in which the 12th and 13th residues determine DNA binding specificity and are called the "repeatable variable di-residues" (RVD) [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The TALEN pair must bind to opposite strands split by a "spacer" consisting of 14 to 20 bases at the target site. For <italic>FokI</italic> to be active, it must form a dimer, so this offset design is required [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The degeneracy of the RVD-DNA binding code may be observed [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, TALEN rarely induces an off-target reaction because of DNA cleavage at the target site with high sequence specificity [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of some mRNAs is known to function as an enhancer of translation, largely increasing the production of the protein encoded by the downstream ORF [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We have found long 5'UTRs that show strong translational enhancer activity in the rice genes <italic>OsMac1</italic>, <italic>OsMac2</italic>, and <italic>OsMac3</italic>. They lead to 10-fold or higher efficiency of translation of the downstream ORFs. Among them, the 5'UTR of <italic>OsMac3</italic> mRNA was shown to be a strong translational enhancer that significantly promotes the translational efficiency of the downstream ORF [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We have established a simple TALEN construction system, named the Emerald Gateway TALEN system, which employs Gateway-assisted plasmid construction to produce the desired TALEN genes [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we attempted to increase the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis by applying the enhancer activity of the 5'UTR of <italic>OsMac3</italic> to our TALEN construction system.</p><p>For plant genome editing, artificial nucleases ubiquitously expressed in plant cells are generally used [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it has been shown that the constitutive CaMV-35S promoter causes a mosaic effect with a high mutation rate [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, to avoid such a harmful event, it is desired that any activities of the artificial nucleases are diminished after finishing the genome-editing event.</p><p>For this purpose, we attempted to construct an artificial nuclease gene that showed conditional expression under an inducible promoter. Aoyama and Chua have reported an inducible promoter system consisting of two components containing the gene for the transcription factor GVG and the specialized promoter that responds to the activated GVG protein [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. GVG is a chimeric transcription factor consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, the trans-activating domain of the herpes viral protein VP16, and the receptor domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is activated by the addition of glucocorticoid [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we applied this system to our TALEN construction system. We expected that the resultant system would be controlled stringently by the addition of glucocorticoid.</p><p>Here, we report the construction of novel TALEN vector systems that enhance the efficiency of target mutagenesis, and we show the results of an evaluation of the mutagenesis using TALENs with the chemically controlled promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials and culture conditions</title><p>For the rice cultured cells, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. cv.

Here, we propose a new strategy enabling high-efficiency targeted mutagenesis.</p><p>dMac3 shows translation enhancer activity that efficiently increases the amount of protein generated from the downstream ORF [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, we reported that dMac3 employed in conjunction with the Cas9 gene of a CRISPR/Cas9 vector system may allow increases in the frequency of targeted mutagenesis in potato cells [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is expected that TALEN genes employing dMac3 would produce a large number of the TALEN molecules in the cells when dMac3 was set preceding the ORFs for TALENs. We expected that cleavage of the target site would occur very frequently in this cell, and consequently, the efficiency of targeted mutagenesis would increase. In this study, we constructed two types of conventional TALEN construction systems, the Emerald Gateway dx-TALEN system and Emerald Gateway dx-TALEN premium system, which enabled the creation of a pair of TALEN genes corresponding to an appropriate region of the target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Using these systems, the generation of a large number of the TALEN molecules is expected in the cells with ubiquitous and inducible expression.</p><p>Using Emerald Gateway dx-TALEN system, we determined the effect of dMac3 on genome editing. We constructed TALEN genes that targeted the sequences in the <italic>Os01g0833500</italic> gene where there was a <italic>Kpn</italic>I cleavage site. We analyzed targeted mutation at this site by CAPS analysis as the disappearance of <italic>Kpn</italic>I cleavage and determined the efficiency of mutagenesis by the presence or absence of dMac3. The frequency of mutagenesis was greatly increased when the TALENs with dMac3 were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This suggests that dMac3 is an effective tool for the induced mutation by TALENs.</p><p>To reduce the potential toxic effects of genome editing reagents, the activity of these reagents needs to be controlled by incorporating regulatory switches that can reduce off-target activities and/or allow for these reagents to be turned on or off [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We expected that the artificial nucleases could work in the desired organs with specificity in a temporal manner. iPromoter is a strong promoter stringently controlled by the GVG transcription factor, which is activated in the presence of glucocorticoid [<xref rid="pone.0208959.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To make TALENs controlled by the inducible promoter, we created a TALEN construction system employing the dMac3 translational enhancer with iPromoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p><p>TALENs corresponding to the <italic>Os01g0833500</italic> gene were constructed, and the efficiency of mutation in the cultured cells was analyzed. Mutations were specifically and frequently detected in the glucocorticoid-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These mutant cells contained nucleotide deletions, insertions, and rearrangements in the region targeted by the TALENs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These results suggested that this system allowed targeted mutagenesis to occur dependent on induction by glucocorticoid treatment. However, no two-allele mutation was found in the cells treated by the TALENs with iPromoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g004">Fig 4</xref>), whereas a large number of two-allele mutants were detected in the callus by the TALENs with dMac3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208959.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In this study, glucocorticoid was applied to the transformant callus for 5 days. We presume that the period of glucocorticoid treatment was too short to induce the targeted mutation in both of two alleles. The fact that mutation occurred in more than 60% calli implies that this system effectively works for the targeted mutagenesis. Our system may facilitate the creation of appropriate TALEN genes that target arbitrary sequences and may be a powerful tool for genome editing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TALEN is an artificial nuclease that causes DNA cleavage at the target site and induces few off-target reactions. We added new properties to the TALEN construction system. We inserted dMac3, a translational enhancer highly increasing the efficiency of translation of the downstream ORF, into the 5' untranslated region of the TALEN gene. In the cultured rice cells to which the TALEN gene was introduced, the frequency of targeted mutagenesis was highly increased. Next, the promoter for the TALEN gene was replaced with an inducible promoter, iPromoter. Its expression was stringently controlled by a GVG transcription factor that was activated in the presence of glucocorticoid. This conditional expression system worked effectively and led to a higher frequency of targeted mutagenesis, while no mutagenesis was detected without glucocorticoid treatment. These results suggest that our system can be applied to genome editing to create the desired mutation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208959.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Table A.
