    "BACKGROUND:The DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are associated with the cis-regulatory DNA elements. An efficient method of identifying DHSs can enhance the understanding on the accessibility of chromatin. Despite a multitude of resources available on line including experimental datasets and computational tools, the complex language of DHSs remains incompletely understood. METHODS:Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a state-of-the-art machine learning method. We present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) which combined Inception like networks with a gating mechanism for the response of multiple patterns and longterm association in DNA sequences to predict multi-scale DHSs in Arabidopsis, rice and Homo sapiens. RESULTS:Our method obtains 0.961 area under curve (AUC) on Arabidopsis, 0.969 AUC on rice and 0.918 AUC on Homo sapiens. CONCLUSIONS:Our method provides an efficient and accurate way to identify multi-scale DHSs sequences by deep learning."
