Therefore, the safety and quality of raw tea leaves are important indices for making tea and related products. Habitat management has been widely used as an environmentally friendly method to control pests in agroecosystems. To investigate the impact of habitat management on tea plantation ecosystems, a habitat management approach with intercropping was established. The function of habitat management on pest control was evaluated. Furthermore, metabolome and transcriptome analysis were applied to assay changes in quality-related metabolites. The habitat management approach was found to maintain arthropod biodiversity and develop natural arthropod enemies in the tea plantation. Therefore, the yield of the habitat management-treated tea plantation was increased. Metabolome analysis showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the major catechin in tea leaves, has a significantly increased content in leaves of tea plants under habitat management compared with those in the control tea plantation. The content of L-theanine, the major amino acid in tea leaves, was not significantly changed in tea plants under habitat management. Furthermore, aroma compounds were more abundant in tea leaves from the habitat management-treated tea plantation than those from the chemical pesticide-treated tea plantation. Therefore, habitat management is reported for the first time as a safe and effective approach to improving the yield and quality of tea leaves.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31600559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong 2015A030313563 President Foundation of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences 201630</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences Y821131001 Pearl River Science and Technology New Star Fund of Guangzhou 201806010018</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong 2016A030313773</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Academic Team Construction Projects of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences 201627TD</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.) O. Kuntze) is an important commercial crop consumed worldwide, primarily as a beverage made from processed leaves. Tea pest control is the major challenge in tea plantation management. Globally, 1,034 arthropod species occur in tea plantations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 3% of these arthropods are common pests, such as <italic>Ectropis obliqua</italic>, <italic>Empoasca onukii</italic>, and <italic>Euproctis pseudoconspersa</italic>, throughout the major tea-producing regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Outbreaks of these pests account for serious yield losses and quality reduction. Various pest control methods, such as chemical pesticides, sex pheromones, and entomopathogenic insect pesticides, have been applied globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Among these, the use of chemical pesticides is the predominant method used by farmers to control tea pests. However, excessive pesticide use to prevent and control pests pollutes the environment, resulting in ecological damage and reduced biodiversity. Pesticide residues also negatively affect food safety and result in health risks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Other environmentally friendly pest control technologies, such as biological pesticides and sex pheromones, have some application limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, new green, recyclable, and low-carbon-emission methods for the prevention and control of tea plantation pests are required.</p><p id="Par3">In recent years, habitat management strategies have been applied and shown to be effective at controlling pests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Habitat management involves intervening in the vegetation of an agroecosystem with the intention to suppress pest densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The rational distribution of crops makes it possible to increase the biological diversity of agroecosystems in time and space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which facilitates the control of crop pests by the agroecosystem itself. Habitat management has been successfully applied to field pest control in rice, which is the major food crop of Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Habitat management and improved biodiversity can change the environment in an agroecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Plant metabolites can be altered through environmental adaption. Aroma compounds, amino acids, and polyphenols are the key taste and flavour-related metabolites that influence tea quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These metabolites can be changed by insect attacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, shading treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, light quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Tea plants are perennial evergreen shrubs that can easily form a more stable and functional ecosystem. Therefore, habitat management may effectively control pests in tea plantations. However, the effect of habitat management on tea quality remains unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of habitat management on tea pest control and tea leaf quality. In addition to providing pest control, habitat management was proven to be a safe and effective method for improving tea quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effect of habitat management on tea plantation yield</title><p id="Par5">Tea yield is the key factor impacting the economic value of a tea plantation.

In the present study, habitat management was found to be effective at maintaining tea plantation yields. Intercropping on the HM tea plantation might be responsible for the improved yield. Shading, which was provided by intercropping on the tea plantation, is beneficial to tea plant growth and improves tea plantation yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

The complex landscape was expected to enhance natural pest control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As the landscape of the HM tea plantation was more suitable for natural enemy population growth, these natural enemies could effectively suppress pest populations. Neutral insects are also important in agroecosystems, providing food for natural enemies during crop early growth stages and benefitting natural enemy development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

In the present study, habitat management was effective in forming a healthy ecosystem and providing ecological balance on the tea plantation. The fluctuating levels of arthropod diversity and richness after spring tea picking and during winter on the CP tea plantation suggested that this ecosystem was delicate. CP usage disrupted the balance between pests and natural enemies, which might have caused the resurgence in pests induced by pesticide resistance.</p><p id="Par19">Another critical problem of CP application is pesticide residue. CP residue is a critical factor that impacts the safety of tea products. The use of CPs for pest control left pesticide residues on tea products. Presently, increased attention is being paid to food safety. Tea product safety was negatively affected by frequent CP use. Owing to health risks, strict management of CPs and residue monitoring have been implemented in most countries. Although CP application prevents yield losses caused by pests in the short-term, their residues are problematic to tea safety long-term. The results of this study suggest that habitat management can effectively replace CP usage to maintain tea plantation yields.</p><p id="Par20">Yield and safety are just two of the indices used to evaluate the function of habitat management. Another factor closely related to the economic value of tea is tea quality. Metabolites are the foundation of tea quality, providing the basis for evaluating the nutritional and economic values of tea. Our study showed that different planting management strategies mediated gene expression and changed the metabolic profiles. Some tea quality indicators were improved under HM treatment.</p><p id="Par21">L-Theanine and catechins are the major taste and health-related components in tea, and are the major components of the index used to evaluating tea functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. L-Theanine gives tea its distinctive umami taste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and can also induce a relaxed state, lower blood pressure, and improve learning abilities in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The functions of catechins in vascular homeostasis, atherogenesis reduction, and cardiovascular disease prevention have also been well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. EGCG is the major catechin in tea leaves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Higher EGCG and normal L-theanine contents in tea leaves from the HM tea plantation suggested that they could have increased contents of human health-related chemicals.</p><p id="Par22">Terpenoids contribute to the floral and fruity aromas of tea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Tea leaves with higher terpenoid levels have an increased flavour level. The expression of terpenoids synthases gene may be stimulated when the plant is under insect attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Higher terpenoid levels in the tea leaves from CK and HM tea plantations, which had higher pest populations than the CP plantation, were hypothesized to result from biostress induced by these pests. Furthermore, in agreement with our speculation, the jasmonate level was lowest in tea leaves from the CP tea plantation (data not shown). Although CP application allowed the tea plantation to maintain a high yield, the flavour of the tea leaves was significantly impacted, which reduced tea quality.</p><p id="Par23">In most crops, habitat management has been applied to safely control pests and maintain yield levels. Limited research has focused on the impact of habitat management on crop quality. Herein, habitat management effectively controlled pests by maintaining arthropod biodiversity and developing natural enemies on the tea plantation. Furthermore, intercropping and natural pest control, as aspects of habitat management, increased the yield. An analysis of metabolites showed that, compared with the CK tea plantation, the levels of some catechins, including EGCG, were significantly increased on the HM tea plantation. Additionally, owing to plant responses to biostress and a larger arthropod community on the HM tea plantation, aroma compounds were more abundant in tea leaves from the HM tea plantation than in those from the CP tea plantation. Therefore, the tea quality appeared to be better on the HM tea plantation than on the CP tea plantation. Accordingly, considering yield, safety, and quality, habitat management was the best approach for operating a tea plantation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).
