    "The U-box gene family is a family of genes which encode U-box domain-containing proteins. However, little is known about U-box genes in banana (Musa acuminata). In this study, 91 U-box genes were identified in banana based on its genome sequence. The banana U-box genes were distributed across all 12 chromosomes at different densities. Phylogenetic analysis of U-box genes from banana, Arabidopsis, and rice suggested that they can be clustered into seven subgroups (I⁻VII), and most U-box genes had a closer relationship between banana and rice relative to Arabidopsis. Typical U-box domains were found in all identified MaU-box genes through the analysis of conserved motifs. Four conserved domains were found in major banana U-box proteins. The MaU-box gene family had the highest expression in the roots at the initial fruit developmental stage. The MaU-box genes exhibited stronger response to drought than to salt and low temperatures. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to perform genome-wide identification and analysis of the U-box gene family in banana, and the results should provide valuable information for better understanding of the function of U-box in banana."
