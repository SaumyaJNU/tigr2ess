Thus far only octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modified gelatinised starch has been known to adsorb at emulsion droplet interfaces, acting as emulsifiers. Screening a range of commercially available food starches revealed that a non-waxy rice starch, a waxy rice starch and the waxy maize starch PRIMA600 showed oil-in-water emulsifying ability following gelatinisation. The microstructure of emulsions formulated with 20% oil and 1% starch was stable for at least 3 months. Thermal, crystallinity and molecular property analyses as well as amylose and protein content revealed no obvious link to this property. Nevertheless, this research has provided the food industry with exciting results for the formulation of clean label emulsions. Moreover, it presents a concept for oral release food emulsions with destabilisation via salivary amylase digestion of the stabilising starch emulsifier.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Non-chemically modified gelatinised starches screened for emulsifier functionality.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">High shear overhead processing of oil-in-water emulsions.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">A waxy &#x00026; non-waxy rice &#x00026; waxy maize starch adsorbed at oil droplets, others did not.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Not related to thermal, crystallinity &#x00026; molecular properties, amylose, protein.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Functionality as clean label emulsifier clearly demonstrated.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Non-chemically modified gelatinised starch</kwd><kwd>OSA starch</kwd><kwd>Emulsion</kwd><kwd>Stability</kwd><kwd>Sedimentation coefficient</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Emulsions are a frequently encountered microstructure in processed consumer goods including foods, paints and cosmetics. They are two-phase liquid dispersions where one phase is present in the form of droplets in another immiscible phase. With the exception of microemulsions they are thermodynamically unstable. Therefore, in practice emulsion microstructures are kinetically trapped through the use of emulsifiers and often also the addition of viscosity enhancers to the continuous emulsion phase. Emulsifiers adsorb at the interface between the two immiscible liquid phases imparting electrostatic or steric barriers between neighbouring and colliding droplets thus preventing coalescence. Adsorption occurs during processing, trapping process induced microstructures if the concentration of added emulsifier is high enough compared to the total interfacial area of the emulsion. Otherwise, coalescence will occur until surface saturation traps the evolving microstructure. Viscosifiers aide the prevention of coalescence by slowing the creaming or sedimentation of individual droplets thus close proximity of droplets which may lead to coalescence.</p><p id="p0040">The research reported here is concerned with emulsifiers suitable to stabilise oil-in-water (o/w) food emulsion interfaces during processing, imparting microstructure stability over storage, but destabilising the emulsion microstructure during oral processing to release in the oil phase entrapped salt or sugar solution. The microstructure of such systems is known as water-in-oil-in-water emulsions generally referred to as multiple, duplex or complex emulsions. The release of the tastant solution from the internal water phase to the vicinity of the taste receptors will impart a higher perceived tastant intensity compared to an emulsion where all of the tastant is present in the external emulsion phase, which we have reported for the case of saltiness enhancement (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chiu, Hewson, Fisk, &#x00026; Wolf, 2015</xref>). The emulsifier was commercial octinyl succinic anhydride (OSA) waxy maize starch destabilising the emulsion during oral processing due to the mechanical actions of tongue and teeth combined with the enzymatic breakdown through salivary amylase. Also applied for emulsion stabilisation have been OSA modified native starch granules (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Timgren, Rayner, Sj&#x000f6;&#x000f6; &#x00026; Dejmek, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Rayner, Timgren, Sjoo &#x00026; Dejmek, 2012</xref>). Preparing our own gelatinised OSA modified waxy maize starch with a degree of modification between 0% and 3%, corresponding to the upper level allowed for OSA modified starch as a food ingredient, we were able to demonstrate that the degree of OSA modification was negatively correlated to tastant perception (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chiu, Tarrega, Parmenter, Hewson, Wolf &#x00026; Fisk, 2017</xref>). However, at less than 2% OSA modification the microstructure of the emulsions was stable only for up to a few days, rendering this approach to reduce salt or sugar in emulsion-based foods commercially almost irrelevant.</p><p id="p0045">Clearly, native starch with no sites of the molecule rendered inaccessible to amylase would provide the fastest digestion kinetics (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">He, Liu &#x00026; Zhang, 2008</xref>). It is therefore hypothesised to provide best results in terms of taste enhancement. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no literature reports of non-chemically modified gelatinised starch acting as stabilisers of o/w interfaces. There are though literature reports of unmodified native starch granules providing emulsion stability (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Li, Li, Sun &#x00026; Yang, 2013</xref>), although to a limited degree. Nevertheless, we revisited this approach. Since, as with any particles applied for interfacial stabilisation of emulsions, smaller starch granules will stabilise smaller droplets, we selected rice starch. More specifically, we selected waxy rice starch to minimise the complexity of the system as the starch component of waxy starches is composed of nearly 100% amylopectin, and not a mixture of amylose and amylopectin. Following our previous experimental protocols, we prepared water-in-oil-in-water emulsions through high shear processing in absence of temperature control. The emulsions were stable against coalescence for several weeks while the granular nature of the waxy rice starch had been lost. This was confirmed by inspecting the droplet surfaces for starch granules with bright field and cross-polarised illumination microscopy. It appeared that the emulsions were stabilised by gelatinised waxy rice starch leading to question whether other commonly applied food starches would show the same functionality. This was investigated in the research reported here utilising starches varying in botanical origin including waxy and non-waxy varieties. A commercial OSA starch was included as control and all of the starches were submitted to a simple oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion assay. Irrespective of whether stable emulsions were formed the starches were extensively characterised to develop an understanding of why (some) non-chemically modified gelatinised starches may stabilise o/w emulsion interfaces. This is of considerable practical interest because native starches are clean label ingredients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Starches</title><p id="p0050"><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> provides an overview of the starches tested in this research for their ability to stabilise o/w emulsion interfaces.

As described in the methods section preparation of the waxy rice starch for this measurement included high temperature processing as in the case of emulsion processing followed by cooling to room temperature (approx. 20&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C). It was validated that this starch dispersion would stabilise o/w emulsions through high shear processing at 20&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C before interfacial tension measurement at 20&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C. In the absence of any starch interfacial tension asymptotically reached a value of 26.5&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.4&#x0202f;mN/m after a slightly decreasing trend for the first 120&#x0202f;s due to the presence of naturally present surface-active molecules in sunflower oil. The data traces overlapped with the data traces acquired in presence of gelatinised waxy rice starch in the aqueous phase; in this case the averaged value after levelling off was 26.8&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;1.3&#x0202f;mN/m. However, in presence of OSA starch in the aqueous phase, following an initial longer decrease, the interfacial tension levelled off at 18.2&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;0.1&#x0202f;mN/m. OSA starch has been created to be interfacially active and a decrease in interfacial tension was expected. However, it appears that gelatinised waxy rice starch did not adsorb at the interface during the interfacial tension analysis leading to the conclusion that it is not interfacially active. As this starch was still stabilising o/w emulsions it was hypothesised that, during high shear processing, molecules or molecular aggregates of starch would contact the o/w interface and then adhere to it imparting the observed emulsion stability. The presence of starch at the o/w interface was validated by confocal laser scanning microscopy; see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>. The red domains in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref> indicate starch-rich regions and these are clearly located at the droplet interfaces. Protein was not visible in these micrographs which is not surprising given the low amount of protein in any of these starches (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).<fig id="fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Confocal laser scanning micrograph of an o/w emulsion stabilised with 4% non-waxy rice starch, waxy maize PRIMA600, waxy rice and OSA starch.

Amylose-lipid complexes can be naturally present in native starches (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 1986</xref>) and form during gelatinisation in the presence of lipids. In their unordered form, amylose-inclusion complexes are known as &#x0201c;type I&#x0201d; complexes while the amorphous complexes, organized in lamellae, are referred to as &#x0201c;type II&#x0201d; amylose-inclusion complexes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Putseys, Lamberts &#x00026; Delcour, 2010</xref>).

The greatest intensity was shown by the high amylose maize starch (Hylon VII). The V-pattern intensity was greater for the non-waxy rice starch compared to the waxy rice starch due to the comparatively higher amount of amylose in the non-waxy variety. Similarly, in the case of the waxy maize starch PRIMA600 and AMIOCA TF, the intensity of the V-pattern was diminished. So, as expected, the XRD patterns reflect the level of amylose in the starches which was already suggested to not be indicative of their emulsifying ability. However, the question whether amylose-lipid complexes do form in these systems during processing and therefore contribute to emulsion stability requires further analysis, e.g. based on nuclear magnetic resonance (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beeren, Meier &#x00026; Hindsgaul, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>XRD pattern of (a) high amylose maize starch (Hylon VII), (b) non-waxy rice starch, (c) pea starch, (d) potato starch, (e) regular rice starch, (f) tapioca starch, (g) waxy maize starch AMIOCA TF, (h) waxy maize starch PRIMA600, (i) waxy rice starch and(j) wheat starch.

The high amylose maize starch Hylon VII, the potato starch and the regular rice starch, all three not showing emulsifying functionality, had narrower sedimentation coefficient distributions at the lower end of the Svedberg unit range (&#x0003c;&#x0223c;200&#x0202f;S), typically with fewer peaks. The pea starch, also not emulsifying, had a high peak in the lower Svedberg unit domain with a broad low intensity population covering the Svedberg unit range up to 500&#x0202f;S with a small number of peaks that were not isolated from each other. The wheat starch, again not emulsifying, showed a similar pattern although with a larger number of isolated peaks or populations in the mid to high Svedberg unit domain. The sedimentation coefficient distribution of the tapioca starch, which stabilised the o/w emulsion processed in this study when applied at 4%, appeared similar to that of pea starch but with larger populations at the higher Svedberg unit domain.</p><p id="p0200">Since it was already known which starches showed emulsifying ability the sedimentation coefficient distribution data were assessed if a certain fraction of starch polymers or polymer aggregates at the higher size (sedimentation coefficient, in Svedbergs) range was required for starches to show this functionality.

This ability to act as emulsifier through interfacial adsorption during processing was not related to amylose content or crystallinity pattern. Characterising the molecular characteristics of the starches and the fraction that remained in the emulsion serum phase with the method of analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) also failed to increase understanding of criteria for emulsifying ability. Nevertheless, this research has, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time shown that waxy rice starch, non-waxy rice starch and waxy maize starch PRIMA600 act as emulsifiers. So, there are natural or clean label starches, not only alternative to OSA starch but also to other synthetic food emulsifiers, that can be applied for the interfacial stabilisation of emulsion based foods.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>F.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>P.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Doublier</surname><given-names>J.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Durand</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Buleon</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physico-chemical characterisation of sago starch</article-title><source>Carbohydrate Polymers</source><volume>38</volume><issue>4</issue><year>1999</year><fpage>361</fpage><lpage>370</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib23"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref23"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>AOAC</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Microchemical determination of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, automated method</chapter-title><comment>Official Method 972.43</comment><source>Official methods of analysis of AOAC international</source><edition>17th ed.</edition><year>2000</year><comment>Gaithersburg</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Banks</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Geddes</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Greenwood</surname><given-names>C.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>I.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physico-chemical studies on starches</article-title><source>Starch Starke</source><volume>24</volume><year>1972</year><fpage>245</fpage><lpage>251</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beeren</surname><given-names>S.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Meier</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hindsgaul</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Probing helical hydrophobic binding sites in branched starch polysaccharides using NMR spectroscopy</article-title><source>Chemistry</source><volume>19</volume><issue>48</issue><year>2013</year><fpage>16314</fpage><lpage>16320</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24123516</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hewson</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisk</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Programmed emulsions for sodium reduction in emulsion based foods</article-title><source>Food &#x00026; Function</source><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><year>2015</year><fpage>1428</fpage><lpage>1434</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25865459</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarrega</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Parmenter</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hewson</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisk</surname><given-names>I.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Optimisation of octinyl succinic anhydride starch stabilised w(1)/o/w(2) emulsions for oral destabilisation of encapsulated salt and enhanced saltiness</article-title><source>Food Hydrocolloids</source><volume>69</volume><year>2017</year><fpage>450</fpage><lpage>458</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28775392</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Colonna</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Doublier</surname><given-names>J.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Melcion</surname><given-names>J.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Demonredon</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mercier</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Extrusion cooking and drum drying of wheat-starch. 1.
