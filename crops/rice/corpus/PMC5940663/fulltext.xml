We assessed exposure before and during weaning and investigated the association between solid food intake and infants&#x02019; urinary arsenic species concentrations. Following the recording of a comprehensive 3 day food diary, paired urine samples (pre- and post-weaning) were collected and analyzed for arsenic speciation from 15 infants participating in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Infants had higher urinary i-As (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), and sum of arsenic species (i-As&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;DMA, <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) during weaning than while exclusively fed on a liquid diet (i.e., breast milk, formula, or a mixture of both).

A growing body of evidence points to the heightened vulnerability of infants to lifelong health impacts of i-As, and, thus early life i-As dietary exposure is an increasingly recognized public health concern even for populations with access to drinking water with low arsenic concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

Despite the fact that infants consumed neither fish nor seafood in the 3 days prior to the urine sample collection, traces of AsB were observed in their urine with no changes before and after weaning, which suggests that breast milk and formula may contribute to that exposure.

Concerns regarding i-As content in rice destined for the production of food for infants and young children have already led to an &#x0201c;action level&#x0201d; of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/kg of i-As in infant rice cereals proposed by the U.S. FDA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, paralleling the maximum level established by law in the E.U.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Daily urine samples collection would have been ideal; however, that was not possible given what is involved in obtaining an adequate infant urine sample. Additionally, direct dietary exposure to DMA and MMA was not assessed in this study, and thus as mentioned weaning infants&#x02019; increased urinary sum of arsenic species compared to their urinary sum of arsenic species when consuming only liquids may not exclusively reflect exposure to dietary i-As.
