    "Heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) play key roles in responses to various abiotic stress responses and tolerance in plants. However, the detailed mechanisms behind these roles remain unclear. Mulberry (Morus alba L.) can adapt to adverse abiotic stress conditions; however, little is known regarding the associated molecular mechanisms. In this study, mulberry G-protein genes, MaGα, MaGβ, MaGγ1, and MaGγ2, were independently transformed into tobacco, and the transgenic plants were used for resistance identification experiments. The ectopic expression of MaGα in tobacco decreased the tolerance to drought and salt stresses, while the overexpression of MaGβ, MaGγ1, and MaGγ2 increased the tolerance. Further analysis showed that mulberry G-proteins may regulate drought and salt tolerances by modulating reactive oxygen species' detoxification. This study revealed the roles of each mulberry G-protein subunit in abiotic stress tolerance and advances our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying G-proteins' regulation of plant abiotic stress tolerance."
