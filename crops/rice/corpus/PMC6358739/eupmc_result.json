    "Abiotic and biotic stresses are the main reasons of substantial crop yield losses worldwide. Research devoted to reveal mechanisms of plant reactions during their interactions with the environment are conducted on the level of genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. Data obtained during these studies would permit to define biochemical and physiological mechanisms of plant resistance or susceptibility to affecting factors/stresses. Metabolomics based on mass spectrometric techniques is an important part of research conducted in the direction of breeding new varieties of crop plants tolerant to the affecting stresses and possessing good agronomical features. Studies of this kind are carried out on model, crop and resurrection plants. Metabolites profiling yields large sets of data and due to this fact numerous advanced statistical and bioinformatic methods permitting to obtain qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the results have been developed. Moreover, advanced integration of metabolomics data with these obtained on other omics levels: genome, transcriptome and proteome should be carried out. Such a holistic approach would bring us closer to understanding biochemical and physiological processes of the cell and whole plant interacting with the environment and further apply these observations in successful breeding of stress tolerant or resistant crop plants."
