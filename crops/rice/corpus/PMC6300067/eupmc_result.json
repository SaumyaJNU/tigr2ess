    "Plant organ shape is determined by the spatial-temporal expression of genes that control the direction and rate of cell division and expansion, as well as the mechanical constraints provided by the rigid cell walls and surrounding cells. Despite the importance of organ morphology during the plant life cycle, the interplay of patterning genes with these mechanical constraints and the cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Shapes of harvestable plant organs such as fruits, leaves, seeds and tubers vary dramatically among, and within crop plants. Years of selection have led to the accumulation of mutations in genes regulating organ shapes, allowing us to identify new genetic and molecular components controlling morphology as well as the interactions among the proteins. Using tomato as a model, we discuss the interaction of Ovate Family Proteins (OFPs) with a subset of TONNEAU1-recruiting motif family of proteins (TRMs) as a part of the protein network that appears to be required for interactions with the microtubules leading to coordinated multicellular growth in plants. In addition, SUN and other members of the IQD family also exert their effects on organ shape by interacting with microtubules. In this review, we aim to illuminate the probable mechanistic aspects of organ growth mediated by OFP-TRM and SUN/IQD via their interactions with the cytoskeleton."
