    "Agricultural weeds serve as productive models for studying the genetic basis of rapid adaptation, with weed-adaptive traits potentially evolving multiple times independently in geographically distinct but environmentally similar agroecosystems. Weedy relatives of domesticated crops can be especially interesting systems because of the potential for weed-adaptive alleles to originate through multiple mechanisms, including introgression from cultivated and/or wild relatives, standing genetic variation, and de novo mutations. Weedy rice populations have evolved multiple times through dedomestication from cultivated rice. Much of the genomic work to date in weedy rice has focused on populations that exist outside the range of the wild crop progenitor. In this study, we use genome-wide SNPs generated through genotyping-by-sequencing to compare the evolution of weedy rice in regions outside the range of wild rice (North America, South Korea) and populations in Southeast Asia, where wild rice populations are present. We find evidence for adaptive introgression of wild rice alleles into weedy rice populations in Southeast Asia, with the relative contributions of wild and cultivated rice alleles varying across the genome. In addition, gene regions underlying several weed-adaptive traits are dominated by genomic contributions from wild rice. Genome-wide nucleotide diversity is also much higher in Southeast Asian weeds than in North American and South Korean weeds. Besides reflecting introgression from wild rice, this difference in diversity likely reflects genetic contributions from diverse cultivated landraces that may have served as the progenitors of these weedy populations. These important differences in weedy rice evolution in regions with and without wild rice could inform region-specific management strategies for weed control."
