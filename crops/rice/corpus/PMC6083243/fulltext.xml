Given the nearby presence of non-<italic>Bt</italic> crops (including those planted as refuges) and non-crop habitats, pests targeted by the <italic>Bt</italic> trait have a choice between <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> crops or weeds, and their host preference may greatly affect insect management and management of pest resistance to <italic>Bt</italic> proteins. In this study, we examined the oviposition preference of the target pest of <italic>Bt</italic> rice, <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic>, for <italic>Bt</italic> versus non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants as influenced by previous damage caused by <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> larvae. The results showed that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females had no oviposition preference for undamaged <italic>Bt</italic> or non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants but were repelled by conspecific-damaged plants whether <italic>Bt</italic> or non-<italic>Bt</italic>. Consequently, <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> egg masses were more numerous on <italic>Bt</italic> plants than on neighbouring non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants both in greenhouse and in field experiments due to the significantly greater caterpillar damage on non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants. We also found evidence of poorer performance of <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> larvae on conspecific-damaged rice plants when compared with undamaged plants. GC-MS analyses showed that larval damage induced the release of volatiles that repelled mated <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females in wind tunnel experiments<italic>.</italic> These findings suggest that <italic>Bt</italic> rice could act as a dead-end trap crop for <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> and thereby protect adjacent non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants. The results also indicate that the oviposition behaviour of target pest females should be considered in the development of <italic>Bt</italic> resistance management strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Bt</italic> rice</kwd><kwd>oviposition preference</kwd><kwd>plant volatile</kwd><kwd>intraspecific relationship</kwd><kwd><italic>Bt</italic> resistance management</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July 25, 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last 20 years, insect-resistant genetically engineered plants expressing Cry proteins from the bacterium <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) have been rapidly and widely adopted worldwide. Introduced in 1996, they covered a total area of about 100 million hectares in 2016 [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In general, the adoption of <italic>Bt</italic> crops has provided efficient control of the target pest(s), reduced the application of pesticides and increased yields [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These advantages have motivated researchers in China to develop dozens of <italic>Bt</italic> lines for controlling lepidopteran pests of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.), including <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> (Crambidae), <italic>Scirpophaga incertulas</italic> (Crambidae), <italic>Sesamia inferens</italic> (Noctuidae) and <italic>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</italic> (Crambidae) [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among these, <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> is considered the most serious rice pest in China because it attacks rice at all growth stages causing an annual yield loss of 3.1% [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Although many studies have confirmed that <italic>Bt</italic> rice lines provide substantial protection against target pests [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], few studies have considered the effects of <italic>Bt</italic> rice (or <italic>Bt</italic> maize or cotton) on the oviposition behaviour of target pest females [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding the effects of <italic>Bt</italic> crops on oviposition of the target pest is important because <italic>Bt</italic> crops are generally planted with non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants. The latter serve as a refuge in that they support pest reproduction and thereby reduce the selection of genotypes with resistance to <italic>Bt</italic> [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the &#x02018;refuge-in-a-bag&#x02019; approach, <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> seeds of a crop are mixed and sown together so that the pest females will need to travel only a short distance to select a <italic>Bt</italic> or non-<italic>Bt</italic> plant for oviposition [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whether the non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants are in an adjacent field or are in the same field as the <italic>Bt</italic> plants, females of mobile target pests will have the opportunity to select between <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants for oviposition.</p><p>Most models concerning the development of <italic>Bt</italic> resistance in a target pest assume that oviposition among <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> refuge plants will be random [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. That oviposition may not be random is suggested by two different views on insect behaviour. According to one view, females tend to lay eggs on plants on which their offspring can perform well. Based on this view, researchers have suspected that, given the strong selection pressure caused by <italic>Bt</italic> plants, female moths (most targeted pests are lepidopterans) may evolve a genetically controlled oviposition preference for alternative non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A different view is based on the observation that female moths often prefer to lay eggs on undamaged rather than on insect-damaged host plants in order to reduce potential competition and improve the performance of their offspring [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This phenomenon had been reported for a number of lepidopteran species from different families, including <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> (Noctuidae) and <italic>Manduca quinquemaculata</italic> (Sphingidae) on tobacco [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], <italic>Ostrinia nubilalis</italic>, <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> (both Crambidae) and <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Noctuidae) on corn [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], <italic>Chilo partellus</italic> (Crambidae) on African forage grass [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Noctuidae) on cotton [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (Sphingidae) on tomato [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Several studies of lepidopteran oviposition preference have shown that females cannot discriminate between <italic>Bt</italic> and the corresponding non-<italic>Bt</italic> cultivars [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggesting that the planting of <italic>Bt</italic> crops will not alter adult oviposition behaviour. In these cases, however, the experiments only assessed the oviposition preference for undamaged <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants. The experiments thus ignored the potential effects of differential larval damage on <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants.</p><p>In the current study, we conducted laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments to test the hypothesis that females of the striped stem borer <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> (SSB) prefer to lay eggs on undamaged <italic>Bt</italic> rice plants over damaged non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants. If this hypothesis is correct, <italic>Bt</italic> plants would serve as a dead-end trap crop for the adjacent non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants. We also compared the performance of early-instar SSB on healthy rice plants or plants that had been damaged by conspecifics to determine whether neonate fitness differs on undamaged versus damaged rice plants. Finally, we identified the volatile organic compounds that are released by undamaged and caterpillar-damaged rice plants, which might explain the oviposition response of SBB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>(a)</label><title>Plants and insects</title><p>The transgenic <italic>Bt</italic> rice line T1C-19 and the corresponding non-transformed near isoline Minghui 63 (MH63) were used in all experiments.

After 15 days, the seedlings were individually transplanted into plastic pots (diameter 20 cm, height 18 cm) with holes in the bottom and containing a 3 : 1 mixture of peat and vermiculite (Meihekou Factory, Meihekou, China). Potted plants were placed in a cement pool filled with water to a 2 cm depth. Water was replaced weekly, and nitrogenous fertilizer was applied once each week before tillering and once every two weeks after tillering.

The airstream in the tunnel (0.2 m s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was produced by a fan (CHW-124-401, BROAD Clean Air Technology Co.

In each choice test, the two types of rice plants (treatments) were placed at the upwind end of the wind tunnel, 0.5 m apart. A plastic plate serving as an insect release platform was placed at the downwind end of the wind tunnel, 1.5 m away from the plants. For insect release, a cubic metal cage (226 cm<sup>3</sup>) containing one <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> female that had been mated 2 days earlier was placed on the insect release platform with an opening towards the rice plants. Each released moth was observed for 30 min, and its landing on either of the plants for at least 10 s was recorded. Moths were removed once they had made a choice. The moths that failed to make a choice within the observation period were categorized as &#x02018;no choice&#x02019;. The positions of the two rice plants were exchanged after each insect observation to eliminate a position bias. The wind tunnel was cleaned with detergent (5%, v/v) followed by alcohol (90%, v/v) and was then washed with clean water at the end of each day. Each moth was tested only once, and a total of 70&#x02013;120 females were individually tested in each choice experiment.

In addition, one mixture containing all 10 compounds and one mixture containing a subset of five compounds (2-heptanol, &#x003b1;-cedrene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, caryophyllene and 2-nonanone) were tested based on the results for the individual compounds. The mixtures were prepared in ratios that corresponded to the ratios of compounds detected in the collection of volatiles from caterpillar-damaged rice plants. The compound 2-nonanone was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) with 99% purity.

With the combined presence of non-<italic>Bt</italic> crops (including those planted as refuges) and non-crop habitats, pests targeted by the <italic>Bt</italic> trait have a choice between <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> crops or weeds. The host preference of these pests has important consequences for both insect pest management and insect resistance management.</p><p>Our assays showed that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females have no oviposition preference for healthy <italic>Bt</italic> versus non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants. These results are consistent with previous studies with cotton, maize, rice and oilseed rape, suggesting that the transformation and the expression of the <italic>cry</italic> genes does not affect the oviposition behaviour of the target pests [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our previous study also confirmed that undamaged <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants (the same rice lines used as in the current study) emitted the same number of volatiles and there were no significant differences in the quantity of each volatile compound between the treatments [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We did document, however, a significant oviposition preference of <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females for undamaged rice plants versus plants damaged by conspecific larvae, whether the plants were <italic>Bt</italic> or non-<italic>Bt</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females avoid laying eggs on host plants damaged by conspecifics. As noted in the introduction, this phenomenon has been previously observed for a number of other lepidopteran species. However, this behaviour is not exhibited by all insects. Leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), for example, preferred damaged plants to undamaged plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20181283C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Even some lepidopterans prefer damaged plants. <italic>S. littoralis</italic>, for example, preferentially oviposited on cotton plants damaged by third to fourth instar larvae rather than on undamaged plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We have also found that the mated females of another lepidopteran rice pest, <italic>C. medinalis</italic>, showed no oviposition preference between undamaged and conspecific-damaged rice plants (YQ Wang &#x00026; YH Li 2018, unpublished data).</p><p>The question remains why <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females prefer to lay eggs on healthy rice plants. According to the &#x02018;mother knows best&#x02019; principle, one reason could be that the offspring perform better on undamaged rice plants than on damaged rice plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results support this hypothesis in that the survival and body weight of <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> larvae were lower on caterpillar-damaged rice plants than on healthy rice plants. A possible explanation is the induced production of trypsin proteinase inhibitors in rice plants in response to <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> infestation [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As has been reported for many moth species, females appear to recognize damaged plants by the volatile compounds released [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our GC-MS analyses combined with the wind tunnel experiments indicated that five volatile compounds, namely 2-heptanol, &#x003b1;-cedrene, &#x003b2;-myrcene, caryophyllene and 2-nonanone, were mainly responsible for the repellence of damaged plants.</p><p>Based on the current finding that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females avoid laying eggs on plants previously damaged by conspecific larvae and based on the previous finding that neonate <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> cannot survive or cause noticeable damage on <italic>Bt</italic> rice plants in the field [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we expect that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females will migrate from damaged non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice fields to protected <italic>Bt</italic> rice fields for egg laying when the <italic>Bt</italic> and non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants are in close proximity. As a consequence, the offspring produced on <italic>Bt</italic> rice plants will be killed by the <italic>Bt</italic> protein. This is inconsistent with the &#x02018;mother knows best&#x02019; theory. As suggested by Jongsma <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], female moths appear to be unable to detect the presence of the <italic>Bt</italic> proteins and may therefore fail to evolve an avoidance behaviour. Our results thus indicate that <italic>Bt</italic> rice could serve as a dead-end trap crop for <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> and would protect adjacent non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice as suggested by Shelton <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Given the small-scale rice farming systems prevalent in China [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the effects on <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> populations might be significant. This, however, needs to be confirmed under field conditions once <italic>Bt</italic> rice is cultivated on larger areas. Interestingly, planthoppers such as <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) show a different behaviour. When given the choice, they prefer to oviposit on caterpillar-damaged (non-<italic>Bt</italic>) rice plants compared to undamaged (<italic>Bt</italic>) rice plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice refuges planted adjacent to <italic>Bt</italic> rice might thus act as a trap crop and protect <italic>Bt</italic> rice from this non-target pest.</p><p>Another important implication of our results relates to the evolution of <italic>Bt</italic> resistance in the target pests, which is a major threat for the sustainable use of <italic>Bt</italic> crops [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Currently, the most commonly practised strategy for delaying the evolution of <italic>Bt</italic> resistance is the establishment of refuges with non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Because <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> is highly specialized for rice, structured non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice refuges rather than natural refuges adjacent to <italic>Bt</italic> rice will be necessary [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the value of the refuges in delaying the development of <italic>Bt</italic> resistance is based on the assumption of a random oviposition and mating by the target pest across the <italic>Bt</italic> plants and the non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants in the refuges [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20181283C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our results suggest that this assumption is invalid for <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> because females will avoid ovipositing on the non-<italic>Bt</italic> refuge plants once such plants are damaged. Data modelling for a different Lepidoptera species (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>; Noctuidae) suggest that oviposition preference for <italic>Bt</italic> over non-<italic>Bt</italic> plants will significantly affect the speed of resistance evolution to the <italic>Bt</italic> trait [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This should be taken into account when designing the resistance management plan for <italic>Bt</italic> rice in China, especially because <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> can have up to five generations per year [<xref rid="RSPB20181283C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The current findings indicate that <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> females will show a strong oviposition preference for <italic>Bt</italic> over non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants once the plants have been exposed to the pest. This occurs because pest damage will be much higher on the non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice and because the females prefer to oviposit on undamaged plants. The results suggest that by acting as a dead-end trap crop, <italic>Bt</italic> rice could help protect adjacent non-<italic>Bt</italic> rice plants against <italic>C. suppressalis</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Yongjun Lin (Huazhong Agricultural University) for providing rice seeds.
