    "Chinese rice wine (CRW) is widely known for keeping good health and commonly used in the traditional Chinese medicine prescription guiding drug. This study assesses the effects of CRW on antifatigue and antiaging activities in mice models. Mice were randomly divided into four groups performing with 0.25 ml of distilled water, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.4 ml of CRW for 15 consecutive days. The CRW could obviously increase the content of liver glycogen (LG) and decrease the levels of blood lactic acid (BLA)and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to improve antifatigue ability. In antiaging assay, CRW significantly increased the activity of SOD in liver, the activities of GSH-Px and CAT in brain cortex, body quality, thymus index, and spleen index, and decreased liver MDA levels, liver total cholesterol content, and AChE levels in hippocampus. The CRW has potent antifatigue ability and could minimize the occurrence of age-associated disorders."
