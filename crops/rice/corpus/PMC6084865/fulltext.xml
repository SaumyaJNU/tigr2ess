Disentangling the role of these various influences helps us understand the capacity of agriculture to adapt to change. Here we explore the impact of climate variability on rice yield and production in the Philippines from 1987&#x02013;2016 in both irrigated and rainfed production systems at various scales. Over this period, rice production is affected by variations in soil moisture, which are largely driven by the El Ni&#x000f1;o&#x02013;Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We found that the climate impacts on rice production are strongly seasonally modulated and differ considerably by region. As expected, rainfed upland rice production systems are more sensitive to soil moisture variability than irrigated paddy rice. About 10% of the variance in rice production anomalies on the national level co-varies with soil moisture changes, which in turn are strongly negatively correlated with an index capturing ENSO variability. Our results show that while temperature variability is of limited importance in the Philippines today, future climate projections suggest that by the end of the century, temperatures might regularly exceed known limits to rice production if warming continues unabated. Therefore, skillful seasonal prediction will likely become increasingly crucial to provide the necessary information to guide agriculture management to mitigate the compounding impacts of soil moisture variability and temperature stress. Detailed case studies like this complement global yield studies and provide important local perspectives that can help in food policy decisions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>MFS was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (project code IBS- R028-D1) and the NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, administered by UCAR's Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Sciences (CPAESS).</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stuecker</surname><given-names>Malte F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>MT was funded by a grant from the Tamaki Foundation</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tigchelaar</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MFS was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (project code IBS- R028-D1) and the NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, administered by UCAR's Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Sciences (CPAESS) and MT was funded by a grant from the Tamaki Foundation.

The Philippines produces approximately 3% of the world&#x02019;s rice in both &#x0201c;lowland&#x0201d; flooded transplanted paddies and &#x0201c;upland&#x0201d; rainfed direct seeded areas [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Variations in crop yields can be explained by either endogenous drivers, such as genetics (including breeding methods&#x02013;pure line, synthetic, hybrid) and agronomy (including technology&#x02013;use of fertilizer, irrigation, machinery) [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and exogenous forcing such as climate variability, which has been reported to decrease the influence of genetics [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The role of climate is becoming increasingly important due to anthropogenic climate change, which could drastically change local environments, damage yields [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and influence the yield stability of staple crops [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here we assess how current and future climate variability influences the various modes of rice production in the Philippines.</p><p>Continuing to feed a growing world population expected to reach ~9 billion by 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] while faced with a changing climate is a tremendous challenge. To date, global food production has steadily increased through innovations in agricultural technology (improved practices and genetics). The Philippines has mirrored global trends, with population increasing from ~26 million in 1960 to ~101 million in 2015, and rice production increasing from ~3.9 million tonnes in 1961 to ~19.0 million tonnes in 2014. This large improvement has been due to increased yields (production per unit area) and increased acreage being placed into production [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether it will be possible to sustain increasing production into the future [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and if the changing land use patterns for agriculture are sustainable [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The Philippines is a large and spatially heterogeneous country, consisting of 7107 islands divided into 18 political regions and 81 provinces. There are four major climate regimes: 1) distinct wet monsoon and dry season, 2) no distinct dry season but a strong wet monsoon season, 3) intermediate between type 1 and 2, where there is a short wet monsoon and short dry season, and 4) an even distribution of rainfall throughout the year [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Planting dates vary between regions based largely on differences in climate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201426.s005">S1 Table</xref>). While rice in the Philippines is grown throughout the year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201426.s005">S1 Table</xref>), the largest production share is grown during the wet season. Due to this diversity of planting and harvesting, the government of the Philippines takes annual, semester, and quarterly statistics on rice production and harvested areas. Farms in the Philippines are generally small (less than two hectares on average; [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), which may limit the implementation of advanced farming technologies. Currently, irrigated paddy rice accounts for 60% of total production [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with the remainder grown as upland directly seeded rice.</p><p>In the Philippines, the dominant climate influence on inter-annual timescales is from the El Ni&#x000f1;o&#x02013;Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO has pronounced effects on global rainfall and temperature variability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It has been shown that this inter-annual climate variability can drastically impact crop yields and production globally [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the tropical western Pacific region, El Ni&#x000f1;o events (the warm phase of ENSO) generally have a negative effect on farming. Specifically, El Ni&#x000f1;o induced droughts in the western Pacific have detrimentally affected Indonesian rice production [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with worsening effects projected in response to greenhouse gas forcing [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Previous work on ENSO in the Philippines has shown that dry-season rice production is negatively impacted by El Ni&#x000f1;o on Luzon Island [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, tropical cyclones are a source of weather variability that is strongly seasonally modulated and exhibits localized impacts, suggesting that climate-yield and climate-production relationships need to be evaluated regionally and on sub-annual timescales.</p><p>An important limiting factor to increased food production in response to population growth and dietary shifts in the next century is the ability of crops to respond to climate variability, for instance soil moisture, surface temperatures, and the frequency of severe storms [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Studies of climate impacts on crops typically either use process-based crop models, or evaluate the statistical relationship between crop production and climate variability in the past. Here we use this latter method to evaluate the impact of climate variability on rice production in the Philippines in different spatial and temporal contexts, and compare the range of past climate variability to projected future climate change to assess whether these relationships can be expected to hold in the future. We find that using a finer temporal and spatial resolution provides a more detailed understanding of climatic drivers of rice production, especially for upland (rainfed) rice, which is significantly impacted by ENSO through modifications in soil moisture. By the end of the century, temperatures will likely exceed present-day ranges, and will thus become an additional limiting factor to rice yield and production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Rice production data from 1987&#x02013;2016 were obtained from the Philippine government statistic authority (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://countrystat.psa.gov.ph/">http://countrystat.psa.gov.ph/</ext-link>) for each political region and nationwide.

A notable exception to this is Quarter 4, when correlations between these two variables are small, or even negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Production in this quarter is the highest of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and represents the wet-season crop.

In Quarter 3, when correlations between soil moisture and total rice production are strongly positive in most regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g003">Fig 3</xref>), there were few locations with significant correlations between previous-quarter soil moisture and rice yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

During the dry season (Quarters 1 and 2) on the other hand, there are also significant regional correlations between soil moisture and rice yields, implying that climate variability in this season affects both plants and planting decisions. Mean climatological soil moisture conditions thus strongly affect the rice production response to climatic forcing. In contrast to soil moisture, in most regions temperature variability has a much lower correlation with rice yields. In some regions however, ENSO-induced temperature and precipitation changes have an effect in the same direction: El Ni&#x000f1;o events usually result in dry and hot conditions in the Philippines, which both are associated with a decrease in yield (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201426.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

During this main growing season background soil moisture conditions are high, so factors other than climate drive planting decisions and crop yields.

Other factors that contribute to regional differences include different rice variety choices, different management practices (fertilization, mechanization, planting date, post-harvest storage), as well as different market demands. Cropping calendars also differ across political regions, which creates a differential ability to respond to climate events (e.g., ENSO), accentuating seasonal differences and changing vulnerability.

Moreover, there is a complex agricultural landscape established in the northern Philippines, specifically in Ifugao (rice terraces), where historic intensification has been accompanied by extensification [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These examples support the idea that the agro-cultural context can help mitigate the impacts of environmental pressure on food security.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>The role of temperature variability</title><p>Our results indicate that temperature variability at present is not a big driver of rice production variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201426.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Under continued greenhouse gas emissions however, the range of temperature variability in the Philippines is projected to be outside the present-day envelope by the end of the century (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Increasing temperatures will have major implications for rice production in the Philippines. Recent work estimated that for every degree Celsius global temperature increase, global mean rice yields will decline by 3.2 &#x000b1; 3.7% [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These reductions were projected without consideration of potential CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, adaptation in agronomic practices, or genetic adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. While a recent meta-analysis identified an increase in yields under increased CO<sub>2</sub>, this may not be an even increase across crops or regions [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Additionally, a comparison between historic and modern cultivars suggests that during modern breeding there has not been a selection for increased response to increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], limiting the potential future CO<sub>2</sub>-fertilization effect.</p><p>The temperature sensitivity of crops is dependent on growth stage [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], time of day, and time of year, but generally a temperature increase of one degree can decrease yields by up to 10% once a temperature threshold is reached in rice [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Due to this nonlinear threshold behavior, the relative importance of temperature variability to yield variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201426.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) may increase in a warmer climate. The combined effects of high temperatures and moisture deficits could critically alter the seasonality and locality of the impact of ENSO on rice production. Furthermore, by the end of the century, inter-annual climate variability will regularly push climate in the Philippines outside the climatic range of current tropical gene accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Most tropical rice accessions currently grow at quarterly temperatures below 28&#x000b0;C. In a 4&#x000b0;C warmer world, median quarterly temperatures will exceed this threshold year-round. In the second quarter in particular, temperatures will already regularly exceed 28&#x000b0;C with just 2&#x000b0;C of global warming. The performance of tropical rice crops in these climatic conditions has not been tested and is thus potentially a large threat to future food security.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Implications for plant breeding</title><p>The ability to increase yields under rising temperatures is a major target for plant breeders [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, modern crop plants have undergone two significant population bottlenecks&#x02013;the first during domestication and the second during improvement processes&#x02013;that have resulted in a significant decrease of the crop&#x02019;s genetic diversity relative to their wild progenitors [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. For instance, modern Asian rice retains ~80% of the genetic diversity of its wild progenitor [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Generally, plant breeding involves crossing 'good by good', a strategy that results in a continuing loss of genetic diversity. Breeding targets focused on yield and quality have often left behind traits from landraces (heirloom lines that have not undergone modern breeding) and crop wild relatives [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Among these are many traits associated with tolerance to abiotic stress associated with climate change [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. There have been increasing efforts to collect data surrounding landrace and wild material in germplasm collections (phenotypes, genotypes, biophysical, environmental) [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], which has led to the creation of a platform to understand the fastest and most practical way to bring in traits from landrace and wild crop material [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Breeding is a long-term endeavor, with a long research and development time [<xref rid="pone.0201426.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This lag time requires a forward-looking approach in order to have plant material ready to be used in the field in time for projected changes in climate. By estimating the current and future temperature envelope of rice production in the Philippines, and comparing this to bioclimatic data of collection locations of rice accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201426.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we have reduced the number of potential parents that could be used to breed for climate change, thus implementing the first stage of utilizing collections for breeding for climate change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is an increasing need to understand how climate variability will impact rice yields and production, particularly as human population continues to increase and climate changes. Comparing multiple spatial scales allows for a more complete understanding of what types of policy recommendations should be made, as it allows for a direct partitioning into the political units that are most likely to be effective at driving landscape change. This study identified ENSO as driving a significant part of soil moisture variability in the Philippines, which in turn is correlated with rice production and yield variability. Therefore, skillful seasonal predictions can provide useful information for agriculture management to mitigate climate-induced effects on rice production and yield. Future tropical climates is likely to be outside the range of optimal temperatures for rice production. This is true in the Philippines, and will likely require a modification of both genetics and agronomic practices. Detailed case studies like this will complement global yield impact studies and provide important local perspectives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201426.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>National-level rice yields in the Philippines from 1987&#x02013;2016: Irrigated (blue) and rainfed (red) farming techniques.</title><p>The linear correlation coefficient R denotes the simultaneous correlation. a) Annual rice yield in the Philippines; b) annual rice yield anomalies (with regard to a 7 yr moving average); c) quarterly rice yield.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201426.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201426.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Long-term quarterly mean (1987&#x02013;2016) rice production for both rainfed and irrigated systems.</title><p>Note that grid point values indicate the mean production value of the whole associated province.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201426.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201426.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Long-term quarterly mean (1987&#x02013;2016) rice yield for both rainfed and irrigated systems.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201426.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201426.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Correlation coefficient R between and quarterly rice yield and surface temperature anomalies in the previous quarter.</title><p>The annual cycle is removed and yield anomalies are with regard to a 7 yr moving average.
