    "Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae: Orthotylinae), including nymphs and adults, are one of the dominant predators and have a significant role in the biological control of leafhoppers and planthoppers in irrigated rice. In this study, we investigated the antennal morphology, structure and sensilla distribution of C. lividipennis in different instars using scanning electron microscopy. The antennae of both five different nymphal stages and adults were filiform in shape, which consisted of the scape, pedicel and flagellum with two flagellomeres. There were significant differences found in the types of antennal sensilla between nymphs and adults. The multiporous placodea sensilla (MPLA), basiconica sensilla II (BAS II), and sensory pits (SP) only occurred on the antennae of adult C. lividipennis of both sexes. Moreover, there was chaetica sensilla III (CHA III) only observed in males. Sixteen types of antennal sensilla were recorded altogether. They were microtrichia sensilla (MIC), three types of trichoidea sensilla (TRI I-III), three types of chaetica sensilla (CHA I-III), three types of basiconica sensilla (BAS I-III), two types of coeloconica sensilla (COE I and COE II), placodea sensilla (PLA), campaniform sensilla (CAM), MPLA, and SP. In the five different nymphal stages of C. lividipennis, the length of their antennae was significantly increased with the increase of the instar, as well as the number of the TRI II and TRI III. Moreover, sexual dimorphism usually occurred not only in the distribution (CHA III and SP) and the number of antennal sensilla (MIC, BAS II, TRI II, TRI III and MPLA), but also in the length of flagellum (F1 and F2). The possible functions of antennal sensilla are discussed. Those observations could contribute to a better understanding of the development of the olfactory system, and facilitate future studies on the antennal functions in C. lividipennis."
