    "The pyramiding of resistance (R) genes provides broad-spectrum and durable resistance to plant diseases. However, the genetic basis for bacterial blight (BB) resistance remains unclear. The BB R gene pyramided line IRBB54, which expresses xa5 and Xa21, possessed a higher level of resistance than both single R gene lines. Large-scale genotyping of genetic markers in this study revealed similar genetic backgrounds among the near-isogenic lines (NILs), suggesting that resistance in the resistant NILs was mainly conferred by the individual R genes or the interaction between them. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that more than 50% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and more than 70% of the differentially expressed functions, were shared between IRBB54 and IRBB5 or IRBB21. Most of the DEGs in the resistant NILs were downregulated and are predicted to function in cellular and biological process. The DEGs common among the resistant NILs mainly showed non-additive expression patterns and enrichment in stress-related pathways. The differential expression of agronomic trait-controlled genes in the resistant NILs, especially in IRBB54, indicated the existence of potential side-effects resulting from gene pyramiding. Our findings contribute to the understanding of R gene pyramiding, as well as its effects on targeted and non-targeted trait(s)."
