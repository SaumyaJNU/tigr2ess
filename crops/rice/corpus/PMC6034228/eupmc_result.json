    "BACKGROUND:Two strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (ATCC 17802 and 33847) in shrimp, oyster, freshwater fish, pork, chicken and egg fried rice were evaluated for production of hemolysin and exoenzymes of potential importance to the pathogenicity of this bacterium. RESULTS:The two strains of V. parahaemolyticus produced hemolysin, gelatinase, caseinase, phospholipase, urease, DNase and amylase in selected food matrices. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) hemolytic activity was produced by V. parahaemolyticus in egg fried rice > shrimp > freshwater fish > chicken > oyster > pork. But the exoenzyme activities were not consistent with the hemolytic activity profile, being significantly higher (p < 0.05) in shrimp > freshwater fish > chicken > oyster > pork > egg fried rice. Filtrates of V. parahaemolyticus from shrimp, freshwater fish and chicken given intraperitoneally to adult mice induced marked liver and kidney damage and were highly lethal compared with the filtrates of V. parahaemolyticus from oyster > egg fried rice > pork. CONCLUSION:From in vitro and in vivo tests, it appears that the food matrix type has a significant impact on the activity of extracellular products and the pathogenicity of V. parahaemolyticus. From a food safety aspect, it is important to determine which food matrices can stimulate V. parahaemolyticus to produce additional extracellular factors. This is the first report of non-seafood including freshwater fish and chicken contaminated with V. parahaemolyticus to have been shown to be toxic to mice in vivo."
