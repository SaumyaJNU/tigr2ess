In Taiwan, the tropical indica type of <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> originally grown in this area is mix-cultivated with the temperate japonica type of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic>, and this might have led to adaptive changes of both rice host and <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates. In order to better understand how <italic>Xoo</italic> adapts to this unique environment, we collected and analyzed fifty-one <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Taiwan. Three different genetic marker systems consistently identified five groups. Among these groups, two of them had unique sequences in the last acquired ten spacers in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) region, and the other two had sequences that were similar to the Japanese isolate MAFF311018 and the Philippines isolate PXO563, respectively. The genomes of two Taiwanese isolates with unique CRISPR sequence features, XF89b and XM9, were further completely sequenced. Comparison of the genome sequences suggested that XF89b is phylogenetically close to MAFF311018, and XM9 is close to PXO563.

Two pathovars within the same species, <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>) and <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzicola</italic> (<italic>Xoc</italic>), are the most prevalent pathogens that cause diseases in rice around the world. They have a high degree of tissue specificity as well as the host-plant specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. <italic>Xoo</italic> and <italic>Xoc</italic> are distinguished by the tissue types they colonize in rice leaves. <italic>Xoo</italic> colonizes vascular tissues and causes leaf blight disease, whereas <italic>Xoc</italic> invades the mesophyll parenchyma tissues to cause leaf streak disease. <italic>Xoo</italic> can cause disease in both major rice sub-species, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> subsp. <italic>japonica</italic> and <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> subsp. <italic>indica</italic>. However, <italic>Xoc</italic> cannot form severe disease symptoms in <italic>japonica</italic> rice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>Xoo</italic> has a larger host range and causes more serious problems in rice than <italic>Xoc</italic> in Asia, especially in East and East-Northern Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>Xoo</italic> can be further classified into races based on ability to infect different rice cultivars. To date, over 30 races of <italic>Xoo</italic> have been discovered all over the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and the rice blight disease can cause the yield losses up to 70% under environmental conditions favorable to <italic>Xoo</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Cultivation of <italic>Xoo</italic>-resistant rice cultivars is the most effective way of dealing with the blight disease, which would require the establishment of the distribution patterns of clonal <italic>Xoo</italic> populations in the rice growing regions.</p><p id="Par3">The rice blight disease was first reported in Taiwan in 1951<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but occurred infrequently in the fields before 1970s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, after an outburst of rice bacterial blight impacted the local rice cultivation system in 1980s, this disease became a serious cultivation issue in Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although the race identification of local <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates has been reported since then, the isolates and rice varieties used for the classification are limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and a better understanding of <italic>Xoo</italic> population dynamics in Taiwan is needed. Moreover, the <italic>Xoo</italic> populations in Taiwan cannot be compared with populations in the neighboring regions, because (i) the rice hosts selected for race identification are inconsistent in the local studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, (ii) there were insufficient genetic markers for the identification of populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and (iii) the population analyses of Asian <italic>Xoo</italic> in prior studies did not include any samples collected in Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Rice grown in Taiwan is composed of many different varieties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, with the temperate japonica <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> being the major cultivar. This type of rice in Taiwan was originally adopted from Japan in the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century and naturalized through breeding programs. However, the major variety of <italic>O</italic>. <italic>sativa</italic> in Taiwan before the 20<sup>th</sup> century was the indica subspecies from China. With rice varieties from two different origins being cultivated together, <italic>Xoo</italic> in Taiwan may have undergone a unique evolutionary path. In addition to the different pathogenicity of <italic>Xoo</italic> races toward rice cultivars, the major race of <italic>Xoo</italic> may also be different both in geographic regions and time periods. Since <italic>Xoo</italic> is a rapid evolving pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, the selection of cultivated rice varieties may facilitate the race shift or result in the emergence of new races. Indeed, a prior study showed that the shifting of the major race over time in the Philippines might be caused by a dramatic change in the host genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the local rice cultivar-driven changes of <italic>Xoo</italic> populations increases the difficulties in preventing this rice disease, and further emphasizes the necessity for local surveys of <italic>Xoo</italic> populations. By comparing local populations to <italic>Xoo</italic> populations in neighboring regions, it would be possible to delineate the relationships among them, and further focus on the fast-evolving pathogenicity-related genes for breeding of the blight-resistant rice.</p><p id="Par5">Among the available genetic analyses, the insertion sequence <italic>IS1112</italic>, a relatively high copy-number repetitive element in the <italic>Xoo</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) element have been used to characterize the isolates in Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, the groupings based on these two methods are not sufficient to classify the local isolates, and these studies do not provide comparative information among local populations and populations in the neighboring regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To address these issues, we used a robust genetic classification platform to establish the distribution patterns of <italic>Xoo</italic> clonal populations in Taiwan. We further used a genetically hereditable sequence, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and genomic sequencing of representative <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates to study population dynamics of <italic>Xoo</italic> in Taiwan and neighboring regions. Our analyses reveal the complexity of rice cultivation history and indicate that <italic>Xoo</italic> populations in Taiwan may have evolved from multi-sources and undergone a unique evolutionary path.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Taiwan have five distinct clonal populations</title><p id="Par6"><italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Asia have been suggested to have evolved into five modern genetic populations by RFLP or variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, isolates in Taiwan were not included in those studies. We used RAPD primers employed in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> to analyze 51 Taiwanese isolates collected from 1986 to 2010. However, 38 of these primers had low resolutions in the isolates, and only 11 of them could be used for grouping. These results indicate that <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Taiwan are genetically close to each other. However, from these 11 RAPD markers, we could still separate the 51 isolates into five different clonal populations named R1 to R5 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">We next used RFLP to reconfirm the grouping of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Taiwan by RAPD. This method has been widely used to assist race identification as well as the molecular classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we used the <italic>avrXa7</italic> (one of the TALE) repeat region as a probe to classify the pattern of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates generated from RFLP (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). The grouping of TALE patterns resulted in four major groups (T1 to T4) and two outgroup isolates, XO4a (T5) and XM9 (T6) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>). The RAPD and RFLP analyses generated similar groupings, except the T2 group of the RFLP analysis was split into R2 and R5 groups in the RAPD classification.</p><p id="Par8">In order to generate novel and reliable markers for fast identification and confirmation of the <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates in Taiwan, we introduced a third method, i.e., searching for indel regions of the reference isolates and different signatures of restriction maps between two local isolates, XF89b and XM42. Due to their high virulence, these two isolates were used to select for <italic>Xoo</italic>-resistant rice cultivars in Taiwan over 30 years. We generated genome restriction maps of XF89b and XM42 using an optical mapping technique (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and compared them to the maps of KACC10331, MAFF311018, and PXO99A, which were generated by <italic>in silico</italic> genome restriction mapping from their respective genomic sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We found that the region within and near T6SS-II is highly variable among these isolates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), which is similar to the study on <italic>Pantoea ananatis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, we designed four molecular markers for the grouping. These four markers could generate eight different patterns (S1&#x02013;S8) in all the Taiwanese isolates and thus increased the classification accuracy (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In this marker identification assay, we observed that most of the isolates showed consistent classification as in the RAPD analysis. Only five isolates had different marker patterns and thus were grouped into additional classes (<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">S8</xref>) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). By analyzing the binary data generated from these three grouping strategies (Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), these 51 isolates were classified into five major groups. Two groups were evolutionarily closer to each other by the neutral marker RAPD analysis, so we designated these five groups as G1, G2a, G2b, G3, and G4 (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Population surveys showed that from 1981 to 2010 the G1 population increased and the G4 population decreased, whereas G2a and G3 populations remained relatively steady (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). G2a and G3 constitute the major clonal populations in Taiwan, and they accounted for 54.9% (28/51) of the collected samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All five groups showed a geographically related clonal distribution (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). G1 and G2b were mainly collected in the northern part of Taiwan, and G4 was mostly discovered in the southern part, whereas G2a and G3 could be found from central to southern Taiwan.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>T6SS-II region and marker polymorphism in Taiwanese isolates.

The CRISPR regions of nineteen isolates from each Taiwanese clonal population were randomly chosen, and the 10 spacers near the LDR were sequenced or obtained from a prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

In contrast, G2b shared similar spacer sequences and order with PXO563 (Philippine race 10) with only two differences being found within these 10 spacers.

Two G4 isolates XI3 and XM42 had different spacers, with XI3 being similar to G2b and XM42 similar to G3, suggesting that G4 group is a hybrid group, with its CRISPR regions inherited from either G2b or G3.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Alignment of CRISPR spacers from the <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<italic>Xoo</italic>) genomic sequences.

In our analysis, the G2b group of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates, which were highly similar to PXO563 in CRISPR spacers, were first collected during the 1981 to 1990 period and continuously observed in the next two survey periods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), whereas the Philippine race 10 (PXO563) had only been collected in 1998 to 2002 period and therefore only accounted for a small proportion of total samples collected in that period in the Philippines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Considering the appearance time and proportion of the Philippine race 10 (PXO563) in the Philippines and its close relationship with the G2b group in Taiwan, the Philippine race 10 (PXO563) might have spread from Taiwan or nearby countries to the Philippines.

Although the recombination events were not strong enough to disrupt the linkage signal in the Xoo-A group due to strong host selection, it might still be an important source of variability. Thus, we focused on searching for the unique genes and recombination events. We found that a region containing T6SS-II and putative T6SS-related genes were variable in their sequences in the indel map (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that T6SS-II region is not only variable between the Xoo-A, Xoo-B and Xoo-C groups, but frequently rearranged even within the Xoo-A group, in which the isolates had similar genomic backgrounds. This finding implies that the evolutionary rate might be high in this region.

The fifth TALE island of both XF89b and MAFF311018 contains a single pseudo-TALE with a similar repeat region, but XM9 and its closest isolates, PXO563 and PXO71, have two pseudo-TALEs in the region, one of which is similar to the pseudo-TALE in XF89b and MAFF311018 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).

In order to investigate whether there are some TALEs that are uniquely evolved in Taiwan, we used TALE sequences of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates from other regions and Taiwanese isolates to generate a DisTAL tree using each repeat of TALEs as a unit and transform it into a coded repeat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The pair-wise alignment was then applied to construct the tree. From the DisTAL tree, we found that XF89b and XM9 shared five identical TALE repeat arrays (TalAA, TalAE, TalAH, TalAO and TalAR). Nevertheless, other TALEs were in different sub-roots (TalAB, TalAD, TalAP and TalAQ). XF89b and XM9 also share two identical RVDs of the TALEs in the AnnoTALE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> classes (TalAG and TalAL) but have short distance in DisTAL tree. This is caused by the amino acid variations in the repeat arrays other than RVDs. Also, these two isolates had eight TALEs classified into different AnnoTALE classes and sub-roots (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These results suggest an early divergence occurred between XF89b and XM9. Interestingly, the DisTAL tree showed that one of the TALEs in XM9, <italic>Tal3a</italic><sub>XM9</sub>, was an outgroup of all the analyzed TALEs. It has a remarkably short sequence with a 3.5 repeat array and a complete TALE sequence without disruption. Indeed, this short repeat array was also shown in RFLP analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). This small fragment was not unique in XM9, 13 (27%) other Taiwanese isolates also contained this or similar-sized fragment. Over a quarter of the collected samples have the short central repeats, implying that it is not a recent mutated form. This TALE is believed to be too short to bind DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Recently, a study on Xo1 suggests that TALEs with short central repeats (at least 3.5 repeats) are required to trigger the rice resistance. However, studies on truncated TALEs (truncTALEs) and/or interfering TALEs (iTALEs) reveal that truncTALEs/iTALEs can mimic the TALE structure and overcome the Xo1- and Xa1-mediated resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

On the contrary, <italic>OsHEN1</italic> was up-regulated 6-fold under XF89b infection (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Moreover, XM9 also showed many variations in TALE repeat arrays and a different predicted target list as well as the transcriptional levels of the targeted rice genes from other TALEs within the AnnoTALE classes. This suggests that XM9 might be under a strong selection pressure to escape the gene activation traps, or it has evolved a new ability to target other host genes. Taken together, XF89b and XM9 have similar TALE island distribution in the genome as the isolates of Xoo-A clade, but they only share a few types of TALEs. In addition, they only share about one-fourth of TALE targets that can be induced by the inoculation of both isolates. Therefore, further investigation in recognition of these TALEs will be required to better characterize the effects of changes in the RVDs toward rice hosts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Different <italic>Xoo</italic> clonal populations regulate rice genes distinctively</title><p id="Par24">Besides the regulations of TALE-targeted host genes, different clonal populations may also regulate different sets of host genes to overcome the obstacles from various host genetic backgrounds during colonization. From the molecular classification of Taiwanese <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates, we observed that G2a, and G3 dominate the populations, and G1 was increasing in the last survey period. To understand whether these three populations regulate different sets of the host genes, we chose representative isolates from these three populations, XE3 (G1), XM9 (G2a) and XF89b (G3), for transcriptomic analyses after the inoculation of local temperate japonica rice, TNG67. XE3 had exactly the same sequence and order in the last 10 CRISPR spacers with MAFF311018. Also, it showed similar TALE patterns in Southern blot assay as well as the indel marker assay with MAFF311018 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">After the inoculation of TNG67 with these three isolates, we found that 4924 rice genes were up-regulated and 3856 genes were down-regulated by XE3, XM9 or XF89b (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). In the genome and molecular marker analyses, we observed that XF89b (G3) was genetically closer to MAFF311018, and XE3 (G1) was considered to belong to the same group as MAFF311018. On the other hand, XM9 (G2a) phylogenetically separated from the other four groups at the earlier time point. Hence, XE3 and XF89b may induce a more similar proportion of host genes than either XM9 and XE3 or XF89b and XE3. As expected, among the 4924 up-regulated genes in TNG67 after inoculation of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates, 2430 (49.3%) of these genes were up-regulated by both XE3 and XF89b, which is more than genes up-regulated by XE3/XM9 (37.6%) or XE3/XF89b (38.5%) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Among these 4924 genes, one-third of genes were up-regulated by all inoculated isolates, and these genes might be core genes responding to <italic>Xoo</italic> infections. Indeed, GO enrichments showed that these genes were mainly involved in the responses to stresses and metabolic processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). Interestingly, there were still many genes that were specifically up-regulated under the infections of one or two isolates. These isolate-specific <italic>Xoo</italic>-induced genes were enriched in response to the stimuli and were also involved in localization and transport (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). As the OsSWEET11/OsSWEET14 are known as sugar transporters, and many TALEs target these transporters to create a more suitable environment for <italic>Xoo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, the transcript levels of transporters are crucial for the fitness of <italic>Xoo</italic> races. Thus, the enrichment of genes involved in transport in the non-core responsive gene list might result in different fitness of these three <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates toward different rice cultivars.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Transcriptome profiles of differentially expressed genes in TNG67 after inoculation of <italic>Xoo</italic> isolates.

Genome SNPs and CRISPR spacer analyses suggested that G2a and G4 were evolutionarily closer to the Philippine Xoo-A group of isolates, whereas G3 and G1 were closer to the Japanese isolate MAFF311018. This phenomenon could be caused by the mixed cultivation of both indica and japonica rice originally from China and Japan, respectively. Comparison of genome indel regions and mutational analyses also revealed the possible important role of T6SS-II in <italic>Xoo</italic> pathogenicity. TALE analysis also revealed that XF89b and XM9 may target different genes in rice, and some of TALE genes, such as <italic>Tal6c</italic><sub>XM9</sub> and <italic>Tal6c</italic><sub>XF89b</sub>, evolved faster in Taiwanese isolates than isolates in other countries. Furthermore, by genomic comparison of two local isolates with isolates from neighboring regions, we are able to depict the distribution patterns of East Asian <italic>Xoo</italic> populations and how they spread and adapt to local environments. These results contribute to our understanding of the population dynamics of this important rice pathogen and also provide a novel means through which <italic>Xoo</italic>-rice interactions may be studied in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bacterial isolates, plasmids, primers and isolation of genomic DNA</title><p id="Par27">Fifty-one isolates of <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> were collected from a randomly chosen areas in Taiwan by the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). <italic>X</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were grown in LB medium at 28&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 3 days and 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 18&#x02009;hours, respectively.
