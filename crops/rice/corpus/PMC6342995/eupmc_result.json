    "Rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a major rice disease. In Taiwan, the tropical indica type of Oryza sativa originally grown in this area is mix-cultivated with the temperate japonica type of O. sativa, and this might have led to adaptive changes of both rice host and Xoo isolates. In order to better understand how Xoo adapts to this unique environment, we collected and analyzed fifty-one Xoo isolates in Taiwan. Three different genetic marker systems consistently identified five groups. Among these groups, two of them had unique sequences in the last acquired ten spacers in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) region, and the other two had sequences that were similar to the Japanese isolate MAFF311018 and the Philippines isolate PXO563, respectively. The genomes of two Taiwanese isolates with unique CRISPR sequence features, XF89b and XM9, were further completely sequenced. Comparison of the genome sequences suggested that XF89b is phylogenetically close to MAFF311018, and XM9 is close to PXO563. Here, documentation of the diversity of groups of Xoo in Taiwan provides evidence of the populations from different sources and hitherto missing information regarding distribution of Xoo populations in East Asia."
