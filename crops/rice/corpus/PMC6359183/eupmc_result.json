    "Early planting is one of the strategies used to increase grain yield in temperate regions. However, poor cold tolerance in castor inhibits seed germination, resulting in lower seedling emergence and biomass. Here, the elite castor variety Tongbi 5 was used to identify the differential abundance protein species (DAPS) between cold stress (4 °C) and control conditions (30 °C) imbibed seeds. As a result, 127 DAPS were identified according to isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) strategy. These DAPS were mainly involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, translation and posttranslational modification, stress response, lipid transport and metabolism, and signal transduction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) demonstrated that the quantitative proteomics data collected here were reliable. This study provided some invaluable insights into the cold stress responses of early imbibed castor seeds: (1) up-accumulation of all DAPS involved in translation might confer cold tolerance by promoting protein synthesis; (2) stress-related proteins probably protect the cell against damage caused by cold stress; (3) up-accumulation of key DAPS associated with fatty acid biosynthesis might facilitate resistance or adaptation of imbibed castor seeds to cold stress by the increased content of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA). The data has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010043."
