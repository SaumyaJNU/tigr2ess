    "Rice blast (caused by Magnaporthe oryzae) is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. While many blast resistance (R) genes have been identified and deployed in rice cultivars, little is known about the R gene-mediated defense mechanism. We used a rice transgenic line harboring the resistance gene Piz-t to investigate the R gene-mediated resistance response to infection.We conducted comparative proteome profiling of the Piz-t transgenic Nipponbare line (NPB-Piz-t) and wild-type Nipponbare (NPB) inoculated with M. oryzae at 24, 48, 72Â h post-inoculation (hpi) using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis. Comparative analysis of the response of NPB-Piz-t to the avirulent isolate KJ201 and the virulent isolate RB22 identified 114 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between KJ201-inoculated NPB-Piz-t (KJ201-Piz-t) and mock-treated NPB-Piz-t (Mock-Piz-t), and 118 DEPs between RB22-inoculated NPB-Piz-t (RB22-Piz-t) and Mock-Piz-t. Among the DEPs, 56 occurred commonly in comparisons KJ201-Piz-t/Mock-Piz-t and RB22-Piz-t/Mock-Piz-t. In a comparison of the responses of NPB and NPB-Piz-t to isolate KJ201, 93 DEPs between KJ201-Piz-t and KJ201-NPB were identified. DEPs in comparisons KJ201-Piz-t/Mock-Piz-t, RB22-Piz-t/Mock-Piz-t and KJ201-Piz-t/KJ201-NPB contained a number of proteins that may be involved in rice response to pathogens, including pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, hormonal regulation-related proteins, defense and stress response-related proteins, receptor-like kinase, and cytochrome P450. Comparative analysis further identified 7 common DEPs between the comparisons KJ201-Piz-t/KJ201-NPB and KJ201-Piz-t/RB22-Piz-t, including alcohol dehydrogenase I, receptor-like protein kinase, endochitinase, similar to rubisco large subunit, NADP-dependent malic enzyme, and two hypothetical proteins.Our results provide a valuable resource for discovery of complex protein networks involved in the resistance response of rice to blast fungus."
