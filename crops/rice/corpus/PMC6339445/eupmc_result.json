    "BACKGROUND:Waterlogging is one of the main abiotic stresses that limit wheat production. Quantitative proteomics analysis has been applied in the study of crop abiotic stress as an effective way in recent years (e.g. salt stress, drought stress, heat stress and waterlogging stress). However, only a few proteins related to primary metabolism and signal transduction, such as UDP - glucose dehydrogenase, UGP, beta glucosidases, were reported to response to waterlogging stress in wheat. The differentially expressed proteins between genotypes of wheat in response to waterlogging are less-defined. In this study, two wheat genotypes, one is sensitive to waterlogging stress (Seri M82, named as S) and the other is tolerant to waterlogging (CIGM90.863, named as T), were compared in seedling roots under hypoxia conditions to evaluate the different responses at proteomic level. RESULTS:A total of 4560 proteins were identified and the number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were 361, 640, 788 in S and 33, 207, 279 in T in 1, 2, 3 days, respectively. These DEPs included 270 common proteins, 681 S-specific and 50 T-specific proteins, most of which were misc., protein processing, DNA and RNA processing, amino acid metabolism and stress related proteins induced by hypoxia. Some specific proteins related to waterlogging stress, including acid phosphatase, oxidant protective enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, were significantly different between S and T. A total of 20 representative genes encoding DEPs, including 7 shared DEPs and 13 cultivar-specific DEPs, were selected for further RT-qPCR analysis. Fourteen genes showed consistent dynamic expression patterns at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS:Proteins involved in primary metabolisms and protein processing were inclined to be affected under hypoxia stress. The negative effects were more severe in the sensitive genotype. The expression patterns of some specific proteins, such as alcohol dehydrogenases and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, could be applied as indexes for improving the waterlogging tolerance in wheat. Some specific proteins identified in this study will facilitate the subsequent protein function validation and biomarker development."
