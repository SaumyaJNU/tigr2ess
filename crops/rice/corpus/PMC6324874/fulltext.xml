Here we take advantage of the model bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> in which the genotype-to-phenotype map determining evolution of the adaptive &#x02018;wrinkly spreader&#x02019; (WS) type is known. We present mathematical descriptions of three necessary regulatory pathways and use these to predict both the rate at which each mutational route is used and the expected mutational targets. To test predictions, mutation rates and targets were determined for each pathway. Unanticipated mutational hotspots caused experimental observations to depart from predictions but additional data led to refined models. A mismatch was observed between the spectra of WS-causing mutations obtained with and without selection due to low fitness of previously undetected WS-causing mutations. Our findings contribute toward the development of mechanistic models for forecasting evolution, highlight current limitations, and draw attention to challenges in predicting locus-specific mutational biases and fitness effects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Predicting evolution might sound like an impossible task.

As self-evident as this may be, predicting the occurrence of beneficial mutations and their trajectories to improved fitness is fraught with challenges (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000e4;ssig et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless progress has been made for phenotypically diverse asexual populations subject to strong selection. Effective approaches have drawn upon densely sampled sequence data and equilibrium models of molecular evolution to predict amino acid preferences at specific loci (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Luksza and L&#x000e4;ssig, 2014</xref>). Predictive strategies have also been developed based on selection inferred from the shape of coalescent trees (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Neher et al., 2014</xref>). In both instances the models are coarse-grained and sidestep specific molecular and mutational details.</p><p>There is reason to by-pass molecular details: mutation, being a stochastic process, means that for the most part details are likely to be idiosyncratic and unpredictable. But an increasing number of investigations give reason to think otherwise &#x02013; that adaptive molecular evolution might follow rules (<xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">Yampolsky and Stoltzfus, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Pigliucci, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Stern, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Laland et al., 2015</xref>). This is particularly apparent from studies of parallel molecular evolution (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Ostrowski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Flowers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Galen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Kram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus and McCandlish, 2017</xref>), and particularly from studies that show parallel evolution to be attributable &#x02013; at least in part &#x02013; to factors other than selection (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A standard starting position for predicting adaptive evolution recognises the importance of population genetic parameters including mutation rate, generation time, population size, selection and more recently information on the distribution of beneficial fitness effects. An often used approach appeals to &#x02018;origin-fixation&#x02019; models that estimate the probability that selection will realise particular mutational trajectories based on the assumption that the rate of evolution is a function of the rate at which mutations originate, multiplied by their fixation probability (for review, see (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">McCandlish and Stoltzfus, 2014</xref>), for application, see for example (<xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>)). Leaving aside a number of simplifying and restrictive assumptions, population genetic approaches such as those encompassed by origin-fixation models require pre-existing knowledge of (or assumptions concerning) mutation rate to a particular phenotype and selection coefficients (obtained in the absence of frequency dependent effects) and thus have predictive power only in specific situations and with the benefit of hindsight (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">McCandlish and Stoltzfus, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Looking to the future, there is hope that one day it might be possible to predict the course of evolutionary change in response to specific environmental challenges in much the same way as gene function, regulation and interactions can be predicted today based on knowledge of nucleotide sequence data. A central issue is to define the necessary information. Mechanistic understanding of the connection between genotype and phenotype combined with knowledge of the genomic bases of mutational bias offer opportunities for progress.</p><p>Mutations arise randomly with respect to utility, but genetic architecture can influence the translation of mutation into phenotypic variation: the likelihood that a given mutation generates phenotypic effects depends on the genotype-to-phenotype map (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alberch, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Rainey et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the functions of gene products and their regulatory interactions provide information on likely mutational targets underpinning particular phenotypes. For example, consider a hypothetical structural determinant subject to both positive and negative regulation and whose over-expression generates a given adaptive phenotype. Assuming a uniform distribution of mutational events, mutations in the negative regulator (and not the positive activator) will be the primary cause of the adaptive phenotype. This follows from the fact that loss-of-function mutations are more common than gain-of-function mutations. Indeed, an emerging rule indicates that phenotypes determined by genetic pathways that are themselves subject to negative regulation are most likely to arise by loss-of-function mutations in negative regulatory components (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fraebel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mutation is not equally likely at each nucleotide of a given genome (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Lind and Andersson, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Lynch, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Seier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Reijns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus and McCandlish, 2017</xref>). Numerous instances of mutational bias have been reported. Prime examples are simple sequence repeats such as homopolymeric nucleotide tracts or di-, tri- and tetrameric repeats that mutate at high frequency via slipped strand mispairing (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Levinson and Gutman, 1987</xref>). These readily identifiable sequences define contingency loci in obligate human pathogens and commensals (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Moxon et al., 1994</xref>) and are widespread in eukaryotic genomes (<xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Tautz and Renz, 1984</xref>). The behaviour of contingency loci can be further modulated by defects in components of methyl-directed mismatch repair systems (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Richardson and Stojiljkovic, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hammerschmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Heilbron et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Certain palindromic structures also lead to mutational bias (<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Viswanathan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Lovett, 2004</xref>) and promote amplification events that can increase target size for additional mutations (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Roth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kugelberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Reams and Roth, 2015</xref>) Transition-transversion bias (<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Stoltzfus and McCandlish, 2017</xref>) and elevated mutation rates at CpG sites (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Galen et al., 2015</xref>) can further skew the distributions of mutational effects. Additional bias arises from the chromosomal neighbourhood of genes under selection (<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>), the location of genes with regard to interactions with DNA replication/transcription machineries (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al., 2016</xref>), and environmental factors that affect not only mutation rate but also the spectra of mutational events (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Kra&#x00161;ovec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Shewaramani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the genotype-to-phenotype map and mutational biases, predicting adaptive evolution requires ability to know <italic>a priori</italic> the fitness effects of specific mutations. At the present time there is much theoretical and empirical interest in the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</xref>) &#x02014; and particularly the DFE of beneficial mutations (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Orr, 2005</xref>) &#x02014; because of implications for predicting the rate of adaption and likelihood of parallel evolution (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>), but knowledge of the shape of the distribution is insufficient to connect specific mutations to their specific effects, or to their likelihood of occurrence. Such connections require a means of knowing the connection between mutations and their environment-specific fitness effects. This is a tall order. A starting point is to understand the relationship between all possible mutational routes to a particular phenotype and the set that are realised by selection.</p><p>Here we take a bacterial system in which the genetic pathways underpinning evolution of the adaptive &#x02018;wrinkly spreader&#x02019; (WS) type are known and use this to explore the current limits on evolutionary forecasting. <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25 growing in static broth microcosms rapidly depletes available oxygen establishing selective conditions that favour mutants able to colonise the air-liquid interface.

Subsequent work revealed that when these three pathways are eliminated from the ancestral type evolution proceeds along multiple new pathways (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>) resulting in WS types whose fitnesses are indistinguishable from those arising via mutations in Wsp, Aws, or Mws. Parallel evolution of WS involving preferential usage of the Wsp, Aws and Mws pathways is therefore not explained by selection: repeated use of Wsp, Aws and Mws stems from the fact that these pathways are subject to negative regulation and thus, relative to pathways subject to positive regulation, or requiring promoter-activating mutations, gene fusion events, or other rare mutations, present a large mutational target (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given repeatability of WS evolution, knowledge of the Wsp/Aws/Mws pathways, plus genetic tools for mechanistic investigation &#x02014; including capacity to obtain WS mutants in the absence of selection &#x02014; the WS system offers a rare opportunity to explore the extent to which knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype map can lead mechanistic models for evolutionary forecasting.

To achieve such measures we firstly constructed a set of genotypes containing just one of the three focal pathways: PBR721 carries the Wsp pathway but is devoid of Aws and Mws, PBR713 carries the Aws pathway but is devoid of Wsp and Mws, while PBR712 harbours the Mws pathway but is devoid of Wsp and Aws.

WspA (PFLU1219) is a methyl-accepting chemotaxis (MCP) protein that forms a complex with the CheW-like scaffolding proteins WspB (PFLU1220) and WspD (PFLU1222). WspA senses environmental stimuli and transmits the information via conformational changes in the WspA/WspB/WspD complex to effect activity of WspE (PFLU1223), a CheA/Y hybrid histidine kinase response regulator. WspE activates both the WspR (PFLU1225) diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and the CheB-like methylesterase WspF (PFLU1224) following transference of an active phosphoryl group. The activity of WspA is modulated by methylation by the constitutively active CheR-like methyltransferase WspC (PFLU1221) that transfers methyl groups to conserved glutamine residues on WspA. The demethylase WspF serves to remove these groups when in the phosphorylated active form.

It uses sequence length as a proxy for mutational target size, but ignores genetic organisation, function of predicted proteins and interaction among proteins. The model assumes that mutational target size is proportional to the number of nucleotides at a given locus and thus the probability that a given pathway is used to generate WS relative to another is simply the ratio of the probability of generating WS for the two focal pathways. For any one pathway the probability that a mutation generates WS is given by 1-(1-<italic>p</italic>)<italic><sup>n</sup></italic>, where <italic>p</italic> is the probability of a mutation at a nucleotide and <italic>n</italic> is the number of nucleotides in the pathway.

Knowing whether a WS-type is generated by a particular mutation amounts to determining which reaction rates are altered by the mutation and whether those changes affect the likelihood of producing WS types. This leads to an approach where mutations in components can be classified according to their effects on reaction rates: <italic>enabling</italic> mutations increase reaction rates, whereas <italic>disabling</italic> mutations decrease reaction rates.</p><p>Based on the mathematical models for the pathways, each reaction rate can be altered (either increased or decreased) to generate higher levels of the key WS effector (the active DGC). For example, in the Wsp pathway, if reactions 2 or 6 experience a disabling mutation, or alternatively, if any of the reactions 1, 3, 4, or 5 experience an enabling mutation, then the level of activated (phosphorylated) WspR is increased. For now, it is assumed that increased activity of the relevant DGC generates a WS type. Reactions whose enabling/disabling mutations increase the amount of WS effector are termed enabling/disabling reactions.</p><p>By comparing the number of disabling and enabling reactions in different pathways it is possible to calculate the relative likelihood that evolution uses each mutational pathway. The Wsp pathway encompasses two disabling and four enabling reactions, whereas the Aws pathway is defined by one disabling and three enabling reactions. Mws encompasses a single disabling reaction and two enabling reactions. If disabling mutations are as likely as enabling mutations, then the likelihood that a pathway will be used by evolution is simply the ratio of the total number of enabling and disabling reactions: 6:4:3 (Wsp:Aws:Mws). If instead, disabling mutations are much more likely than enabling mutations, then enabling reactions can be ignored and the likelihood that a pathway will be used by evolution becomes simply the ratio of the number of disabling reactions: 2:1:1 (Wsp:Aws:Mws) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> left hand panel). If the reverse is true, then the likelihood of use is a ratio of the number of enabling reactions: 4:3:2 (Wsp:Aws:Mws) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> right hand panel). In all cases, mutations in the Wsp pathway are predicted to be 1.3&#x02013;2 times more likely to generate WS than mutations in the Aws pathway, with the Aws pathway being the target of evolution 1&#x02013;1.5 times more often than the Mws pathway. Although still inflating the importance of the Wsp pathway relative to Aws, Mws is more prominent than in null Model II.</p><p>Null Model IV takes a further step toward mechanistic accuracy by endowing interactions with pleiotropic and continuous effects. This removes two simplifying assumptions of null Model III likely to limit predictive power. In Model III mutations affect one reaction at a time, but mutations in certain components, for example <italic>wspA</italic>, can&#x000a0;affect more than a single reaction (WspA appears in reactions 1&#x02013;4). Additionally, in Model III, changes in reaction rate are assumed to be binary, however reactions may have a range of effects on the evolution of WS types.</p><p>To accommodate pleiotropic effects, null Model IV systematically considers all combinations of enabling and disabling changes to reaction rates and determines the likelihood that a WS type is generated. An example of one set of the possible mutations (<italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic>) in Wsp is 1,&#x02013;1, 0, 0, 0, 0 (an increase in <italic>r<sub>1</sub></italic>, a decrease in <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic>, but no change in <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>4</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>5</sub></italic>, or <italic>r<sub>6</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>)). Since the Wsp pathway has six reaction rates this amounts to 3<sup>6</sup> or 729 total combinations. However, note that reaction 3 does not share any reactants or products with reactions 5 or 6. Thus, mutations such as 0, 0, 1, 0,&#x000a0;1, 0 or 0, 0,&#x000a0;1, 0, 0, 1 are not considered because they require mutations in two separate genetic components.</p><p>To accommodate a range of effects null Model IV simulates enabling/disabling changes of different magnitudes and determines the resulting effect on the respective effector DGC (see Materials and methods). Briefly, the approach addresses the lack of information concerning biochemical reaction rates and molecular concentrations in the mathematical models describing WS-producing pathway dynamics. By repeatedly sampling from the space of all possible reaction rates, initial concentrations, and magnitudes of effects, this approach computes the probability that a particular set of mutations (<italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic>), for&#x000a0;example&#x000a0;1,&#x02013;1, 0, 0, 0, 0, results in a wrinkly spreader. This probability is represented as the conditional probability <italic>P</italic> (<italic>WS</italic> |<italic>m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp</italic>), which motivates a Bayesian formulation to compare the relative probability that the different pathways produce WS. To this end, the probability that a particular pathway will be used is decomposed into two terms: the probability that a particular set of mutations (<italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic>) occurs in Wsp (or Aws, or Mws) represented as <italic>P</italic> (<italic>m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp</italic>) and the probability that those mutations give rise to a wrinkly spreader represented as <italic>P</italic> (<italic>WS</italic> |<italic>m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp</italic>) (or Aws, or Mws).<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02229;</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02229;</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo movablelimits="false">&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x02208;</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To estimate <italic>P</italic> (<italic>m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp</italic>) we assume fixed probabilities of enabling and disabling changes and compute the product.

Predictions as to specific genetic targets come from appraisal of the relative importance of each reaction in terms of generating WS types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). While it is recognised that a majority of WS mutations arise from defects in negative regulators of DGCs, such as WspF and AwsX (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>), further predictions are possible based on impacts of alterations in gene function on reaction rates. For example, with reference to the Wsp pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>), there are two reactions (2 and 6) that are&#x000a0;affected&#x000a0;by WspF function: <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> describes the rate of removal of methyl groups from the WspA&#x000a0;signalling complex and <italic>r<sub>6</sub></italic> the rate at which WspF is activated by transfer of active phosphoryl groups from the WspE kinase. Loss-of-function (disabling) mutations being much more common than gain-of-function (enabling) mutations means that WspF,&#x000a0;WspA and WspE are all&#x000a0;likely targets. The null model predicts that in the area of parameter space in which Wsp is most likely compared to Aws, 45% of the time WS will be generated when the second reaction, <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic>, is altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). The same is true for reaction r<sub>6</sub>. Thus the presence of a negative regulator is predicted to extend the mutational target size well beyond the gene itself. This is also true for Aws, where <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic> is the main contributor to the WS phenotype in the case where disabling change is more common than enabling change. Here mutations are predicted not only in the negative regulator AwsX, but also in the interacting region of the DGC AwsR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators and their interacting partners are not the only predicted targets. For Wsp <italic>r<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic>, <italic>r<sub>4</sub></italic>, and <italic>r<sub>5</sub></italic> are altered approximately 5% of the time in the parameter region where disabling mutations are more common than enabling mutations, but contribute more when the rate of enabling mutations is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>).

At least 41 different mutations in Aws lead to WS: if mutation rates were equal for these sites the probability of observing 20 identical mutations would be extremely small. In fact 10 million random samplings from the observed distribution of mutations failed to recover this bias. While the Wsp pathway also contains sites that were mutated more than once (six positions were mutated twice, one site three times and one five times), sources of mutational bias in Wsp were less evident than in Aws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Incorporating mutational bias into null models</title><p>The mathematical models presented above assumed no mutational bias, but the null models can be modified to incorporate such bias.

If a mutation completely disables the negative regulator WspF, this will reduce <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>6</sub></italic>, thereby producing a wrinkly spreader. In other cases interpretations of likely effects are more difficult and requires knowledge of the molecular functions of the proteins and their interactions, which needs to be obtained from literature, bioinformatics and structural modelling. For example, mutations in WspA can potentially produce WS by disruption of the interaction with WspF (reducing <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic>), increase methylation by WspC (increasing <italic>r<sub>1</sub></italic>), increase signalling rate (<italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic>) or increase phosphorylation of WspE (<italic>r<sub>4</sub></italic>). A summary of the interpretation of the molecular effects of mutations and how they are connected to reaction rates is available in <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with a more detailed description in Appendix 1.</p><p>Mutations were found in five genes in the Wsp pathway. The majority of the mutations were found in the negative regulator WspF or its interacting partners WspE and WspA. These mutations likely reduced reaction rates of <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>6</sub></italic> in accord with predictions of null Model IV. The remaining mutations in WspC and WspR were less common, in accord with predictions and likely due to increases in reaction rates r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>5</sub>, respectively. Results for the Aws pathway were also in line with predictions with the majority of the mutations arising in the negative regulator AwsX or the interacting part of AwsR (both decreasing <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic>), with rare mutations in AwsO and other parts of AwsR. For MwsR, loss-of-function mutations were expected primarily in the phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain, but mutations were found in both diguanylate cyclase&#x000a0;(DGC)&#x000a0;and PDE domains. A structural analysis revealed that mutations were clustered in the interface between the domains and unlikely to disrupt PDE function. These mutations most likely change the dynamics between the DGC&#x000a0;and&#x000a0;EAL domains in a way that increases production of c-di-GMP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differences of mutational spectra with and without selection</title><p>The null models &#x02013; and especially null Model IV &#x02013; successfully predicted the mutational targets and explained mutation rates to WS when knowledge of mutational hot spots was included.

Recent interest has been sparked by an increasing number of observations that both phenotypic and molecular evolution, under certain circumstances, can be remarkably repeatable (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Shindo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Marx, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>), but whether these cases are representative for evolutionary processes in general remains to be determined. A related question, with greater potential for practical applications, is whether it is possible to forecast short-term evolutionary events and if so, then the challenge is to stipulate the data necessary to make successful predictions.</p><p>Our uniquely detailed knowledge of the WS experimental evolution system has provided a rare opportunity to determine the contributions of mutational bias and genetic architecture to the generation of new adaptive phenotypes, and consequently explore the limits of evolutionary forecasting. A thorough understanding of the function of the molecular species and their interactions allowed development of null models (see especially Model IV) that capture essential features of the genotype-to-phenotype map sufficient to predict the relative likelihood that evolution will follow each of the three principle pathways, along with specific mutational (genetic) targets. Even the most sophisticated of these models failed to forecast outcomes that matched the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, however, the reason became apparent upon characterisation of the set of WS mutants obtained without selection: the presence of mutational hotspots. Armed with knowledge of sources of mutational bias it was a simple matter to refine Model IV leading to predictions matching those observed by experiment.</p><p>Problematic at the current time is inability to <italic>a priori</italic> detect all causes of mutational bias, however, it is likely that this will improve as understanding of the biochemical causes of bias improves and algorithms trained to recognise and detect nucleotide patterns indicative of bias are implemented. One specific deletion (&#x00394;Y77-Q87) in <italic>awsX</italic> was found to account for nearly half (20/41) of the mutations in the Aws pathway. Thus, despite the existence of hundreds of possible mutations leading to WS (this work and (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>)) one single mutation accounts for more than one quarter of all WS mutations. While the six base pair direct repeat flanking the deletion provides a convincing explanation for its increased rate, it is not clear why this deletion would be ten times more common than the &#x00394;P34-A46 deletion in the same gene that is flanked by ten base pair repeats and contains five base pairs identical to those from the &#x00394;Y77-Q87 deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6&#x02014;source data 1</xref>). There are also instances where single base pair substitutions are overrepresented: the AwsR T27P mutation is found in nine cases, while eight other single pair substitutions in Aws were found only once. Consider further the fact that <italic>wspE</italic> (a gene of&#x000a0;~2.3 kb), where changes to only four specific amino acids repeatedly cause WS, and <italic>wspF</italic> (a gene of&#x000a0;~1 kb) where any mutation that disrupts function results in WS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) contribute equally to the rates of at which new WS types arise.</p><p>It is evident from these findings and from related studies (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Pollock and Larkin, 2004</xref>) that there is need for detailed experimental measurement of local mutation rates in specific systems. Such investigations stand to contribute to understanding of the causes of mutational bias and the extent to which biases might be conserved among related or even unrelated organisms. If local nucleotide sequence is the major determinant, an estimate of mutation rate will apply strictly to very closely related species, but if the dynamics of molecular processes, such as transcription and replication (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Sankar et al., 2016</xref>), are major influences then estimates might be applicable to a wider range of species.</p><p>Forecasting mutational routes to new phenotypes is one component of a comprehensive forecasting strategy. The second requirement is ability to <italic>a priori</italic> predict fitness effects. Solving this problem is the Holy Grail for predicting evolution, but at the current time this is not possible. That it matters is made clear by the observation that a subset of all possible WS mutants was found after experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) due to inability of some to successfully compete with high fitness WS types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Direct measurement of the fitness effects of large numbers of mutations is difficult, time-consuming, typically only possible for microbial species and against the spirit of identifying <italic>a priori</italic> predictors of fitness effects.

Possibilities likely also exist to extrapolate findings from a small number of mutations that are either directly constructed and assayed in the laboratory or through fitness estimates of polymorphism data from natural populations. Recent work on the prediction of the fitness effects of random mutations in several genes suggests that in many cases large effect mutations can be predicted using methods based on evolutionary conservation (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>On a less ambitious scale it may be possible to take advantage of the fact that the distribution of fitness effects associated with mutations in single genes is often bimodal &#x02013; a consequence of many mutations causing complete loss-of-function rather than intermediate deleterious; effects (<xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuan, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hietpas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Jacquier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Firnberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lundin et al., 2017</xref>). As such it may&#x000a0;be sufficient to know gene function plus consequences arising from loss of function mutations and thus treat mutations within single genes as having equivalent fitness (<xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuan, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Jacquier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2017a</xref>). Interestingly WS mutations occurring in the same gene typically show similar fitness effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While still requiring experimental data, this simplification may fuel exploration of the relationship between large numbers of mutations and their fitness effects and thus understanding of the extent to which fitness effects are transferable between strains with different genetic backgrounds or closely related species (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Ungerer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Taken at face value, our findings give reason to question the value of aspiring to forecast evolution from first principles based on mechanistic understanding. But we argue against such pessimism and point firstly to the value that stems from a clear understanding of current limitations on forecasting: defining what is known, what is not known, and what needs to be known. That it is possible to take knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype map and forecast with good accuracy targets and rates is an important advance. There is good reason to suspect that the principles outlined here and previously (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lind et al., 2015</xref>) are transferable to other systems and even generalizable (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Lind, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Evolutionary forecasting is in its infancy. In the short term it is likely to be most successful for biological systems where there are experimental data on a large number of independent evolutionary events, such as is the case for influenza, HIV and cancer (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Kouyos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Luksza and L&#x000e4;ssig, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Neher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Eirew et al., 2015</xref>). Evolution might appear idiosyncratic indicating that every specific system requires detailed investigation, but our hope is that deeper knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype map, distribution of fitness effects and mutational biases will allow short term forecasts to be produced using modelling without the need for large-scale experimental studies. A major boost to further refinement of evolutionary forecasting is likely to come from combining coarse (top down) and fine-grained (bottom-up) approaches. Our demonstration that simple null models of functional networks can produce quantitative predictions is a step forward allowing predictions to be directly tested in other experimental systems (<xref

Viable counts were estimated by serial dilution and plating on KB agar. One randomly chosen colony per independent culture with WS colony morphology was restreaked once on KB agar. The assay was repeated at least four times for the double deletion mutants and twice for the wild type strain in order to obtain enough mutants to allow estimation of mutation rates. Mutations rates and confidence intervals were estimated using the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar Maximum Likelihood Estimator (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 2009</xref>) available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.keshavsingh.org/protocols/FALCOR.html.">www.keshavsingh.org/protocols/FALCOR.html.</ext-link> The mutation rates between the different strains were statistically evaluated using a t-test as previously described (<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Rosche and Foster, 2000</xref>), but this method has only been shown to be valid in cases where total population size is not significantly different for the strains used. In our assay this was not the case, as determined by ANOVA, and therefore the results of the statistical analysis should be interpreted with caution. As the estimated number of mutants per well was&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.5 for all strains, the biasing effect of differences in fitness between WS mutants is minimal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sequencing</title><p>Mutations causing the WS phenotype were identified by Sanger sequencing of candidate genes in the remaining common pathway to WS, for example the <italic>wsp</italic> operon for the <italic>aws</italic>/<italic>mws</italic> deletion strain.

We used a WspF &#x00394;T226-G275 deletion mutant as the reference strain because WspF mutants are the most commonly found WS type when grown under selective conditions (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>) and the in frame deletion of 50 amino acids most likely represents a complete loss-of-function mutation with minimal polar effects on the downstream <italic>wspR</italic>. Selection coefficients per generation were calculated as s = [ln(R(t)/R(0))]/[t], as previously described (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dykhuizen, 1990</xref>) where R is the ratio of alternative WS mutant to WspF &#x00394;T226-G275 GFP and t the number of generations. Viable counts on KB plates of initial and final populations were performed to calculate the number of generations. Stability of colony morphologies was confirmed and data from microcosms with&#x000a0;&#x0003e;5% smooth colonies were excluded (two cases). Control competition experiments with isogenic WspF &#x00394;T226-G275 reference strains with and without GFP were used to correct for the cost of the GFP marker. Control competitions were also used to determine the cost of the double deletions and the reporter construct relative to a wild type genetic background, for example an AwsX &#x00394;Y77-Q87 mutant in <italic>&#x00394;wsp</italic>/<italic>&#x00394;mws</italic> background with pMSC was competed with a GFP labeled AwsX &#x00394;Y77-Q87 mutant in wild type background.

In order to solve the differential equations, two pieces of information are required: (i) the initial concentrations of the molecular species and (ii) the reaction rates. Although this information is unavailable a random-sampling approach was used to generate different random sets of initial concentrations and reaction rates. Each random set was used to establish a baseline of potential WS expression making it possible to evaluate whether a set of mutations results in a WS type. Effectively, this approach allows sampling of the probability distribution <italic>P</italic> (<italic>WS</italic> |<italic>m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp</italic>) used in our Bayesian model.</p><p>We randomly sample 1000 different sets of reaction rates and initial concentrations from uniform priors: reaction rates were sampled randomly from a uniform distribution on log space (i.e. 10<sup>U[&#x02212;2,2]</sup>) and initial concentrations of reactants were sampled from a uniform distribution U[0,10]. For each set, the appropriate differential equation model was integrated and the steady state concentration of the compounds that correspond to a wrinkly spreader (RR in Aws, R* in Wsp and D* for Mws) computed. This served as a baseline for the non-WS phenotype that was used for comparison to determine whether combinations of mutations result in increased WS expression. After obtaining the baseline, we implemented particular combinations of enabling/disabling mutations (<italic>a m<sub>i</sub></italic>). Ideally, a distribution linking enabling/disabling mutations to a fold change in reaction rates would be used, but this information is unavailable. In order to progress the effect sizes for enabling and disabling mutations were sampled from 10<sup>U[0,2]</sup> and 10<sup>U[&#x02212;2,0]</sup>, respectively, and then multiplied by the reaction rates. The differential equations were then solved for the same time that it took the baseline to reach steady state. The final concentration of R* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), RR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and D* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) was then compared to the baseline and the number of times out of 1000 that the WS-inducing compound increased served as an estimate of <italic>P (WS|m<sub>i</sub> &#x02208; Wsp)</italic>. The probability distribution stabilized by 500 random samples and additional sampling did not produce significant changes (data not shown).</p><p>The absence of empirical data on reaction rates, initial concentrations, and expected mutation effect size meant using a random sampling approach requiring estimates for parameter ranges. Parameter ranges were chosen to be broad enough to capture differences spanning several orders of magnitudes while allowing numerical computations for solving the differential equations. To assess the effect of these ranges on the results, the sampling procedure was repeated for WSP for three different parameter regimes (i) an expanded range for initial concentrations [0&#x02013;50], (ii) an expanded range for reaction rates 10<sup>[-3,3]</sup>, (iii) a compressed range for mutational effect size 10^<sup>[-1,1]</sup>. This analysis shows that qualitative results are robust to these changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5&#x02014;figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Source code and equations are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="funding-information"><title>Funding Information</title><p>This paper was supported by the following grant:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>

The most commonly mutated gene was <italic>wspA</italic> (PFLU1219), with ten out&#x000a0;of 15 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) being amino acid substitutions (six unique) clustered in the region 352&#x02013;420 at the stalk of the signalling domain. This region has been implicated in trimer-of-dimer formation for the WspA homologue in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">O'Connor et al., 2012</xref>) which is critical for self-assembly and localization of Wsp clusters in the membrane. It is possible that these mutations stabilize trimer of dimer formation, change the subcellular location of the Wsp complex, or affect interaction with WspD (putative interface 383&#x02013;420 in WspA) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Griswold et al., 2002</xref>) and thus affecting relay of signal to WspE. These effects we interpreted as enabling mutations increasing <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. The four additional mutations were in frame deletions in a separate region of the transducer domain (&#x00394;T293 - E299, &#x00394;A281-A308). Although it is possible that these mutations could also affect trimer-of-dimer formation, there are predicted methylation sites in the region (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Dahlquist, 1991</xref>) that regulate the activity of the protein via methyltransferase WspC and methylesterase WspF. Given that disabling mutations are more common than enabling mutations it is likely that these mutations decrease <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> by disrupting the interaction with WspF. We also identified a single mutation that fused the open reading frame of WspC, the methyltransferase that positively regulates WspA activity, to WspD, resulting in a chimeric protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6&#x02014;source data 1</xref>). This mutation is likely to be a rare enabling mutation that increases the activity of WspC (increasing <italic>r<sub>1</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) by physically tethering it to the WspABD complex thus allowing it to more effectively counteract the negative regulator WspF. Alternatively, the tethering may physically block the interaction with WspF (decrease of <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The second most commonly mutated gene in the <italic>wsp</italic> operon was <italic>wspE</italic> (PFLU1223) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Four amino acids were repeatedly mutated in the response regulatory domain of WspE and all cluster closely in a structural homology model made with Phyre2 (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). All mutated residues surround the active site of the phosphorylated D682 and it is likely that they disrupt feedback regulation by decreasing phosphorylation of the negative regulator WspF (decreasing r<sub>6</sub>) rather than increasing activation of WspR (<italic>r<sub>5</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Twelve mutations were detected in <italic>wspF</italic> (PFLU1224). These are distributed throughout the gene and include amino acid substitutions, in-frame deletions as well as a frame-shift and a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The pattern of mutations is consistent with both the role of WspF as a negative regulator of WspA activity and the well-characterised effect of loss-of-function mutations in this gene (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bantinaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>). The mutations are interpreted as decreasing <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p>Five mutations were found in WspR (PFLU1225), the DGC output response regulator that produces c-di-GMP and activates expression of cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All mutations were located in the linker region between the response regulator and DGC domains. Mutations in this region are known to generate constitutively active <italic>wspR</italic> alleles by relieving the requirement for phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Goymer et al., 2006</xref>). They may additionally affect subcellular clustering of WspR (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Huangyutitham et al., 2013</xref>) or shift the equilibrium between the dimeric form of WspR, with low basal activity, towards a tetrameric activated form (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">De et al., 2009</xref>). In our model these increase reaction <italic>r<sub>5</sub></italic>.</p><p><italic>Aws pathway</italic>: Mutations were identified in all three genes of the Aws pathway &#x02013; all of which were predicted by the null Model&#x000a0;IV. In the Aws pathway, mutations were most commonly found in <italic>awsX</italic> (25 out of 41 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The above-mentioned mutational hotspot produced in-frame deletions likely mediated by 6 bp direct repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6&#x02014;source data 1</xref>). The deletions are consistent with a loss of function and a decrease in <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) that would leave the partially overlapping open reading frame of the downstream gene (<italic>awsR</italic>) unaffected.</p><p>The DGC AwsR, was mutated in 14 cases with an apparent mutational hot spot at T27P (nine mutants) in a predicted transmembrane helix (amino acids 19&#x02013;41). The remaining mutations were amino acid substitutions in the HAMP linker and in the PAS-like periplasmic domain between the two transmembrane helices. These amino acid substitutions are distant to the output DGC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and their effects are difficult to interpret, but they could cause changes in dimerization (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2012</xref>) or the packing of HAMP domains, which could, in turn, alter transmission of conformational changes in the periplasmic PAS-like domain to the DGC domain causing constitutive activation (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Parkinson, 2010</xref>). Such effects would increase <italic>r<sub>4</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. Mutations in the N-terminal part of the protein are easier to interpret based on the existing functional model (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2012</xref>) and most likely disrupt interactions with the periplasmic negative regulator AwsX resulting in a decrease in <italic>r<sub>3</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>Two mutations were found in the outer membrane lipoprotein protein AwsO between the signal peptide and the OmpA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Both mutations were glutamine to proline substitutions (Q34P, Q40P), which together with a previously reported G42V mutation (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that multiple changes in this small region can cause a WS phenotype. This is also supported by data from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in which mutations in nine different positions in this region lead to a small colony variant phenotype similar to WS (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2012</xref>). A functional model based on the YfiBNR in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Malone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), suggest that AwsO sequesters AwsX at the outer membrane and that mutations in the N-terminal part of the protein lead to constitutive activation and increased binding of AwsX. This would correspond to an increase in <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, which would relieve negative regulation of AwsR.</p><p>Mws pathway: The MwsR pathway (comprising just a single gene) harbours mutations in both DGC and phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains. Mainly mutations in the C-terminal phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain were predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Eleven of 18 mutations were identical in-frame deletions (&#x00394;R1024-E1026) in the PDE domain, mediated by 8 bp direct repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6&#x02014;source data 1</xref>). It has been shown previously that deletion of the entire PDE domain generates the WS phenotype (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a negative regulatory role that causes a decrease of <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. One additional mutation was found in the PDE domain (E1083K) located close to R1024 in a structural homology model made with Phyre2 (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>), but distant to the active site residues (E1059-L1061). Previously reported mutations (A1018T, ins1089DV) (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>) are also distant from the active site and cluster in the same region in a structural homology model. This suggests that loss of phosphodiesterase activity may not be the mechanism leading to the WS phenotype. This is also supported by the high solvent accessibility of the mutated residues, which indicates that major stability-disrupting mutations are unlikely and changes in interactions between domains or dimerization are more probable. Thus, it is likely that the WS phenotype resulting from a deletion in the PDE domain is caused by disruption of domain interactions or dimerization rather than loss of phosphodiesterase activity.</p><p>The remaining mutations within <italic>mwsR</italic> are amino acid substitutions in the GGDEF domain, close to the DGC active site (G927-F931) with the exception of a duplication of I978-G985. While it is possible that these mutations directly increase the catalytic activity of the DGC, increasing <italic>r<sub>1</sub></italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, such enabling mutations are considered to be rare. An alternative hypothesis is that these mutations either interfere with c-di-GMP feedback regulation or produce larger conformational changes that change inter-domain or inter-dimer interactions, similar to the mutations in the PDE domain. Based on these data we reject the current model of Mws function, which predicted mutations decreasing <italic>r<sub>2</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) through mutations inactivating the PDE domain. We instead suggest that the mutations are likely to disrupt the conformational dynamics between the domains and could be seen either as activating mutations causing constitutive activation or disabling mutations with much reduced mutational target size that must specifically disrupt the interaction surface between the domains. In both cases the previous model leads to an overestimation of the rate to WS for the Mws pathway.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article id="SA1" article-type="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38822.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wittkopp</surname><given-names>Patricia J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been reviewed by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Bull (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Overall, we were impressed by the experimental data presented, but had concerns about the predictions and model testing. These concerns included both the clarity of presentation and the substance of the modeling. Different reviewers had different interpretations of some elements of the work because key elements (including Figure 3) were not clearly explained. The mutation model was one element identified as particularly difficult to understand. The lack of statistical tests comparing the predictions to data was also identified as a missing element. Especially in light of the title of the paper; making sure these predictions are made and tested appropriately, is key - we agree that this is where some of the most exciting aspects of the paper lie. Critical points raised during our discussion are provided below. Minimally, we request that you make it clear that you are evaluating two different prediction models and clarify them. Ideally, we'd also like you to make the evolution model explicit and quantitative as well as evaluate each model separately by computing numerical predictions and reporting statistics on the fit with results.</p><p>We recognize that the refinement of the modeling work we are requesting may be substantial.

We appreciated the study's span of known biochemical pathways for a phenotype, of documented mutations and mutation counts in those pathways leading to that phenotype, and the attempt to model/quantify the mutation rates in light of some genomic details. The topic is of sufficient interest to publish in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) A major strength of the study was that there is an in-depth analysis of different mutational pathways to the WS phenotype. This is a data-intensive part of the paper with lots of detail about gene identity of mutations that were found in WS mutants. However, descriptions of gene functions would be better presented in a table with the in text discussion streamlined more.</p><p>2) A much better description of Figure 3 is needed. Not only are the colors not explained, but the meaning of the arrows isn't given either (are they quantitative, qualitative; how do they plug into the model?). I thus cannot easily understand how the figure connects to their models. We ultimately found this information in the supplementary materials, but the reader shouldn't need to look there to understand this key element of the paper. As one reviewer wrote: the manuscript describes Figure 3 as a diagram of a "pathway" or "molecular network" but it does not use ordinary conventions for biochemical or regulatory pathways. It is better described as a graph of mathematical dependencies between reaction rates (red) and gene-product concentrations (blue). Once you know this, you can read out some of the implied reactions like F + E* ==(r6)==&#x0003e; E + F*. In the supplement, see reaction 6, Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1, "Phosphorylated WspE can phosphorylate WspF". It would be more understandable to just list the reactions, I think.</p><p>3) Most importantly, we felt that the modeling elements were presented superficially and were not well-integrated. There are two different prediction models developed and evaluated in the paper: one of mutation rates and one of evolutionary tendencies. Regarding mutational predictability, we have (1) a model for predicting relative mutability for 3 pathways, (2) measured mutation rates for the 3 pathways, and (3) a revised model. But there are no statistics telling us how well the model fits and how much it was improved.</p><p>In theoretical population genetics there is a simple "origin-fixation" or SSWM framework for considering the relative chances of different discrete evolutionary changes. Whether or not one wishes to criticize this formalism for being too simplistic, it is the obvious framework for making a prediction when one has measured mutation rates and selection coefficients. It allows precise quantitative statements about the relative contributions of selection and mutational heterogeneity to parallel evolution, as per "What drives parallel evolution?" by Bailey et al., 2017, which uses the theory explained more thoroughly in "Parallel evolution: what does it (not) tell us and why is it (still) interesting?" by Lenormand et al., 2016. The analysis also needs statistical tests, e.g., tests of differences where the authors are making claims about differences.</p><p>Regarding the modeling framework, let me explain this concretely. The relevant facts on mutation rate, selection coefficient, and frequency evolved are (subsection &#x0201c;Obtaining an unbiased measure of pathway-specific mutation rates to WS&#x0201d;, Figure 6 and Figure 7):</p><p>Wsp: u = 3.7E-9; s ~ x; E = 15</p><p>Aws: u = 6.5E-9; s ~ x &#x02013; 0.2; E = 7</p><p>Mws: u = 7.4E-10; s ~ x &#x02013; 0.05; E = 3</p><p>Here x is the selection coefficient of the WspF control used in growth competitions, and I have estimated s by eye from Figure 6.</p><p>The authors talk about predictability, but they do not compute a prediction using a model, nor compute the fit between results and predictions. One way to do this is to invoke origin-fixation dynamics, yielding 3 relative predictions of u * Pr_fixation(s), which can be compared to the 3 E values using a chi-squared test (or, better, define expected Wsp and Aws as sums over the 5 and 3 relevant gene targets). Given all the numbers and Kimura's formula for Pr_fixation(s, N), this can be done in a spreadsheet in 15 minutes.</p><p>If the authors do not want to commit to the assumptions underlying origin-fixation dynamics, they can just do a multinomial regression on the assumption that E(p) = f(u_p, s_p) where p is the pathway.</p><p>In summary, we all agreed that under the origin-fixation framework, having estimates of mutation rates for different phenotypes is important and that these are not easy to obtain in most systems. We are excited about the opportunity to test how well a model based on known information can recapitulate observed mutation rates. It is interesting that it does a relatively poor job unless they incorporate information about mutational hotspots. We think that making this analysis more formal in addition to formally testing your evolutionary predictions using an origin-fixation framework (or similar approach) would both strengthen the paper and be in the spirit of what the title claims the paper does.</p><p>[Editors&#x02019; note: formal revisions were requested, following approval of the authors&#x02019; plan of action.]</p><p>Thank you for describing your proposed revisions. This summary has been reviewed and discussed by the reviewers and myself. We all agree that your proposed responses to everything except point 3 is satisfactory. For point 3, the reviewers were disappointed in the response. They all agreed that their recommendation to take advantage of your rich and powerful dataset to model the evolutionary process more formally had been dismissed too quickly.</p><p>After considering your response and their comments, it seems to me that you are thinking about "predictability" in the way that David Stern does (i.e., which genes/pathways are most likely to be changed to give rise to a particular phenotypic change given the molecular/developmental functions of all genes in the genome), and they are thinking about predictability in a more population/quantitative genetics sense (i.e., given that you know the relative mutation rates and fitness effects for different genes, you should be able to make predictions using theoretical models about how the trait should evolve, which you can then compare to the observed data). In the reviewers&#x02019; opinion, you are focused more on the effects of mutations as they arise and they want to see these combined with other evolutionary forces to make more robust evolutionary predictions.</p><p>I do not want to be so heavy handed in the review process as to try force you to make your paper something you didn't intend it to be. However, I also see the potential for modeling with your data that has the reviewers excited. It is rare to have the type of data that you have, and there are well-developed models that could make your data even more impactful.</p><p>Ultimately, I will leave it up to you to decide whether or not to go beyond the response you propose and fit a specific evolutionary model and compare it to your observed data with statistical tests. If you choose not to do this, however, it is essential that the title, abstract, and other parts of the paper are modified so that readers do not think this type of analysis is included within the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="SA2" article-type="reply"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38822.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors&#x02019; note: what follows is the authors&#x02019; plan to address the revisions.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, we were impressed by the experimental data presented, but had concerns about the predictions and model testing.

It will also allow more attention to be given to the proposed effects of mutations on gene function and reaction rates and their agreement (or not) with the model. However, in removing this information to a table we are concerned that we may leave the reader interested in important detail frustrated. To accommodate this possibility we propose including a supplementary text that complements the table in which we will include relevant detail and where necessary, nuanced interpretations (removed from the current text).

Not only are the colors not explained, but the meaning of the arrows isn't given either (are they quantitative, qualitative; how do they plug into the model?). I thus cannot easily understand how the figure connects to their models. We ultimately found this information in the supplementary materials, but the reader shouldn't need to look there to understand this key element of the paper. As one reviewer wrote: the manuscript describes Figure 3 as a diagram of a "pathway" or "molecular network" but it does not use ordinary conventions for biochemical or regulatory pathways. It is better described as a graph of mathematical dependencies between reaction rates (red) and gene-product concentrations (blue). Once you know this, you can read out some of the implied reactions like F + E* ==(r6)==&#x0003e; E + F*. In the supplement, see reaction 6, Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1, "Phosphorylated WspE can phosphorylate WspF". It would be more understandable to just list the reactions, I think.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a better description of Figure 3 is required. In response to your point 3 (below) we propose to include null models for each of the pathways. These will allow a better introduction / motivation and description of our mathematical model that will lead to a revision of Figure 3. We will take care to ensure that the caption serves as a complete description of the figure and its significance. This will require one month.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Most importantly, we felt that the modeling elements were presented superficially and were not well-integrated. There are two different prediction models developed and evaluated in the paper: one of mutation rates and one of evolutionary tendencies. Regarding mutational predictability, we have (1) a model for predicting relative mutability for 3 pathways, (2) measured mutation rates for the 3 pathways, and (3) a revised model. But there are no statistics telling us how well the model fits and how much it was improved.</p><p>In theoretical population genetics there is a simple "origin-fixation" or SSWM framework for considering the relative chances of different discrete evolutionary changes. Whether or not one wishes to criticize this formalism for being too simplistic, it is the obvious framework for making a prediction when one has measured mutation rates and selection coefficients. It allows precise quantitative statements about the relative contributions of selection and mutational heterogeneity to parallel evolution, as per "What drives parallel evolution?" by Bailey et al., 2017, which uses the theory explained more thoroughly in "Parallel evolution: what does it (not) tell us and why is it (still) interesting?" by Lenormand et al., 2016. The analysis also needs statistical tests, e.g., tests of differences where the authors are making claims about differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have given this particular attention. It seems, especially from the suggestion that we borrow from origin-fixation models, there is some misunderstanding of what we have done: our motivation, aims and overall long-term aspiration. Clearly, we need to improve.</p><p>Ultimately &#x02013; although perhaps not for some time &#x02013; we think that it will be possible to take a given genome sequence and, armed with knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype map underpinning a particular phenotype, combined with knowledge of localised mutational biases, predict the genetic bases of phenotypic evolution in the absence of additional data. Our work is a small step in this direction and perhaps its most important contribution is to outline a way forward and uniquely (because of our experimental system) assess its validity in terms of what is currently known, what is not known, and what needs (in the future) to be known.</p><p>Importantly, our approach aids understanding of <italic>why</italic> evolution follows a particular route. Indeed in our previous work (McDonald et al.,2009; Lind et al.,2015) we have shown the genotype-to-phenotype map to be a significant contributor to parallel evolution (it&#x02019;s not all about selection and mutation rate). Our work thus contributes to development of a body of knowledge that deepens understanding of the mechanisms of evolution.</p><p>Our approach is readily extendable to other organisms that harbour Wsp, Aws and Mws pathways. Precisely this transferability is demonstrated in Lind 2018 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/08/342261). By extension to other systems, this stands to feedback to affect the value and predictive power of bottom-up approaches in the future. Further, our approach is amenable to the study of future evolutionary change, for example, that involving reverse evolution of the WS phenotype as evident in studies of lifecycle evolution (Hammerschmidt et al., 2014). In contrast, approaches involving measurement of mutation rate and selection coefficient will be &#x02014; in absence of mechanistic understanding &#x02014; specific to each particular instance of adaptive evolution.</p><p>We appreciate that origin-fixation models can be useful in predicting the rise and fixation of new mutants. As you and the referees point out such models require estimation of (1) the probability that a mutant will arise and (2) the selection coefficient of that mutant. These parameters, particularly the first, are difficult to predict a priori and usually require fitting to experimental data or an assumption about the probability distribution of mutations. The framework introduced in our paper is different, in that it attempts to estimate the probability that a particular mutant (Wsp, Aws, Mws) will arise in the absence of experimental data (with only knowledge of the genes in a pathway and how they interact to produce a particular phenotype). While we compare predictions arising from our models to experimental data, we do not use these data in our predictions.</p><p>Initially we make incorrect predictions based solely on knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype map (although we are not out by much) but show that we are able to refine predictions through incorporation of information concerning mutational hotspots. The capacity to weigh the influences of gene interactions with gene mutation rates avoids lumping these factors into a single term as is the norm for origin-fixation models. In the revised version of this paper, we propose to spell out these differences more clearly.</p><p>In addition to the comments above we believe that using an origin-fixation framework is not appropriate here. Although the selection coefficients could of course be used in combination with mutation rates to predict the probability of fixation this is not what we are trying to do, moreover to do so would be to mislead the reader. There are three reasons. Firstly, the fitness of WS is frequency-dependent and thus a mutant&#x02019;s selection coefficient is very different at the time it originates compared to when it is established at the air-liquid interface (Rainey and Travisano,1998; Lind et al.,2015). Secondly, the selection coefficient is also dependent on the frequency of other WS types and other phenotypes selected at the air-liquid interface (Lind et al., 2017, Ferguson et al.,2013). Thirdly, fitness in our study is measured against a <italic>wspF</italic> (WS) mutant and not the wild type ancestor, which is needed for use in origin-fixation models. In our experiment, it is not the case that fitness can be estimated by using s=x-0.2 for <italic>aws</italic> as suggested in the comments.</p><p>The way forward: we propose as a vehicle for improvement, inclusion of null models for each of the pathways in which we firstly ignore genetic architecture. This means the first line of prediction &#x02013; as to which pathway evolution will follow &#x02013; will be based solely on target size. Preliminary analyses show that these null models are hopelessly inaccurate. Next, as we better develop the argument for the importance of genetic architecture, we propose a set of three null models that incorporate genetic architecture with the same number of components and interactions but with randomly assigned architectures. Comparison between these arbitrary models and those informed by current knowledge can then be made &#x02013; and will be statistically appraised. Together these comparisons will demonstrate the value of incorporating valid architectural information. Finally, as we move to introduce known mutational bias into our models (based on our experimental data) we will compare these to null models where the hotspot is placed randomly in the pathway. Again, we will subject the comparisons to statistical testing. The proposed new analyses will lead to clarifications in the Introduction and Discussion concerning our objectives and the differences with current approaches and particularly the difference between our strategy and origin-fixation models.</p><p>This analysis will be completed within two months and will offer many points of comparison and demonstrate the value of the predictive power of our approach.</p><p>Additionally, we propose: (1) to perform a statistical analysis of differences between all mutation rates (Figure 2) and fitness (for example <italic>wspA</italic> and <italic>wspR</italic> vs. the control in Figure 6). The number of replicates will be added to all figures. (2) Provide a better motivation for our measurements of fitness: an explanation of why mutations in certain genes have not previously been found (<italic>wspA</italic> and <italic>wspE</italic>) and why Aws is is more rarely used than Wsp despite a higher mutation rate to WS. (3) Add information concerning controls for fitness assays in order to account for effects of the kanamycin marker and double deletions and clarify that the number of mutants per independent culture for the mutation rate assay is &#x0003c;0.5 so that differences in fitness between different WS mutants thus making the point that these have minimal influence on results. These modifications will be completed within a month.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the modeling framework, let me explain this concretely. The relevant facts on mutation rate, selection coefficient, and frequency evolved are (subsection &#x0201c;Obtaining an unbiased measure of pathway-specific mutation rates to WS&#x0201d;, Figure 6 and Figure 7):</p><p>Wsp: u = 3.7E-9; s ~ x; E = 15</p><p>Aws: u = 6.5E-9; s ~ x &#x02013; 0.2; E = 7</p><p>Mws: u = 7.4E-10; s ~ x &#x02013; 0.05; E = 3</p><p>Here x is the selection coefficient of the WspF control used in growth competitions, and I have estimated s by eye from Figure 6.</p><p>The authors talk about predictability, but they do not compute a prediction using a model, nor compute the fit between results and predictions. One way to do this is to invoke origin-fixation dynamics, yielding 3 relative predictions of u * Pr_fixation(s), which can be compared to the 3 E values using a chi-squared test (or, better, define expected Wsp and Aws as sums over the 5 and 3 relevant gene targets). Given all the numbers and Kimura's formula for Pr_fixation(s, N), this can be done in a spreadsheet in 15 minutes.</p><p>If the authors do not want to commit to the assumptions underlying origin-fixation dynamics, they can just do a multinomial regression on the assumption that E(p) = f(u_p, s_p) where p is the pathway.</p><p>In summary, we all agreed that under the origin-fixation framework, having estimates of mutation rates for different phenotypes is important and that these are not easy to obtain in most systems. We are excited about the opportunity to test how well a model based on known information can recapitulate observed mutation rates. It is interesting that it does a relatively poor job unless they incorporate information about mutational hotspots. We think that making this analysis more formal in addition to formally testing your evolutionary predictions using an origin-fixation framework (or similar approach) would both strengthen the paper and be in the spirit of what the title claims the paper does.</p></disp-quote><p>[Editors&#x02019; notes: the authors&#x02019; response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for describing your proposed revisions. This summary has been reviewed and discussed by the reviewers and myself. We all agree that your proposed responses to everything except point 3 is satisfactory. For point 3, the reviewers were disappointed in the response. They all agreed that their recommendation to take advantage of your rich and powerful dataset to model the evolutionary process more formally had been dismissed too quickly.</p><p>After considering your response and their comments, it seems to me that you are thinking about "predictability" in the way that David Stern does (i.e., which genes/pathways are most likely to be changed to give rise to a particular phenotypic change given the molecular/developmental functions of all genes in the genome), and they are thinking about predictability in a more population/quantitative genetics sense (i.e., given that you know the relative mutation rates and fitness effects for different genes, you should be able to make predictions using theoretical models about how the trait should evolve, which you can then compare to the observed data). In the reviewers&#x02019; opinion, you are focused more on the effects of mutations as they arise and they want to see these combined with other evolutionary forces to make more robust evolutionary predictions.</p><p>I do not want to be so heavy handed in the review process as to try force you to make your paper something you didn't intend it to be. However, I also see the potential for modeling with your data that has the reviewers excited. It is rare to have the type of data that you have, and there are well-developed models that could make your data even more impactful.</p><p>Ultimately, I will leave it up to you to decide whether or not to go beyond the response you propose and fit a specific evolutionary model and compare it to your observed data with statistical tests. If you choose not to do this, however, it is essential that the title, abstract, and other parts of the paper are modified so that readers do not think this type of analysis is included within the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to &#x0201c;Predicting mutational routes to new adaptive phenotypes&#x0201d;. This we have done after realizing that our previous title gave the unintended message that we were combining mutation and selection into our model of evolutionary forecasting. This, as the referees have correctly understood, is not what we have done. What we have done (by virtue of being able to obtain a set of mutants with and without selection) is to show that there really is a need to link mutations to their fitness effects. We have made sure that this message is consistently made in the Abstract and elsewhere. In the revised Discussion section we emphasize that construction of models that link mutations to their fitness effects is the yet to be achieved Holy Grail of forecasting.</p><p>We have added new material to the Introduction to acknowledge origin-fixation models. We point out briefly their limitations, but importantly, we make clear that what we aspire to is quite different. Our hope is that at some future time it will be possible to read a genome sequence and be able to forecast future evolutionary change based on mechanistic understanding of rules underpinning expression of the phenotype from genotype, knowledge of mutational biases and understanding of the connection between mutations and their fitness effects, just as today we use the genome to interrogate various databases to infer much about gene function and regulation.</p><p>We have removed from the text the detailed descriptions of the likely effect of mutations on reaction rates of each pathway &#x02013; leaving just a short summary &#x02013; and placed this in Table 1.</p><p>We have substantially revised the modeling section as per our proposed plan. Specifically, in order to show the thinking behind our modeling approach we have included three new models, that begin with a simple (and intentionally na&#x000ef;ve) expression of the relationship between genotype and the probability of generating WS phenotypes and conclude with a comprehensive model that expresses the relationship between genotype and WS phenotype based on interaction rates among pathway components (the model previously presented). We describe this as a graph of mathematical dependencies and provide full details of the models in terms of functional descriptions and system of differential equations in the child figures (Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 1, Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 2 and Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 3). We have also clarified the use of multiple changes to reaction rates by single mutations and modified the model to disregard multiple changes that are likely to require several mutations. This has led to minor changes in the ratios of the different pathways and in also in the Figure 4 (now Figure 5), but they do not change our conclusions.</p><p>We have added a new Figure 3 showing the predictions of the different null models compared to the experimental data.</p><p>The complex graph depicting interactions among pathway components (previously Figure 3), is now Figure 4 and we have taken care to explain its significance fully both in the text and in the caption.</p><p>A new Figure 7 has been added that presents an analysis of the results of the different models the experimentally supported mutational hotspot and the predicted relationship between mutation and likelihood of generating WS via each of the three focal pathways. For the two comprehensive models we include the range of predicted states arising from extremes of all enabling and all disabling reactions allowing the reader to assess the full range of predictions and not just values from a single hotspot as previously. This was previously Figure 4D,E and part of the Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 2B.</p><p>We have reorganized the end of the Results section to make it clear to the reader that we do not attempt to predict the outcome of experimental evolution using mutation rates and selection coefficients. Instead we now first present the differences in mutational spectrum with and without selection. We have provided a better motivation for the fitness assays, which is to provide an explanation for these differences. We show that there are significant differences in fitness between different mutants and that the direction of these fitness differences explains the underrepresentation of certain types of mutations in the experimental evolution data thus highlighting the importance of incorporating selection in forecasting evolution. We deal with the origin-fixation framework in the Introduction (see above) touching on various assumptions, in particular the need for interactions between mutants to show no frequency dependence. As our decades long experience with the WS system has shown that it is replete with frequency dependent interactions we make no further mention in the Results section. To attempt to place our data in context of origin-fixation models would constitute misuse of the fitness data.</p><p>We have included statistical tests for all claims of differences as well as number of replicates. A table of key resources has been added to the Results section. Information about controls for fitness assays have been added to the methods section and we have clarified that the number of mutants per independent culture is so low that differences in fitness between different WS mutants will have minimal influence on results.</p><p>Finally, we have substantially revised the Discussion section with much clearer focus on the issues surrounding mechanistic (bottom-up) evolutionary forecasting.</p></body></sub-article></article>
