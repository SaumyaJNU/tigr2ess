    "BACKGROUND:In diverse plant taxa, whole-genome duplication (WGD) events are major sources of phenotypic novelty. Studies of gene expression in synthetic polyploids have shown immediate expression and functional partitioning of duplicated genes among different tissues. Many studies of the tissue-specific homeolog expression partitioning have focused on allopolyploids that have very different parental genomes, while few studies have focused on autopolyploids or allopolyploids that have similar parental genomes. RESULTS:In this study, we used a set of reciprocal F1 hybrids and synthetic tetraploids constructed from subspecies (japonica and indica) of Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) as a model to gain insights into the expression partitioning of homeologs among tissues in a developmental context. We assayed the tissue-specific silencing (TSS) of the parental homeologs of 30 key genes in the hybrids and tetraploids relative to the in vitro \"hybrids\" (parental mixes) using Sequenom MassARRAY. We found that the parental mix and synthetic tetraploids had higher frequencies of homeolog TSS than the F1, revealing an instantaneous role of WGD on homeolog expression partitioning. CONCLUSIONS:Our observations contradicted those of previous studies in which newly formed allopolyploids had a low TSS frequency, similar to that of F1 hybrids, suggesting that the impact of WGD on homeolog expression requires a longer time to manifest. In addition, we found that the TSS frequency in the tetraploids varied at different growth stages and that roots had a much higher frequency of TSS than leaves, which indicated that developmental and metabolic traits may influence the expression states of duplicated genes in newly formed plant polyploids."
