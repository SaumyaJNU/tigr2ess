Studies of gene expression in synthetic polyploids have shown immediate expression and functional partitioning of duplicated genes among different tissues.

We assayed the tissue-specific silencing (TSS) of the parental homeologs of 30 key genes in the hybrids and tetraploids relative to the in vitro &#x0201c;hybrids&#x0201d; (parental mixes) using Sequenom MassARRAY.

Polyploidization occurred before the divergence of seed plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The common occurrence of WGD suggests an evolutionary advantage to plants having multiple genomes, resulting in polyploids having a greater adaptability than their diploid progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Polyploidy may have largely contributed to plant diversity because it provides the evolution of novel phenotypes with raw materials through the selection, retention and functional alteration of duplicate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Duplicated genes caused by WGD may experience three fates: nonfunctionalization, neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In newly formed polyploids, the division and alteration of ancestral patterns of duplicated genes are termed subfunctionalization (the two duplicates might divide the original function) and neofunctionalization (producing novel functions), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nonfunctionalization is considered the complete silencing or loss in all cell types and development stages, or null mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Following WGD, both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization may be significant ways to retain both copies, which is a precursor of future evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although a much effort has gone into understanding the tissue-specific expression of duplicated genes in some plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], only a few studies have focused on newly formed polyploids, such as cotton tetraploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and <italic>Tragopogon miscellus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The tissue-specific expression pattern may be dependent on the particular genotypes and genes, the cellular context and environmental conditions. Therefore, the functional significance needs to be investigated in each case. To our knowledge, many studies of the tissue-specific expression have focused on allopolyploids that have very different parental genomes, such as cotton and <italic>T. miscellus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], while limited studies have focused on autopolyploids or allopolyploids that have similar parental genomes. Although synthetic tetraploid rice shows extensive gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and phenotypic alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the tissue- and development-specific expression of homeologs were not investigated.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we used a model system involving the two Asian rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) subspecies, japonica and indica, which were both domesticated from a common wild progenitor, <italic>Oryza rufipogon</italic>, approximately 9,000&#x000a0;years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The two subspecies were domesticated to generate extensive genetic divergences and to obtain distinct growth, developmental and agronomic traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this study, a japonica rice (cv. Nipponbare) and an indica rice (cv. 9311), their reciprocal F1 hybrids and synthetic tetraploids were employed as a study system. This is an excellent system to assay the evolution of new genes and the relationship between genomic shock and phenotype alteration in young polyploids because high-quality genome sequences for each subspecies can be accessed. In the present study, we randomly selected 30 genes of eight key pathways to gain insights into the expression partitioning of homeologs among tissues and during development. We observed rapid and pervasive tissue-specific silencing (TSS) of homeologs in newly formed rice tetraploids but not in F1 hybrids, indicating an instantaneous creative role for WGD in the genome alteration. Interestingly, our results were not consistent with previous studies in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and <italic>T. miscellus</italic>, in which newly formed allopolyploids had a low TSS frequency similar to that of the F1 hybrid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in which the partitioning of homeologs among the tissues rarely came from instantaneous effects of GWD but primarily came from the long-term effects of evolution and domestication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par6">Construction of plant materials were described in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Reciprocal F1 hybrids N9 and 9&#x000a0;N were produced by crossing the two fully sequenced rice cultivars, Nipponbare and 9311. These two cultivars represent the two rice subspecies of Asian rice, japonica and indica, respectively. The tillers of the F1 hybrid plants were treated with colchicine to induce WGD. The synthetic rice allotetraploids were then self-pollinated for two generations under field conditions. All doubled plants with a confirmed euploid chromosome number were used for tissue collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All seeds used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. Bao Liu from Northeast Normal University (Changchun, China).We labeled cv.

The maternal parents of 99NN/9&#x000a0;N and NN99/N9 are cv. 9311 and cv. Nipponbare, respectively.

At the tillering stage, mature leaf and root tissues were collected and labeled as &#x0201c;L1&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;R1&#x0201d;. To minimize the mechanical damage from sampling to plant growth, we only collected a small plant sample for each rice line. The sampling is unlikely to have affected the expression partitioning of duplicate genes at the booting stage because the booting stage biomass is several times that of the tillering stage. After sampling at the tillering stage, the plants were continuously grown in the artificial climate room. At the booting stage, these plants were sampled again, and the mature leaf, root, flag leaf and young spike of the plants were collected and labeled as &#x0201c;L2&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;R2&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;F&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;S&#x0201d;, respectively. DNA was extracted with a modified CTAB protocol. The total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptTM RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).We estimated the qualities of RNA samples using RNA gel, and quantified the RNA concentrations with a NanoDrop machine (Thermo Scientific, USA). Then RNA samples of cv. 9311 and cv. Nipponbare were mixed in an equal RNA concentration. The cDNAs were synthesized from the equal RNA mixes of cv. 9311 and cv. Nipponbare to construct in vitro &#x0201c;hybrids&#x0201d; (labeled as MIX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

The Sequenom MassARRAY assays were conducted according to the method of Buggs et al., 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MassARRAY primers and probes for genome-specific expression were designed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. cDNA solution of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L (10&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L<sup>&#x02212;&#x02009;1</sup>) for each sample was used to perform PCR amplification and single-base primer extension reactions according to manufacturer&#x02019;s specifications (Sequenom). All expression data recovered from the MassARRAY were first filtered on the basis of internal measures of assay quality. The MassARRAY primers and probe were continuously filtered on the basis of assays of cv. Nipponbare and cv. 9311 DNA samples were mixed in known ratios (1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) and used to test the genome-specificity of each gene primers and probe. All genes were required to display a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.9) between the expected and observed N:9 DNA ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The 30 genes all play key roles in their corresponding pathways. To accurately calculate the frequency of TSS during development, we carried out a specific sampling method: the same individual was sampled twice at both tillering and at booting stages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This special sampling method can minimize &#x0201c;the effects of individual to individual&#x0201d; caused by variation in the genomic background during the assessment of the TSS of homeologs during development.

Several studies have made a connection between homeologous partitioning and phenotypic innovation. In Flaveria plants, the functional partitioning following the duplication of two key C4 photosynthetic genes, carbonic anhydrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], immediately led to a shift in the photosynthetic pathway from C3 to C4. In tomato, the duplication of the <italic>QD12</italic> gene created a new copy (<italic>SUN</italic> gene) through a copia-like retrotransposon. The new <italic>SUN</italic> copy was highly expressed in tomato fruit and was important for the elongated fruit shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, homeologous partitioning following the duplication of a single gene can generate phenotypic innovation. In many newly formed polyploids, WGD can induce massive amounts of expression and functional alterations of homeologs, which may rapidly promote the formation of new species or new traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]<sup>.</sup> In this study, we randomly chose 30 genes of eight key pathways to investigate the expression partitioning of homeologs among tissues and during the development.</p><p id="Par12">Firstly, we surveyed the effects of hybridization events (first step of polyploidization) on the expression of alleles by comparing MIX and F1. MIX had a higher percentage of TSS than F1 (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In MIX, 74% of locus (gene&#x000d7;individual) showed unequal expression pattern of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast, F1 plants have lower percentages of silencing event and TSS than MIX (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S4, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S5, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S7, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S8), and 60% of the locus of the F1 plants displayed equal expression pattern of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele, revealing that hybridization had caused an immediate and saltational disruption of parental expression patterns, and the original gene expression regulation was widely relaxed. In fact, in MIX, unequal expression pattern of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele represented gene expression difference between cv. 9311(&#x02018;9&#x02019;) and cv. Nipponbare (&#x02018;N&#x02019;). In natural condition (MIX), for some genes, differences between cv. 9311(&#x02018;9&#x02019;) and cv. Nipponbare (&#x02018;N&#x02019;) in allele expression may be attributable to their different <italic>Trans</italic> regulators; however, following genomic merger (hybridization), the <italic>Trans</italic> regulators of the local subgenome may mediate the expression of the allele of another foreign subgenome. In F1 rice plants, for some genes, given that promoter sequences of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele have a relatively few SNP or not SNP, their <italic>Trans</italic> regulators may have equal frequency to bind their CIS sequences and will result in such equal expression of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele. Homeolog partitioning of FtsH protease gene (HK-5) may be a typical support for this hypothesis. &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele of this gene was completely silenced in both root tissues (R1 and R2) of all MIX plants, but the expression of the &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele was re-activated in R1 and R2 of all F1 plants and all NN99 plants (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). Expression of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele of HK-5 gene in the F1 hybrids and NN99 plants may be activated by the <italic>Trans</italic> regulators of &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele of HK-5 gene. Interestingly, in R1 and R2 of some 99NN plants, the expression of the &#x02018;9&#x02019; copy was silenced again and was restored to its original expression pattern of MIX (Additional file 3: Figure S2). The re-silencing may be mediated by many complex mechanisms such as small interfering RNA, DNA methylation, transposon, and retrotransposon, which should be investigated in the future.</p><p id="Par13">Next, we examined the effect of WGD events on the expression of duplicate genes by comparing F1 and tetraploids (99NN and NN99). We found that both NN99 and 99NN had higher frequencies of TSS and biased expression than those of F1, with 99NN&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;NN99 (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). This indicated that, in rice tetraploids, WGD instantaneously affected the genetic consequences of hybridization events and induced the rapid and pervasive alteration of tissue-specific expression (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For instance, in all tissues of all F1 plants, response regulator receiver domain-containing protein (CP-2) gene showed equal expression of &#x02018;9&#x02019; allele and &#x02018;N&#x02019; allele, whereas &#x02018;N&#x02019; homeolog of this gene was silenced in most tissues of all NN99 plants and two 99NN plants (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). This donated that WGD may instantaneously shock the genetic consequences of hybridization in CP-2 gene, which potentially influenced the phenotypes of the newly formed rice tetraploids because CP-2 gene is a key gene for circadian and photomorphogenesis. Our results contradict those of the studies in cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and <italic>T. miscellus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], in which newly formed allopolyploids had low TSS frequencies similar to those of the respective F1 hybrids. We propose that, in these two species, the impact of WGD on homeologous TSS needs a longer time to manifest. This difference may be rooted in their distinct heterozygosities. The subgenomes of cotton and <italic>T. miscellus</italic> synthetic allopolyploids come from different species, and the subgenomes in rice tetraploids, being subspecies, are more closely related.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Development is instrumental in expression partitioning of homeologs</title><p id="Par14">In newly formed rice tetraploids, the most common fates for duplicate genes are that one of the copies retains the ancestral level of function and expression, and the second copy is lost (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In 99NN and NN99, 14 cases of reciprocal TSS (subfunctionalization) were found. Both copies of duplicate genes with subfunctionalization (reciprocal TSS) may be permanently preserved in subsequent long-term evolution. In yeast, after a WGD event, both copies of duplicated genes are permanently preserved either by neofunctionalization or classical subfunctionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This hypothesis was also supported by work on the synthetic cotton tetraploid, in which four genes showed similar silencing and/or expressional biases between synthetic and natural tetraploids, suggesting an evolutionary perseverance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In an important review on the evolution of duplicated genes, it has been pointed out that the retention of duplicated genes after WGD events affects the evolution of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some key questions were still unanswered, including: which duplicated genes are retained? and which factors influence the behavior of duplicated genes? Our results might be helpful in answering these questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We wondered whether development is instrumental in the expression partitioning of homeologs and whether different organs differ in the homeologous partitioning styles during development.</p><p id="Par15">Our results displayed that the developmental processes only produced a small effect on the homeologous expression partitioning of the F1 plants, whereas they strongly influenced the homeologous partitioning of NN99 and 99NN (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). For instance, in CP_1 gene of 99NN plant 8_4 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3), CR_1 gene of 99NN plant 8_5 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3), Chl_6 gene of NN99 plant 7_9 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S7) and HK_5 gene of NN99 plant 7_9 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2), the developmental processes led to homeologous expression partitioning in these rice tetraploid plants but not in the F1 plants. The homeologous expression partitioning may be mediated by different mechanisms, such as micro-RNA, DNA methylation, transposon insertion and histone modification. It also is likely that the developmental processes led to homeologous function partitioning in these genes, which should be further investigated through CRISPR/Cas9 or other knockout transgenic and over-expression experiments. In addition, the TSS frequency caused by development was much higher in roots than in leaves (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). When crossing the tillering and booting stages, leaf tissue had much smaller metabolic changes than root tissue. At the booting stage, the vegetative growth rate of rice is lowered and reproductive development begins. The root activity starts to decline and root tissues may experience large metabolic shifts. This developmental process may affect the expression of homeologs. Thus, we propose that both developmental and metabolic traits influence the expression states of duplicate genes in newly formed polyploids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par16">The F1 plants showed lower percentages of homeologous TSS than MIX, revealing that hybridization had caused an immediate and saltational disruption of parental expression patterns, and the original gene expression regulation was widely relaxed.

Additionally, the TSS frequency in the rice tetraploids varied at different growth stages and the roots had a much higher frequency of TSS than the leaves.
