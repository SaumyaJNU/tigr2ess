Here, coal seams present something of an oasis for microbial life, providing moisture, warmth, and abundant fossilized organic material. Microbes in coal seams are thought to syntrophically mobilize fossilized carbon from the geosphere to the biosphere. Despite the environmental and economic importance of this process, little is known about the microbial ecology of coal seams. In the current study, ecological succession and spatial niche partitioning are explored in three coal seam microbial communities. Scanning electron microscopic visualization and 16S rRNA sequencing track changes in microbial communities over time, revealing distinct attached and planktonic communities displaying patterns of ecological succession. Attachment to the coal surface is biofilm mediated on Surat coal, whereas microbes on Sydney and Gunnedah coal show different attachment processes. This study demonstrates that coal seam microbial&#x000a0;communities undergo spatial niche partitioning during periods of succession as microbes colonize coal environments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Coal surfaces and waters have distinctly different microbial communities</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Microbes attach to coal surfaces via multiple adhesion strategies</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Adhesion strategies include biofilm formation and direct cell attachment</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Coal microbe succession patterns provide insights into possible community roles</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Coal Geochemistry; Biogeoscience; Microbiology; Microbiome</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Subject Areas</title><kwd>Coal Geochemistry</kwd><kwd>Biogeoscience</kwd><kwd>Microbiology</kwd><kwd>Microbiome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: February 22, 2019</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Despite global efforts to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, coal remains a key fuel for energy generation. Microbially produced coal seam gas (CSG) has been suggested as a way to aid transition from traditional fossil fuels to renewables. Improving our understanding of microbial communities responsible for the production of CSG, particularly with respect to how these communities function and the roles played by the individual taxa in this process, is critical for understanding this important geochemical process, as well as for developing methods for stimulating CSG production (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rice and Claypool, 1981</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Coal seam microbial communities exist in the deep subsurface within water-filled cleats of coal seams. They have often been spatially isolated and adapted to survive on recalcitrant carbon sources under chemically reduced conditions with limited terminal electron acceptors (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Str&#x00105;po&#x00107; et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Studies of microbial communities inhabiting these environments have largely focused on surveying communities associated with coal seam formation waters (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). These studies have mostly aimed to increase methane production rates <italic>in situ</italic>. These studies typically use either biostimulation, introducing nutrients (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colosimo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), or bioaugmentation, introducing exogenous microbes, to enhance gas yield (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fuertez et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">An important gap in our understanding of coal seam microbiology is the metabolic and ecological roles&#x000a0;played by the majority of the bacterial taxa observed in coal seams. The archaea largely have well-defined roles in hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic, and methylotrophic methanogenesis owing to their&#x000a0;taxonomically constrained metabolisms, whereas the metabolic roles played by the majority of bacterial taxa remain poorly understood (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colosimo et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). One way to investigate the metabolic contributions of specific microbes is through examining their patterns of succession when the microbial community is introduced to an environment. This approach has been used in fields of macroecology, where functional roles or niches are often inferred from an organism's traits. For example, the competitive, stress-tolerant, and ruderal (CSR) classification is used in plant ecology to explain how&#x000a0;plant traits will influence their patterns of succession (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Grime, 2006</xref>). In microbial ecology, an organism's traits are often difficult to elucidate if axenic cultures are not readily obtainable. In this case the succession patterns of organisms can be used to hypothesize on the traits possessed by the organisms.</p><p id="p0045">One example of a system in which the succession patterns of individual microorganisms has been used to infer functional traits of microorganisms is leaf colonization and decomposition. This system provides a well-studied, analogous system to coal seams. In these systems when a limited heterogeneous resource (the fallen leaf) is introduced, a succession of fungal and bacterial species are observed, rising and falling in abundance as they compete, sequentially utilize, and exhaust the resource, starting with the most labile components and proceeding through increasingly recalcitrant ones (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Frankland, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Remacle, 1971</xref>). An examination of succession in coal seams, a similar endogenously heterotrophic environment, where the abundances of individual taxa are tracked over time may similarly provide insights into the ecological roles of individual bacterial taxa (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fierer et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Another ecological concept that warrants particular attention in the coal seam context is spatial niche partitioning. Microbes in coal seams are known to exist in water-filled cleats, and studies have shown that different microbial communities are observed on solid coal samples compared with associated formation waters (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Klein et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lawson et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barnhart et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). The observation of a biofilm formed by a coal seam microbial community on a coal surface suggests that spatial partitioning between the coal surface and associated waters is an important split in coal seam microbial communities (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vick et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Cell attachment and spatial partitioning may be driven by a requirement to access insoluble carbon sources in the coal. Spatial partitions may thus mirror a functional split wherein primary fermenters of the coal organic matter attach to the substrate to access insoluble compounds (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Furmann et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). This phenomenon has been documented on aerobically incubated oil sand's bitumen (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wyndham and Costerton, 1981</xref>) and in the animal gut where anaerobic primary degraders attach to plant biomass, increasing the degradation rates of insoluble compounds such as cellulose (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Costerton, 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Minato et&#x000a0;al., 1966</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">The current study examines succession and spatial partitioning to address previously unexplored questions about microbial ecology in coal seam environments. These include the following questions: What are the successional patterns of coal seam microbial taxa and can they be used to assign functional roles? How does studying the planktonic and attached communities separately inform us about the roles and niches of microbial taxa in coal seams? How universal are these patterns between different coal seam environments? Addressing these questions may provide important insights into the microbes inhabiting deep subsurface environments where microbial communities utilize complex fossilized resources for energy and biomass.</p><p id="p0060">The patterns of succession in microbial communities growing on coal from three different coal basins, under physicochemical conditions mimicking each coal seam environment, are explored in the current study. Coal-degrading microcosms were used to study this succession with inoculation of crushed coal supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus sources mimicking the introduction of meteoric water into a newly exposed coal seam or the liberation of nitrogen- or phosphorus-rich compounds from an exposed mineral source in the coal seam. Community profiles for the attached and planktonic communities were tracked over time from inoculation through to a more mature state with methane production, as a terminal metabolite, measured at each time point. Physical interactions of the attached communities and the coal surface were examined by scanning electron microscopy to investigate modes of attachment and biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Coal Seam Microbial Communities Differ in Structure between Attached and Planktonic Samples for All Coal Types</title><p id="p0065">16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing performed on the attached and planktonic cells of the 189 microcosms, as well as inoculum, resulted in 379 community profiles after two samples failed PCR amplification.

Within the terrestrial subsurface, coal seams present an interesting environment where fossilized carbon, containing organic molecules not typically encountered by most organisms, is degraded to methane. The current study, looking at three different microbial communities on their native coals, represents a comprehensive examination of the distinct differences in attached and planktonic communities living on coal and the successional patterns of these communities over time. This study also reports on the observation of community-specific attachment strategies, including biofilm formation and direct cell attachment to coal.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Attached and Planktonic Communities Are Distinct in Coal Seams</title><p id="p0160">Previous studies of coal seams have shown that microbial communities associated with coal solids often differ from those in associated waters. Although these studies show differences in microbial communities associated with mine waters and coal blocks (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), coal cuttings and production waters (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lawson et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Klein et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), and coal solids and culture media (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), it is not always clear how much of this variation arises from true spatial partitioning. To explicitly examine spatial partitioning, three different coal seam communities were examined on their native coals and formation waters over a &#x0223c;110-day incubation to determine how universal attachment was in different coal environments and whether it is a phenomenon seen in both colonizing and mature stages. Significantly different attached and planktonic communities were observed at both the OTU and phylum levels for all three coal communities and at all time points of incubation. Differences in these attached and planktonic communities at the phylum level included distinct differences in the relative abundances of the Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Some of the differences in the attached and planktonic communities were universal to all three coals, such as the association of Firmicutes and euryarchaeotal species with the planktonic communities and the proteobacterial species with the attached communities, a finding supported by other studies (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barnhart et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Other differences were coal type (e.g., Actinobacteria, Cloacimonetes) or temporally (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes) influenced.</p><p id="p0165">The statistically significant differences observed between the planktonic and attached communities in all three coal seam microcosms at all time points suggest that this spatial separation is important in these coal seam communities. This spatial separation mirrors a major functional division observed in communities from other anaerobic microbial environments, including the rumen and animal gut where attached microbes are commonly involved in the initial degradation of cellulose and other insoluble substrates (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Minato et&#x000a0;al., 1966</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Costerton, 1992</xref>). As the organic matter in coal is primarily composed of insoluble components, the study of the attached and planktonic communities as discreet entities should be considered in future studies and may provide insights into the organisms responsible for the initial degradation of coal compounds, the identification of which remains a fundamental question in coal seam microbial ecology (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Patterns of Succession Observed in Coal Seam Microbial Communities</title><p id="p0170">Coal seam microbial communities have typically been studied at either a single time point or before and after the addition of a nutrient or additive (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). One notable exception is a study by Susilawati and colleagues (2015), which observed temporal changes in one Indonesian microbial community grown on three different coals over a period of 20&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Susilawati et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Jones and colleagues (2010) also tracked the abundances of a select few organisms within a microbial community growing on coal over a period of 102&#x000a0;days; however, these microbial communities were derived from a wetland sediment rather than a native coal community (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The current study has expanded upon this examination of temporal changes in coal seam microbial communities and examined three different Australian coal seam communities grown with their native coals and matched formation waters.</p><p id="p0175">Generally these changes, across all coal communities, include a decrease in the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria over time with a concomitant increase in the relative abundances of the Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes, a finding supported by observations in Indonesian coals (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Susilawati et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). This, along with the observation that proportions of Proteobacteria are higher in the attached communities, whereas the Euryarchaeota and Firmicutes appear in higher abundances planktonically, suggests that the Proteobacteria play a role in the breakdown of insoluble coal material for use by secondary fermenting Firmicutes taxa and methanogenic archaea.</p><p id="p0180">Examining the communities at the OTU level reveals temporally driven changes to individual members of the community, most obvious in Surat Basin microcosms. Replicate microcosms were initially quite divergent but became much more tightly clustered at the final time points according to principal-component analysis. This suggests that the community composition during early colonization processes is variable, perhaps due to stochastic factors associated with inoculation rates of rapidly growing taxa. Communities become increasingly similar as time goes on, suggesting that as the microbial communities modify their environment through decomposition of the coal substrate and production of downstream metabolites, a subset of specialized taxa, including the methanogens, which are not as influenced by initial inoculation and growth rates, take over. This effect appears to be characteristic of succession in diverse microbial communities and suggests that the Surat communities may be reaching a point of climax or stability (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dini-Andreote et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kielak et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). However, it should be noted that these coal seam microcosms represent endogenous heterotrophic environments and as such this stability may change if the current pools of compounds supplying carbon&#x000a0;and energy are depleted and metabolism turns to a different pool of resources (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fierer et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">At the individual OTU level there were a number of successional patterns observed for the various taxa in the coal seams. Some, such as OTU_8, a <italic>Citrobacter</italic> sp., and OTU_5, an <italic>Acetobacterium</italic> sp., spiked in abundance at very early time points before quickly declining, particularly in the planktonic communities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). This observation was also identified in the LEfSe analysis where these OTUs are involved in driving the changes between the day 3 and day 7 communities for the Sydney and Gunnedah communities, respectively (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). These taxa may be analogous to ruderal species in plant communities, which are able to utilize a readily available niche and grow rapidly, but are then replaced by competitors or stress-tolerant species with somewhat slower growth rates. Ruderal life strategies have previously been associated with genomic features such as 16S rRNA gene copy number of diverse bacterial species, which may help explain these observed succession patterns in the coal seam (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Klappenbach et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Conversely, several taxa, such as OTU_31, a <italic>Coriobacteriaceae</italic> sp. and OTU_7, a <italic>Thermoanaerobacteraceae</italic> sp., gradually increase in abundance over time in the planktonic community of the Sydney microcosms and attached community of the Gunnedah microcosms, respectively, only reaching high abundances at later time points. These taxa are likely more specialized in their metabolisms and are probably utilizing compounds slowly liberated from the coal. Another interesting successional pattern observed for OTU_3 (<italic>Methanocalculus</italic> sp.) in the planktonic community of the Sydney microcosms and OTU_13 (Firmicutes) in the planktonic community of the Surat microcosms was a rapid increase in abundance until an intermediate time point followed by an abrupt drop and continued low abundance. These taxa could be presumed to be utilizing a limited resource in the coal or formation water, or a downstream metabolite of it based upon the observation of these trends in the planktonic and not attached communities, which becomes depleted or for which they are outcompeted. Future examinations of succession in coal seam communities may benefit from tracking organic intermediates in the culture media to correlate changes in metabolite concentrations with organism abundances with the aim of elucidating the metabolisms of these particular taxa (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Orem et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, for all these taxa showing distinct successional patterns, in none of the observed instances were the successional patterns the same across the multiple coal types examined despite the OTUs presence in all three communities. It is speculated that these coals may either have very distinctly different biodegradable components or that the communities have a high degree of functional redundancy, allowing for different taxa to fill metabolic niches depending on their competitive advantage at the various physicochemical parameters present in the coal environments. This hypothesis, however, would have to be tested in further studies and would require a greater understanding of the functional clades that bacteria form in coal seam environments. One question of interest would be whether coal seam communities converge in terms of the functional clades present and their relative abundances in the attached and planktonic coal seam communities as succession on a coal resource progresses.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Attached Communities from Different Coal Seams Differ in Their Attachment Strategies</title><p id="p0190">Previously coal attachment via biofilms (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Raudsepp et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hazrin-Chong and Manefield, 2012</xref>) and direct cell interactions (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hazrin-Chong et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bagdigian and Myerson, 1986</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Skidmore, 1988</xref>) has been observed for microbes grown on coal aerobically, whereas little examination of this phenomena has been made for native anaerobic microbial consortia (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vick et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Here, distinct attached communities of microbes were seen in all three coal communities, whereas scanning electron microscopic visualization of the coal surface identified biofilm formation in only Surat Basin microcosms. This suggests an alternative attachment strategy in the other communities, similar to that observed for <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> on coal (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hazrin-Chong et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), which may involve adhesin, other protein-mediated attachment, or more general hydrophobic-cell-to-substrate interactions (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Marshall and Cruickshank, 1973</xref>). Surat Basin microcosms showed the development of a biofilm that recruited successive morphotypes and increased in density over time. Surat coal was initially colonized by a rod-shaped, micro-colony-forming morphotype. This morphotype may be represented by OTU_8, a <italic>Citrobacter</italic> sp. based on the predominance of this OTU at early time points in attached Surat communities and morphological features of <italic>Citrobacter</italic> sp. isolated from related formation waters (unpublished data). Another morphotype that appeared in abundance at an early time point on Surat coals was a vibrioid cell with multiple polar flagella, which may be represented by OTU_26, a <italic>Geovibrio</italic> sp.<italic>,</italic> or OTU_15, a <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> sp., both of which appeared to show similar abundances to the morphotype in Surat attached communities.</p><p id="p0195">Surat Basin biofilms appeared to nucleate in patches starting with a cocci morphotype, and once a certain density was reached a number of rod-shaped morphotypes colonized the upper layer of the biofilm. This appears similar to observations made by <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Costerton (1992)</xref> who noted that in rumen particles a primary degrader of an insoluble substrate would form a biofilm plaque to concentrate enzymes or other compounds for substrate solubilization and degradation. This would be followed by attachment of a secondary fermenter to the upper layers of the biofilm removing inhibitory metabolic by-products, resulting in an increased substrate degradation rate (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Costerton, 1992</xref>). This suggests that the coccoid morphotype may be of particular interest to studies of primary fermenters as it appeared to be the first to form attachment to the coal through a biofilm-mediated process after which different morphotypes, presumably representing secondary fermenters, were recruited to the biofilm.</p><p id="p0200">Interestingly, previous work has shown that a microbial community from the Sydney coal basin is capable of appreciable biofilm formation when grown on a Bowen Basin coal (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vick et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), indicating that coal seam communities hold the potential to form biofilm attachments but fail to do so when presented with unsuitable coals. This hypothesis is supported by observations of significantly higher methane production in Surat microcosms, suggesting that this coal is more amenable to microbial degradation. It remains to be shown, however, what physicochemical factors of this coal make it more amenable to biodegradation as&#x000a0;the Surat microcosms differ to the other microcosms in multiple physicochemical parameters including decreased salinity of the formation water and higher volatile organic matter in the coal. It was observed, from LEfSe analysis, that more OTUs drove differences between the attached and planktonic communities in the Surat microcosms than the Sydney and Gunnedah microcosms; it may be some of these OTUs, observed as driving attachment in the Surat but not the other microcosms, which selectively form biofilms when presented with a suitable coal. Exploration of the apparent directed nucleation of biofilms at certain regions and types of coal could provide important insights into understanding the components of coal targeted by microbes for biodegradation.

Combining these chemical characterizations with classical&#x000a0;petrological and molecular ecological techniques may provide insights into whether particular maceral groups or layers of bedding represent hotspots for microbial attachment and catabolism.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0205">The current study demonstrates the presence of two distinct spatially separated microbial communities, attached to the coal or living planktonically, across three different coal environments. Although attachment of microbes to the coal surface was common to all the coals, the mode of attachment was variable with Sydney and Gunnedah Basin communities showing direct cell attachment and the Surat Basin community developing a biofilm. The current study also shows that distinct patterns of succession are observed for these attached and planktonic communities during a period of over a hundred days. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of spatial and temporal partitioning in driving microbial community structures in coal seam environments and suggest that future studies of coal should involve the design of experiments with spatial and temporal variations in mind. Future work examining the functional characteristics of microbes associated with attachment phenotypes at certain time points in succession also has the potential to address fundamental questions about the primary fermenting bacteria in the coal seam, a key area of investigation in coal seam microbial ecology (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ritter et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="p0210">Coal seam microbial communities in eastern Australia have been shown to differ in some aspects from other seams in North America, particularly in the dominant classes of methanogens observed (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Vick et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).
