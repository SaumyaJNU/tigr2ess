    "Spine colour is an important fruit quality trait that influences the commercial value of cucumber (Cucumis sativus). However, little is known about the metabolites and the regulatory mechanisms of their biosynthesis in black spine varieties. In this study, we determined that the pigments of black spines are flavonoids, including flavonols and proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified CsMYB60 as the best candidate for the previously identified B (Black spine) locus. Expression levels of CsMYB60 and the key genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were higher in black-spine inbred lines than that in white-spine lines at different developmental stages. The insertion of a Mutator-like element (CsMULE) in the second intron of CsMYB60 decreased its expression in a white-spine line. Transient overexpression assays indicated that CsMYB60 is a key regulatory gene and Cs4CL is a key structural gene in the pigmentation of black spines. In addition, the DNA methylation level in the CsMYB60 promoter was much lower in the black-spine line compared with white-spine line. The CsMULE insert may decrease the expression level of CsMYB60, causing hindered synthesis of flavonols and PAs in cucumber fruit spines."
