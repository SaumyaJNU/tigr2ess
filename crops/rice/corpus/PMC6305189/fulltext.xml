The visual appearance of the fruit is a highly important commercial trait (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), and the colour of the fruit spines (specialized trichomes) is one of the characteristics that determines the economic value (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Genetic analysis has indicated that the black fruit-spine trait is controlled by a single gene, <italic>B</italic> (<italic>Black</italic> or <italic>brown spine 1</italic>) and it is dominant over the white trait (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Walters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> mapped the <italic>B</italic> gene to a 50-kb region of the short arm of cucumber chromosome 4 (chr.4) based on linkage analysis using 2001 F<sub>2</sub> plants from a cross between two inbred lines, WI7200 (black-spine, orange mature fruit) and WI7201 (white-spine, cream-coloured mature fruit). In this 50-kb region, a gene encoding a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, later named <italic>CsMYB60</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), was considered as the best candidate for <italic>B</italic>, because of the presence of a 1-bp deletion in the third intron and a lower expression level of this R2R3-MYB gene in both immature and mature fruit in WI7201 compared with WI7200 (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, more data are needed to confirm that <italic>CsMYB60</italic> is the <italic>B</italic> locus. In addition, the composition of pigments and the mechanisms regulating their biosynthesis in black-spine plants also need to be clarified.</p><p>Flavonoids constitute a large family of plant secondary metabolites that are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway, and they can be categorized into chalcones, flavonols, flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, and proanthocyanidins. They are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and are beneficial as physiologically active compounds, stress-protecting agents, attractants, and feeding deterrents, as well as playing a general and significant role in plant resistance to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental stress (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Treutter, 2006</xref>). Moreover, many flavonoids are active principles of medicinal plants and exhibit pharmacological effects (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Marles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Yilmaz and Toledo, 2004</xref>). Flavonols are present in fruit and vegetables, and they are consumed in considerable amounts in the human diet (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Leo and Woodman, 2015</xref>). Flavonols have blood pressure-lowering activity (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dauchet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The blood pressure-lowering effects of quercetin were first reported in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Perez-Vizcaino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and subsequently in other animal models of hypertension (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dauchet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition to such activity, flavonols modulate tissue antioxidant status by direct scavenging of free radicals (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In some studies, Kaempferol has been shown to improve the survival and function of &#x003b2;-cells and human islets cultured in the presence of high glucose, leading to enhanced insulin secretion (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Quercetin protects &#x003b2;-cell function and viability, and reduces oxidative damage induced by inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Dai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Thus, flavonols may be used as novel anti-diabetic agents (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Leo and Woodman, 2015</xref>). Proanthocyanidins (PAs; also called condensed tannins) are polymeric end-products of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, and their monomeric building blocks, catechin and epicatechin, have cardioprotective (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Serafini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), anti-cancer (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and anti-inflammatory benefits as antioxidants. Moderate levels of PAs in forage crops also improve nitrogen nutrition, reduce urinary nitrogen excretion, and help counter intestinal parasites in the animals that consume them (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Aerts <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>MYB proteins belong to a large family of transcription factors. Certain MYB proteins are key regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). MtPAR is a MYB family transcription factor that positively regulates PA biosynthesis in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Verdier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Three R2R3-MYB proteins (MYB11, MYB12, and MYB111) activate the early flavonoid biosynthetic genes to regulate flavonol biosynthesis, whilst the later flavonoid biosynthetic genes are activated by the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex to control the production of anthocyanins and PAs (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2014</xref>). As a key enzyme, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) provides the precursors for flavonoid and lignin biosynthesis (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Studies in the fields of genomics and epigenetics have recently demonstrated the importance of transposable elements in genome function and evolution (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hirsch and Springer, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Song and Cao, 2017</xref>). As transposable elements propagate in plant genomes and attract epigenetic marks, their neo-insertions can lead to the formation of new, heritable epigenetic variants of genes in their vicinity and impact on the host gene regulatory networks (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Bucher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). For example, a transposon-induced epigenetic change leads to sex determination in melon (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In this case, the transition from male to female flowers in gynoecious lines results from epigenetic changes in the promoter of a transcription factor, CmWIP1, an inhibitor of female flower development. This natural and heritable epigenetic change results from the insertion of a transposon, which is required for the initiation and maintenance of spreading of DNA methylation to the <italic>CmWIP1</italic> promoter.</p><p>The transposon <italic>Mutator</italic> was first identified in maize and was later found in other plants, bacteria, fungi, and protozoans (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Robertson, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The typical structure of a <italic>Mutator</italic>-like transposable element (MULE) includes terminated inverted repeats (TIRs; usually 100&#x02013;500 bp) flanking an internal sequence and one target site duplication (TSD; usually 8&#x02013;11 bp) flanking each TIR (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Wicker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). MULEs are especially prevalent in higher plant genomes. For example, the Arabidopsis genome contains at least 200 MULEs (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">van Leeuwen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and the <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> genome contains more than 10000 copies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). MULEs contribute to the evolution of gene innovation and novelty in plant genomes by capturing ectopic genomic sequences and changing DNA methylation (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Because MULEs are one of the most active mobile elements in plants, they have been widely employed as a mutagenizing system (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Meeley and Briggs, 1995</xref>). To date, little is known regarding the functions of MULEs in the evolution of gene innovation and novelty in the genome of cucumber.</p><p>In this study, by combining transcriptomic and metabolic profiles, we determined that the pigments of the black fruit spines in cucumber are composed of flavonoids, primarily flavonols and PAs. We revealed the key roles of <italic>CsMYB60</italic>, the best candidate for the <italic>B</italic> gene, and <italic>Cs4CL</italic> in the colouration of black spines, and we found that the decrease in expression of <italic>CsMYB60</italic> in white-spine plants is caused by an insertion of a <italic>Mutator</italic>-like element, which might function in an epigenetic manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Twenty-two inbred lines of cucumber (<italic>Cucumis sativus</italic> L.; 2<italic>n</italic>=2<italic>x</italic>=14) were used. Plants were grown for two generations each year in a solar greenhouse at the experimental field at Shandong Agricultural University. Standard commercial management was performed during the cultivation period. All spines on fruit from between nodes 8 and 18 of cucumber plants were sampled using a scalpel, and immediately put into liquid nitrogen. The lines RNS8 (white spines) and RNS9 (black spines) were selected for detailed analysis. Unless otherwise stated, the following methods and the results refer to these two lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Imaging of fruit spines</title><p>Fruit spines of the lines RNS8 and RNS9 were examined under a dissection microscope (Leica M165 FC) from 2 d before anthesis (DBA) to 12 d after anthesis (DAA), when the fruit were ~35&#x02013;40 mm long and ~300&#x02013;350 mm long, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>NMR experimental procedures</title><p>To obtain purified samples for NMR, column chromatography was carried out using a Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare), and HPLC chromatography was performed on an Alltech instrument (426-HPLC pump, Alltech UV-vis-200 detector) equipped with Kromasil semi-preparative (10 &#x003bc;m, ODS, 10 &#x000d7; 250 mm) and YMC-Pack C8 (5 &#x003bc;m, 10 &#x000d7; 250 mm) columns. The purified samples were subjected to NMR analysis. <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on an AVANCE 400 FT 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Chemical shifts (&#x003b4;) are expressed in parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (J) are reported in Hz. Electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS was conducted using a Bruker APEX IV instrument. Black spines (2.15 g) from RNS9 fruit were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and then extracted with water. After evaporation of the water by rotavapor, the residue (300 mg) was partitioned by water. Samples were then subjected to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and eluted with MeOH:H<sub>2</sub>O (1:1) to obtain six fractions (F1&#x02013;F6). F1 mainly contained sugar (determined by TLC), while F2&#x02013;F4 contained flavonoid glycoside (detected by UV and 1H NMR). F5 and F6 were mainly low polarity components and only contained trace flavonoid glycosides. F2 was separated by semi-HPLC with CH<sub>3</sub>CN-H<sub>2</sub>O (7%) to obtain purified compound A (5.6 mg), F3 was separated by semi-HPLC with CH<sub>3</sub>CN-H<sub>2</sub>O (8%) to obtain compound B (5.6 mg) and compound C (4.3 mg), and F4 was separated by semi-HPLC with CH<sub>3</sub>CN-H<sub>2</sub>O (10%) to obtain compound D (1.8 mg) and compound E (1.4 mg).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>LC-MS analysis</title><p>In order to compare the metabolic profiles of black and white spines, a metabolomics approach was performed.

The spine colour is a fruit-related characteristic and is considered an important factor for the economic value of the fruit (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Cultivated cucumber was domesticated from its wild form <italic>Cucumis sativus var. hardwickii</italic>, which still grows in the Himalayan foothills in India, Myanmar, north and west Thailand, and southwest China (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Qi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Renner, 2017</xref>).

In this study, we determined that the pigments of black spines mainly comprise flavonols and PAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>). A previous study showed that epidermal flavonoids, which absorb UV-radiation, protect the internal tissues of leaves and stems (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Treutter, 2006</xref>). In addition, an inheritance study using groundnut provided good evidence for quercetin and rutin having a significant negative impact on the development and mortality of neonate larvae of <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> in interspecific derivatives of <italic>Arachis</italic> species (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Mallikarjuna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). PAs that are present in the fruit, bark, leaves, and seeds of many plants can provide protection against predation and disease (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Dixon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Moreover, both the traits of orange skin in mature fruit and black spines are controlled by a single dominant gene (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Thus, as a result of natural selection, the flavonoid pigments in black spines and fruit skin should provide protection for the seeds of wild cucumber. Flavonoids in various plants are beneficial not only for the plant itself as physiologically active compounds or as stress-protecting agents (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Treutter, 2006</xref>) but also for humans as antioxidants (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Qin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Therefore, our present findings might provide the impetus for a new direction of breeding to obtain increasing flavonoids in the fruit endocarp of cucumber to benefit human health.</p><p>Genetic analysis has indicated that the black fruit-spine trait is controlled by a single gene, <italic>B</italic>, and is dominant over the white trait (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Walters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). A R2R3-MYB gene on cucumber chr.4 has been considered the best candidate for the <italic>B</italic> locus (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), and this gene was named <italic>CsMYB60</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In our present study, through SNP association, we also mapped <italic>B</italic> to the same region of chr.4 containing <italic>CsMYB60</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>), and we found that all the tested inbred lines with white spines had an altered allele and reduced expression of <italic>CsMYB60</italic> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Finally, overexpression of <italic>CsMYB60</italic> could transform white spines into black spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). These findings indicate that <italic>CsMYB60</italic> can be identified as the <italic>B</italic> locus.</p><p>Control of the flavonoid pathway is an ancestral function of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex in plants (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<italic>a</italic></xref>). In Arabidopsis, the MBW complex activates late flavonoid biosynthetic genes to control the production of anthocyanins and PAs, whereas early flavonoid biosynthetic genes are activated by three R2R3-MYB proteins (MYB11, MYB12, and MYB111) (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2014</xref>). Flavonoid MBW proteins might be conserved in cucumber, but the mechanisms regulated by the MBW complex and/or by MYB proteins may differ from those in Arabidopsis and other plants (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015<italic>a</italic></xref>) because our data showed that <italic>Cs4CL</italic>, the last structural gene in general phenylpropanoid metabolism, is the limiting gene for flavonoid biosynthesis in cucumber and is activated indirectly by <italic>CsMYB60</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). To our knowledge, this kind of regulatory mechanism has not been reported before. Further studies are needed to clarify the detailed mechanisms responsible for flavonoid biosynthesis.</p><p>
<italic>Mutator</italic> transposons are the most ubiquitous DNA transposable elements in plant genomes and play a special role in gene and genome evolution (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Diao and Lisch, 2006</xref>). <italic>Mutator</italic> activity can result in a wide range of changes, including changes in gene expression (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Raizada <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In our study, the insertion in the second intron of <italic>CsMYB60</italic> in white-spined RNS8 was found to be a CsMULE based on its typical <italic>Mutator</italic> characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9C</xref>, D). The decreased expression level of <italic>CsMYB60</italic> might have been caused by this CsMULE in an epigenetic manner because the methylation level of a particular region of the <italic>CsMYB60</italic> promoter was much higher in the white-spine inbred line than in the black (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>). This result is in agreement with a previous study of the transition from male to female flowers in gynoecious melon, where the natural and heritable epigenetic change resulted from the insertion of a transposon that is required for the initiation and maintenance of the spreading of DNA methylation to the <italic>CmWIP1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Transposon-mediated epigenetic regulation in gene expression also occurs in rice (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Song and Cao, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The transposon <italic>Mutator</italic> has been recognized as being one of the most active mobile elements in plants and has been widely employed as a mutagenizing system (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">van Leeuwen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).
