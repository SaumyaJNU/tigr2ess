Although the MADS-box gene family genes have been extensively characterized in many plants, they have not been studied in closely related species. In this study, 73 and 74 MADS-box genes were identified in European pear (<italic>Pyrus communis</italic>) and Chinese pear (<italic>Pyrus bretschneideri</italic>), respectively. Based on the phylogenetic relationship, these genes could be clustered into five groups (M&#x003b1;, M&#x003b2;, Mr, MIKC<sup>C</sup>, MIKC*) and the MIKC<sup>C</sup> group was further categorized into 10 subfamilies. The distribution of MADS-box genes on each chromosome was significantly nonrandom. Thirty-seven orthologs, twenty-five <italic>PcpMADS</italic> (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>communis</italic> MADS-box) paralogs and nineteen <italic>PbrMADS</italic> (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>bretschneideri</italic> MADS-box) paralogs were predicted. Among these paralogous genes, two pairs arose from tandem duplications (TD), nineteen from segmental duplication (SD) events and twenty-three from whole genome duplication (WGD) events, indicating SD/WGD events led to the expansion of MADS-box gene family. The MADS-box genes expression profiles in pear fruits indicated functional divergence and neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization of some orthologous genes originated from a common ancestor. This study provided a useful reference for further analysis the mechanisms of species differentiation and biodiversity formation among closely related species.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 31,640,068) and The Postgraduate Innovation Fund of Anhui Agricultural University (grant 2018yjs-45).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">MADS-box transcription factors have been reported in animals, plants and fungi, which initiated transcription of target gene by binding to the CArG-boxes domain in the cis-acting element of the target gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. According to molecular evolutionary analysis, MADS-box genes have been classified into two large groups: type I (SRF) and type II (MEF2).

Remarkably, the MADS-box gene has a highly conserved MADS (M) domain with about 60 amino acid sequences in the N-terminal regions.

In the early 1990s, in order to explain the characteristics of plant floral organs, the researchers put forward the hypothesis of floral organ ABC model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Based on the analysis of ABC model, class A genes specifically regulate the occurrence and development of calyx, class A and B genes together control the formation of petals, class B and C genes jointly determine the occurrence of stamens, while class C genes regulate the development of carpels. Surprisingly, recent reverse genetics studies have exposed that class D and E genes also play a vital role in regulating flower morphogenesis. Among them, class D genes mainly regulate the development of ovules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and class E genes are mainly involved in regulating the formation and development of all floral organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Subsequently, the Pfam database and the SMART database were used to determine candidate MADS-box proteins containing the complete MADS domain. Ultimately, 73 and 74 members of the MADS-box gene family were identified in European pear and Chinese pear, respectively. The total number of MADS-box genes in the two <italic>Pyrus</italic> species was basically similar. According to the chromosomal location, these genes were named as <italic>PcpMADS01</italic> to <italic>PcpMADS73</italic> and <italic>PbrMADS01</italic> to <italic>PbrMADS74</italic>, respectively. In order to further understand the differences in the MADS-box gene family between the two <italic>Pyrus</italic> species, we compared the differences in exon-intron structure between European pear and Chinese pear.

To study the evolution of MADS-box gene family, a comparative genomic analysis of MADS-box genes in 24 plant species was carried out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. While most of these MADS-box gene families have been reported, the comparison of MADS-box genes in two <italic>Pyrus</italic> species was performed for the first time in this study.

The tree topologies produced by the two algorithms were largely consistent with only minor discrepancies. Therefore, only the ML phylogenetic tree was used to further analysis in our study, and the results were basically consistent with previously studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In these phylogenetic trees, each of the seven species contributed at least one MADS-box gene to most subfamilies, while the <italic>FLC</italic> and <italic>ANR1</italic> subfamilies lacked members of the European pear and Chinese pear MADS-box genes. These results indicated that the MADS-box gene exhibited a conservative evolutionary relationship in the Rosaceae genomes. Subsequently, for these 73 <italic>PcpMADS</italic> genes and 74 <italic>PbrMADS</italic> genes, 40 members and 40 members could been clearly divided into type II, however, the remaining 67 members were clustered into type I based on their relationship with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> MADS-box gene family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, type I was further divided into three subfamilies: M&#x003b1;, M&#x003b2;, M&#x003b3;, each of which had 18, 7 and 8 members in European pear, respectively, and contained 12, 5 and 17 members in Chinese pear, respectively.

In the present study, the conserved motif encoding the MADS domain was identified in each MADS-box gene of European pear and Chinese pear. Noteworthy, a total of 70 MADS-box proteins were identified as MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes in the European pear and Chinese pear genomes. However, we found that only 61 MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type MADS-box genes, containing the K domain and motif 1 (encoding the MADS domain), a similar motif distribution was shared by the same subfamily of PcpMADS and PbrMADS proteins, suggesting that these proteins might have similar functions. While motif 15 was only identified in the <italic>Bs</italic> subgroup of European pear and motif 17 was only identified in the <italic>SOC1</italic> subgroup of Chinese pear, these motifs might play an important role in the unique MADS-box protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S3, Tables S1 and S2).

To further understand the functional diversity of the MADS-box orthologous genes of two <italic>Pyrus</italic> species, the exon-intron structure of European pear and Chinese pear MADS-box genes was analyzed. Based on the investigation of intron numbers, we discovered that there was a significant difference in the gene structure of the type I and type II MADS-box genes. To sum up, the number of variable introns was found in type II MADS-box genes, such as most MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes contained 2 to 11 introns, and MIKC*-type genes have 8 to 16 introns. However, the type I gene structure was basically no intron (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, S3 and Table S1).

The remaining 16 and 9 genes were localized on the unanchored scaffolds of European pear and Chinese pear, respectively. In European pear, MADS-box genes were distributed across all chromosomes. Chromosome 8 contained the most genes (ten), followed by chromosome 10 (seven), and five genes were distributed on five out of 17 chromosomes (chr 1, 4, 12, 16, and 17). The remaining genes were located on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14 and 15, respectively. Furthermore, only the MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type gene was distributed on chromosome 1. In Chinese pear, chromosome 6 and 8 had the largest number of genes (eight) followed by chromosome 2, 13, 14 and 15 (five), and two genes were found on five out of 16 chromosomes (chr 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9). The remaining genes were located on chromosomes 4, 10, 12, 16 and 17, respectively. Significantly, there were only MIKC<sup>C</sup>-type genes distributed on chromosome 7. Remarkably, the MADS-box gene was distributed on each chromosome of European pear and Chinese pear, except for the Chinese pear chromosome 11. This phenomenon suggested that the MADS-box gene was widely distributed in these two genomes, which might indicated the distribution characteristics of the MADS-box gene family of Rosaceae species. Nevertheless, the distribution of the MADS-box genes on each chromosome was significantly nonrandom in both European pear and Chinese pear. In fact, a relatively high density MADS-box genes appeared on some chromosomes, for example, the European pear chromosome 8 and the Chinese pear chromosome 8, 6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and S4).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Chromosomal locations of European pear MADS-box genes.

Twenty-five and nineteen paralogous gene pairs were detected in European pear and Chinese pear, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Tables S3 and S4). In the pear genome, two WGD events were discovered during the long evolutionary period, which containing an ancient WGD was estimated at ~140 MYA (i.e. Ks~1.5&#x02013;1.8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and a recent WGD was estimated at 30~45 MYA (i.e. Ks~0.15&#x02013;0.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, these events might play an important role in the evolution of the pear MADS-box gene family. To investigate this possibility, we searched for the genetic similarity of the MADS-box flanking sequences (i.e. syntenic blocks) and calculated their Ks values. Moreover, we discarded any Ks values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2.0 due to the risk of saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

In Chinese pear, 8 and 3 paralogous gene pairs might be derived from recent WGD and ancient WGD events, respectively, as well as 8 paralogous gene pairs might be derived from SD events (Tables S5, S6 and S7). A MADS-box gene cluster was defined as a genomic region which containing two or more neighboring MADS-box genes and less than 200&#x02009;kb, as previously reported by Holub&#x02019;s (2001)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

These results suggested that the recent WGD or SD events have contributed to the expansion of the MADS-box gene family members in both European pear and Chinese pear.
