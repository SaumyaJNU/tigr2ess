A recent phenotyping study indicated that the apple rootstock genotypes B.9 and G.935 have contrasting resistance responses to infection by <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic>. In the current study, a comparative transcriptome analysis by Illumina Solexa HiSeq 3000 platform was carried out to identify the global transcriptional regulation networks between the susceptible B.9 and the resistant G.935 to <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection. Thirty-six libraries were sequenced to cover three timepoints after pathogen inoculation, with three biological replicates for each sample. The transcriptomes in the roots of the susceptible genotype B.9 were reflected by overrepresented differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with downregulated patterns and systematic suppression of cellular processes at 48&#x02009;h post inoculation (hpi). In contrast, DEGs with annotated functions, such as kinase receptors, MAPK signaling, JA biosynthesis enzymes, transcription factors, and transporters, were readily induced at 24&#x02009;hpi and continued up-regulation at 48&#x02009;hpi in G.935 roots. The earlier and stronger defense activation is likely associated with an effective inhibition of necrosis progression in G.935 roots. Lack of effector-triggered immunity or existence of a susceptibility gene could contribute to the severely disturbed transcriptome and susceptibility in B.9 roots. The identified DEGs constitute a valuable resource for hypothesis-driven studies to elucidate the resistance/tolerance mechanisms in apple roots and validating their potential association with resistance traits.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Apple orchards: Finding genes that fight infection</title><p id="Par2">The discovery of genetic traits that make certain apple trees resistant to soil pathogens may help generate hardier crops. After apple orchards are replanted, some trees succumb to pathogens and fungi that have accumulated in the soil. To ensure the longevity of orchard sites, researchers want to clarify the genetic makeup of resistant trees. Yanmin Zhu at the United States Department of Agriculture in Wenatchee, US, and co-workers conducted comparative genetic analysis of two apple genotypes (one susceptible, one resistant) during infection with the plant pathogen <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic>. They found that the genotypes have multiple differentially-expressed genes. Key genes and signaling pathways in the susceptible tree&#x02019;s roots were suppressed 48&#x02009;h after infection when the tree was most vulnerable, whereas the resistant tree responded within 24&#x02009;h, upregulating genes that strengthen roots and fight disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>USDA base fund and financial support from Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Apple replant disease (ARD) is a serious hindrance to the establishment of economically viable orchards on replant sites. ARD is caused by a pathogen complex primarily consisting of necrotrophic soilborne oomycetes (<italic>Phytophthora</italic> and <italic>Pythium</italic>) and fungi (<italic>Ilyonectria</italic> and <italic>Rhizoctonia</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among them, <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> is a major component of this pathogen complex in orchard soil worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Pre-plant fumigation of orchard soils to eradicate ARD pathogens has been the primarily available control method for ARD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but the currently available fumigants are under increasingly regulatory restriction due to environmental concerns. In addition to cost, the effects of fumigation are short-lived, and this method is not feasible after orchard establishment. Maximized exploitation of naturally existing resistance traits can offer a more cost-effective and durable control strategy for the management of soilborne diseases in tree fruit production systems. Currently, the conventional breeding for perennial tree crops with the aim of incorporating root resistance traits is a lengthy and resource-demanding process with poor predictability. This is due to the complex disease etiology of ARD, the perennial nature of apple as a tree crop, and the lack of reliable screening methods for root resistance to ARD. Elucidation of the molecular defense activation patterns and identification of key regulatory genes of resistance traits in apple roots could offer the opportunity of molecular marker assisted breeding, which will enhance the precision and efficiency for incorporating resistance traits into new apple rootstocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Maximized immune output requires coordinated re-programming of cellular processes and efficient re-direction of metabolic activities in plant cells. Plants utilize a two-layer immune system to deter pathogen establishment and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Plasma membrane embedded plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize the conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and activate so-called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. PTI is generally considered as a basal, nonspecific response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, adapted pathogens can suppress or bypass PTI through the secretion of evolved effector proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. On the plant side, co-evolved resistance (R) proteins directly or indirectly interact with effectors and initiate the second layer of defense, effector-triggered immunity (ETI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. ETI leads to a stronger and more specific defense response toward those pathogen isolates that produce the recognized effector. These two layers of immune responses include multiple and often overlapping cellular processes, such as the spike of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), defense signaling transduction, defense hormone biosynthesis, generation and transport of secondary metabolites, callose deposition, and secretion of antimicrobial proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Between genotypes within a species, the patterns of defense activation could determine the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Crosstalk between plant hormones plays a key role in tailoring specific and effective defense activation towards different types of attackers. Jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) are well-known defense hormones in response to infection by necrotrophic pathogens. Various families of transcription factors (TFs) have been demonstrated for their critical roles of regulating defense activation in many pathosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For example, JA-inducible R2R3-MYB (myeloblastosis oncogene), WRKY33 (containing signature WRKY amino acid residues) and ethylene responsive factors (ERFs) are essential in activating phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis, and other defense-related pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Specific to apple, phenolic compounds, such as phloridzin, are predominately accumulated in apple leaves in response to pathogen infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of genotype-specific defense activation patterns in apple roots toward infection by necrotrophic soilborne pathogens, are largely unexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

In the current study, comparative transcriptomic analyses were performed using root tissues of equivalent developmental stages between these two genotypes that were simultaneously inoculated with the same preparation of <italic>P. ultimum</italic> inoculum (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The objective was to identify the differentially regulated genes and pathways, which may contribute to the observed phenotypic variations between roots of G.935 and B.9 in response to <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection.

In sharp contrast, a less disturbed transcriptome was observed in the root of the resistant G.935.

A contrasting regulation scheme was observed in susceptible B.9 roots: five out of seven MAPK encoding DEGs were downregulated in the B.9-48 sample, though all four identified DEGs were upregulated in the B.9-72 sample, most of them were newly induced genes. These observations seemed to indicate that factors from <italic>P. ultimum</italic> forced a transcriptional shift specifically in susceptible B.9 roots. MDP0000187103, which encodes a &#x0201c;mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3-like&#x0201d; was consistently upregulated from 24 to 48&#x02009;hpi in G.935. The same gene was upregulated at 24 and 72&#x02009;hpi, however, its induction was interrupted specifically at 48&#x02009;hpi in B.9 roots.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Genotype-specific regulation patterns of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) encoding genes in apple roots during <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> infection.</title><p>Numbers on <italic>Y</italic> axis are the log<sub>2</sub>FC values, which represent the expression changes by comparing those from <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infected tissues and mock-inoculated control tissues.

This study, using RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis, depicted the first panoramic picture of genotype-specific transcriptome changes in apple roots in response to <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection. A recurring theme of transcriptional regulation was observed for several functional groups of genes: after a severe suppression of expression in B.9-48, the additional homologous genes from the same families were upregulated in B.9-72. Such delayed and disrupted defense activation represents a loss of opportunity for organizing an effective defense system in apple roots. One fitting example is the group of DEGs encoding &#x0201c;MATE efflux family protein&#x0201d;. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>, four upregulated DEGs were identified in G.935-24&#x02009;hpi, and none in B.9-24. Then in the B.9-48 samples, four genes were upregulated, but five others were downregulated. Until 72&#x02009;hpi, four genes, which were identical to genes upregulated in G.935-24, were finally upregulated but still with two additional downregulated homologous genes. In contrast, in G.935 roots, a few genes were consistently upregulated at all three timepoints without suppression during <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection. Assuming &#x0201c;MATE efflux family protein&#x0201d; plays a critical role in the timely delivery of antimicrobial metabolites to specific cellular locations for deterring pathogen progression, the delayed or interrupted induction of these genes could be one of the major limiting factors leading to the susceptibility of B.9 roots. Similarly, &#x0201c;sugar transporter SWEET1&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;phosphate transporter&#x0201d;, several gene families of JA biosynthesis enzymes, and TF-encoding genes showed similar regulation patterns of delayed induction in B.9 roots.</p><p id="Par22">Early defense signaling can critically influence the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions because of the potential signal augmentation toward downstream processes. More WAK encoding genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> were upregulated at 24&#x02009;hpi in G.935 compared with B.9 roots, although a larger number of homologous genes were induced in B.9-48 and B.9-72. Most of the identified lectin RLK genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> were upregulated during pathogenesis, but a highly-expressed MDP0000228426 was one of two downregulated lectin RLK encoding genes, which were exclusively identified in B.9-48. Among other categories of &#x0201c;receptor kinases&#x0201d;, such as &#x0201c;cysteine-rich receptor&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinases&#x0201d;, high ratios of downregulated members were almost always identified from the B.9-48 data subset. The MAPK signaling cascade plays a crucial role in various biotic and abiotic stress responses, through hormone-mediated induction of WRKY22 and WRKY29<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.

A &#x0201c;mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3-like&#x0201d; (MDP0000187103) demonstrated specific suppression at B.9-48, while in contrast, the same gene was consistently upregulated at G.935-24 and G.935-48. Disease resistance proteins function as the cytoplasmic receptors for recognizing specific pathogen effectors and activating a stronger and more specific immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. From the current dataset, more than three dozen of genes involved in resistance reaction were exclusively downregulated in B.9-48, indicating a stage-dependent suppression. A previous report indicated that a preformed molecular defense network may exist in pre-inoculated apple root tissues, as suggested by more abundant <italic>R</italic>-gene transcripts in G.935 root tissues than in B.9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Such pre-existing defense systems could be critical for initiating earlier and stronger defense activation to deter pathogen attacks in G.935 roots at the early stage of infection. Both pre-existing and induced molecular defense networks likely contribute to the effective resistance responses leading to pathogen deterrence.</p><p id="Par23">It has been well established that JA and ET function as the primary defense hormones in response to infection by necrotrophic pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In the apple root-<italic>P. ultimum</italic> pathosystem, the regulation of ET biosynthesis was not remarkably different between B.9 and G.935. On the other hand, a timely and effective JA biosynthesis might be one of the primary reasons leading to enhanced defense system in G.935 roots after <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection. The direct connection between the robust JA biosynthesis and efficient ETI in apple roots could benefit from careful analysis in the future. The roles of TFs in the plant immune response have been well elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the current study, DEGs encoding the members of four major TF families, WRKY, bHLH, AP2/ERF, and MYB, seemed to be targeted at transcriptional suppression in B.9 roots, particularly at 48&#x02009;hpi. Similar &#x0201c;stage-dependent&#x0201d; suppression was rarely observed in G.935 roots. The delayed and interrupted defense activation was reflected by the downregulation of genes of several other functional groups, including genes for WAKs, MAPKs, and R-proteins and JA biosynthesis enzymes.</p><p id="Par24">The timing and intensity of defense activation could directly impact the &#x0201c;chemical warfare&#x0201d; between plant cells and invading pathogens. The effective resistance responses require coordinated activation of a well-connected defense network without interruption. It was known that PTI-activated and ETI-activated defense responses share many features, but with different amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, including callose and lignin synthesis, and the production of phytoalexins and PR proteins. Based on the observations from this dataset, the early and non-interrupted induction of genes that encode WAKs, MAPK, TFs, JA biosynthesis enzymes, and MATE efflux family proteins, may represent an effective ETI, which is operational in infected G.935 roots, while the opposite could be the case in B.9. Due to the potential functional hierarchy among these proteins, it is tempting to speculate the roles of their co-regulation patterns. For example, it was known that Arabidopsis WRKY-33 is the phosphorylation substrate for MPK3/MPK6; in turn WRKY33 directly regulates the camalexin biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">The effect of potential pathogenic effectors from <italic>P. ultimum</italic> on the widespread transcriptional suppression in B.9-48 samples are beyond the scope of the current study. Lacking efficient detoxification processes in the root cells may also account for the observed systematic suppression of multiple cellular pathways. One noticeable feature of this dataset is that a relative smaller number of DEGs was identified from G.935-72. It can be speculated that the quick and consistent defense activation at the early stage (24 and 48&#x02009;hpi) may result in the sufficient deterrence of pathogen progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, the smaller portion of tissues were still experiencing active pathogenesis at 72&#x02009;hpi in the resistant G.935 root.</p><p id="Par26">With the longer paired-end sequence reads and three biological replicates, this comprehensive dataset offers a high-resolution global view of genotype-specific transcriptome changes associated with defense activation in apple roots during <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection for the first time. The results revealed two distinct scenarios: (i) a quicker, stronger, and consistent defense response pattern in G.935 roots, and (ii) a slower, weaker, and interrupted pattern in B.9 roots. It is possible that pathogen effectors or toxins from <italic>P. ultimum</italic> is responsible for selective suppression of specific members in a gene family in the B.9-48 sample. Then, to compensate or recover the disrupted cellular functions, another new set of genes from the same families were activated in B.9-72. Such a delayed and/or interrupted process could be detrimental to effective defense activation, because the loss of momentum in the weakened defense system, B.9 roots were eventually overpowered by the attacking pathogen. In contrast, the earlier, stronger, and non-interrupted defense activation effectively restricts the pathogen progression in G.935 root. The ultimate defense output depends on the coordinated and synchronized activation of genes that are required to establish the successful execution of PTI and/or ETI. Results from the current study suggest that efficient and coordinated activation of several molecular components are needed for a successful resistance response, including early signal transduction (RLKS, MAPKs, and R-proteins), biosynthesis of defense hormone (JA and ET) and secondary metabolites (CHI and UGT), defense related TFs (WRKY, bHLH, ERF, and MYB), and transporters (ABC transporter and MATE efflux family protein). The results from the current study set the foundation for future hypothesis-driven studies for validating the association of these candidate genes with apple root resistance traits.</p><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par27">This communication contributes to the unraveling of the global transcriptional networks in root cells of apple rootstock genotypes that are resistant or susceptible to <italic>P. ultimum</italic> infection. The comprehensive dataset from this comparative transcriptome analysis revealed contrasting scenarios between these two genotypes. The more dramatically disturbed transcriptomes in the roots of the susceptible genotype B.9 reflected an overwhelmingly larger number of downregulated DEGs at 48&#x02009;hpi, a critical stage for this pathosystem. In contrast, a majority of the DEGs were upregulated in the less agitated G.935 root transcriptome. Several groups of genes encoding proteins functioning at key steps of defense activation were often readily upregulated at 24&#x02009;dpi in roots of G.935, but the upregulation of their homologues was often delayed until 72&#x02009;hpi in B.9 roots, likely due to the severe suppression at 48&#x02009;hpi. Such genes included those encoding kinase receptors, MAPK, JA biosynthesis enzymes, TFs, UGTs, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transporters. These observations indicated that a quicker, stronger, and more consistent defense activation created an effective ETI and/or efficient detoxification capacity in the roots of G.935, inhibiting the progression of necrosis caused by <italic>P. ultimum</italic>. In contrast, lack of an effective ETI and inability to detoxify the pathogen&#x02019;s phytotoxins due to delayed and interrupted defense responses, could have resulted in the observed vulnerability of susceptible B.9 roots. The systematic suppression of the primary metabolism in susceptible B.9 roots at the key stage of 48&#x02009;hpi, including glycolysis and many other cellular processes, disrupted the supply of cellular energy and metabolic precursors. Detailed understanding of the mechanisms behind such wide-spread suppression is still largely elusive, but a possible explanation may be the existence of a susceptibility gene in B.9, but not G.935. The identified DEGs from this study are valuable source of candidate genes for investigating their association with resistance traits among a wider selection of apple rootstock germplasm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Preparation of apple plants by tissue culture procedure</title><p id="Par28">Tissue culture based micro-propagation procedures were used to obtain individual apple plants for both B.9 and G.935 apple rootstock genotypes as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, as it is impossible to produce genetically uniform apple plants by seed germination.
