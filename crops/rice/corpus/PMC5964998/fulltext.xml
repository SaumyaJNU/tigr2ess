This technique has successfully mediated the silencing of interested genes in plants such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, petunia, etc. In order to establish the MIGS technology system in monocots such as rice, we constructed the MIGS backbone vectors pZHY930, pZHY931, pZHY932, and pZHY933 with different with promoters to regulate the expression of miR173 and miR173_ts. The rice OsPDS reporter gene was selected to compare the efficiency of four MIGS backbone vectors by the ratio of albino plants. The results showed that all the four backbone vectors could effectively mediate the target gene silencing, and pZHY932 showed highest efficiency up to 90%. Through MIGS silencing of endogenous OsROC5 and OsLZAY1 in rice, we successfully obtained rice mutant plants with rice leaf roll and tillering angles increasing, and further confirmed that MIGS backbone vector can efficiently mediate target gene silencing in rice. On the other hand, in order to verify the efficiency of MIGS-mediated multi-gene silencing in rice, we constructed two double-gene silencing vectors OsPDS and OsROC5, OsPDS and OsLZAY1, based on pZHY932 backbone vector. Double mutant rice plants with increased leaf and albino tiller angles. And we successfully obtained bladed leaf albino seedling and increased tillering angle albino seedling double-silencing mutations. We further constructed a MIGS-OsGBSS gene silencing vector and obtained rice materials with significantly reduced amylose content. This result indicated that MIGS could be an efficient method in monocots gene silencing and gene function analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>starch</kwd><kwd>MIGS</kwd><kwd>OsGBSS</kwd><kwd>amylose content</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly conserved biological process in which the 20&#x02013;30 nt small RNA molecules (sRNA) inhibit gene expression by causing the degradation of specific mRNA molecules (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fire et al., 1998</xref>). Since its discovery in 1990s, RNAi has been widely used in the research and application of the functional genomics of animals and plants. Endogenous sRNA in living cells is widespread, according to the characteristics of its precursors; we divided sRNA into two main types: microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Both of them are length 20&#x02013;25 nt, and produce by Dicer or DCL (Dicer-like) which are similar to RNase III (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2003</xref>). SiRNAs derive from fully complementary double stranded RNA and have a typical sequence diversity. The miRNAs processes by the pri-miRNA with the hairpin structure as well as typical sequence specificity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Xie and Qi, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Voinnet, 2009</xref>). There are many kinds of siRNAs, according to the different types of the precursor sequence and the mechanism of formation, they can be divided into several types, include tasiRNA (<italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNA), natsiRNA (natural antisense transcript-derived siRNAs), hcsiRNA (heterochromatic siRNA), rasiRNA (repeat-associated siRNA) and others.</p><p>tasiRNA is a special siRNAs in higher plants, which generates from precursor transcripts by the specific miRNA/AGO (ARGONAUTE protein) complexes guided cleavage, and converts to dsRNA, and then processes into short 21 nt long RNA duplexes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Peragine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>). tasiRNA is a combination of miRNA and siRNA silencing pathway, which has the characteristics of both siRNAs and miRNAs. Like siRNAs, tasiRNA undergo similar processing and arise from dsRNA, and their generation are both RDR6 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6) dependent (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>). However, tasiRNA like miRNAs binds with less sequence specificity to their targets, and does not require full sequence complementarity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Peragine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Yoshikawa et al., 2005</xref>). In Arabidopsis there are four families of tasiRNA genes (TAS loci), and different miRNAs corresponded to different TAS genes (TAS1, TAS2 corresponding miR173, TAS3 corresponding miR390, and TAS4 corresponding miR828) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</xref>). TAS1 and TAS2 transcripts undergo miR173-guided cleavage by AGO1 at the 5&#x02032; end, dsRNA synthesis by RDR6, and generates the 21-nt siRNA by DCL4 to target complementary mRNAs. The TAS4 family is similar to that of TAS1 and TAS2, except for the guided miR828. Compared with those single mRNA binding family, TAS3 transcripts require the guide miR390 bind the transcript at two sites, and then cleave at the 3&#x02032; binding site only by AGO7 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gasciolli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Axtell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nakazawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez de Alba et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MIGS (miRNA-induced gene silencing) is an efficient technique to induce gene silencing in Arabidopsis, tobacco, soybean, and petunia (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felippes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref>). By fusing a 22 nt long miR173 target site (miR173_ts) to the 5&#x02032; end of the target gene fragment, we constructed the MIGS vector through simply PCR reaction. Since the guide miR173 can incorporate into the same MIGS vector, the co-expression of guide miR173 and miR173_ts-target fragment lead MIGS can be used in any plant species. MIGS can also be used in multiple-gene silencing with a single vector by directly link the miR173_ts to different target fragments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felippes et al., 2012</xref>). Compared with other gene silencing methods, VIGS requires specific viral vectors, which limited to a few hosts. In hpRNAi, the inserted gene fragment needs to be cloned as an inverted repeat sequences. amiRNA designing usually requires multiple PCR reactions to replace mature miRNA in precursor backbone. MIGS offers an effective and more convenient sRNA silencing approach than hpRNA, amiNRA and VIGS. However, there is no research investigate the efficiency mechanisms in monocot plants.</p><p>Here, we provide an efficient alternative to monocot gene silencing strategies. Based on tasiRNA MIGS principle and monocot specific expression cascade, we constructed three different monocot MIGS backbones. By using rice endogenous gene OsPDS (Rice phytoene desaturase precursor, GenBank Accession No. AF049356) as visible reporter, we evaluated the efficiency of different backbones, and obtained OsPDS, OsROC5 (Rice outermost cell-specific 5 gene, GenBank Accession No. AB101648), OsLAZY1 (Rice shoot gravitropism gene, GenBank Accession No. DQ855268) silencing rice mutants through monocot MIGS system. Meanwhile, we detected the monocot multiple MIGS system by achieving the OsPDS-OsROC5 and OsPDS-OsLAZY1 dual mutant rice. Furthermore, we successfully knocked down the rice OsGBSS (Rice granule bound starch synthase 1 gene, GenBank Accession No. FJ235787) gene expression by MIGS technology, and obtained the transgenic rice less seeds with significant decrease in amylose content. These indicate that MIGS technology has a wide range of application prospects in rice research and breeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Material and Growth Condition</title><p><italic>Oryza sativa</italic> Japonica Group cultivar Nipponbare was used as the wild type and transformation host.

We used MIGS technology to silence OsGBSS gene which regulated the synthesis of amylose content in rice to obtain low amylose rice seeds. The MIGS-OsGBSS vector pZHY932::OsGBSS was constructed based on the most efficient backbone pZHY932 and the first exon of the OsGBSS gene was used as the target fragment (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref></bold>).

As long as the 22nt miR173_ts target site linked to the gene-silenced target fragment, the guide miR173 is sufficient to trigger the <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNA reaction, which in turn causes the silencing of the target gene. On the other hand, the size of the target gene fragment used in MIGS is about 200&#x02013;500 nt, and the size of the fragment can effectively induce the silencing of the target gene, which makes the construction of MIGS vector very simple and requires only one step of PCR reaction achieve. In addition, MIGS can not only silence multiple homologous genes, but also very simply silence multiple different genes at the same time. It is only need to connect multiple MiR173_ts sequences to fragments of different target genes, respectively. Thus MIGS has been successfully used in tobacco, Arabidopsis, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, soybean, petunia, and other plants for gene silencing (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felippes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Benstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Imin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref>). Fellipes first studied miR173-mediated MIGS in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and tobacco, and MIGS can effectively induce single gene, double gene silencing in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Felippes et al., 2012</xref>). Benstein used MIGS to silence the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase I (PGDH1) gene in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and the transgenic positive plants showed significant growth inhibition (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Benstein et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the C-terminal protein 1 (CEP1) gene of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> was successfully silenced by the MIGS2.1 vector (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Imin et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been reported that the expression of CHS (chalcone synthase) and PDS (phytoene desaturase) gene was successfully inhibited by the MIGS technique in petunia, and the white albino plants were obtained (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We successfully established a simple and efficient MIGS system for single and multiple gene silencing in monocot plant rice. We constructed four different backbone vectors pZHY930, pZHY931, pZHY932, and pZHY933 by altering the promoters of the control guide miR173 and miR173_ts sequences, and the efficiency of induction of gene silencing in four backbone vectors had been compared and evaluated by using OsPDS, OsROC5, and OsLAZY1 genes as reporter genes. After comparing the data, we found that most of the PCR-positive plantlets of pZHY930 appeared normal green phenotype like control plants, miR173_ts transcription pattern in pZHY930 was not suitable for monocot expression in MIGS technique. In pZHY931 backbone, replacement of original CaMV 35S promoter of miR173_ts with monocot maize ZmUbi promoter, MIGS gene silencing rate increased significantly, which suggested that the monocot constitutive promoter was apparently more suitable for the miR173_ts and target gene expression in rice than the dicot promoter. In pZHY932 backbone, the controlling expression of guide miR173 was replaced by strong constitutive promoter CaMV 35S, which guaranteed the expression of miR173 was significantly increased and the gene-silencing effect was dramatically raised to 90%. It indicated that increasing the expression of guide miR173 by strong promoter 35S might be critical to improving gene silencing efficiency. However, it was unexpected that the pZHY933 backbone vector which had the monocot constitutive promoter OsACT to manipulate the guide miR173 expressing had not shown highly gene silencing efficiency as expected. The reason remained unclear and needed to further experimental analysis.</p><p>In addition to visible reporter gene OsPDS, we also successfully silenced the endogenous OsRoc5 and OsLAZY1 genes in rice, and obtained the corresponding gene mutant phenotype. We also successfully silenced the endogenous Roc5 and LAZY1 genes of rice, and all of them obtained the corresponding gene defect phenotype. The first phenotypes of outcurve leaf (oul1) found in T-DNA insertion mutant in OsROC5 gene. Roc5 leaves slightly spiraled at the five-leaf stage and gradually curved toward the abaxial surface. Roc5 contains nine exons and eight introns, and the T-DNA was inserted into the sixth intron in knockout of ROC5 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). In four MIGS-ROC5 vectors, the 319 bp target gene fragment was include all the seventh exon and partial eighth exon according to the full sequence of ROC5 gene. ROC5 gene expression was successfully interference, and MIGS-ROC5 gene silencing plantlets showing abaxial leaf rolling like the ROC5 knockout mutant. LAZY1 gene plays a negative role in polar auxin transport (PAT), which regulated shoot gravitropism by controlling the rice tiller angle. LAZY1 mutant rice enhanced PAT greatly and thus alters the endogenous IAA distribution in shoots, leading to the reduced gravitropism, and therefore the tiller-spreading phenotype of rice plants (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2007</xref>). The MIGS-LAZY1 plantlets had a larger branching angle, as expected. This demonstrated that the MIGS system can come to universal usage in rice.</p><p>The advantage of MIGS technology was that it was easier to co-silence multiple genes simultaneously, and convenient to construct a multi-gene silencing vector only by one-step fusion PCR. In this study, we examined the co-silencing of OsPDS and OsROC5, OsPDS, and OsLZAY1 genes using the most efficient backbone vector pZHY932. We had successfully obtained albino and leaf-rolling plants, as well as plants with increased branching angles and white leaves. The pZHY932 MIGS backbone provided a new experimental program for multiple gene silencing.</p><p>Since MIGS technology could achieve the silence of single gene and multiply gene in rice, we applied it to study the quality improvement of rice starch. The composition of rice starch is amylose and amylopectin, and the ratio of amylose and amylopectin is an important research direction of rice breeding. Granular bound starch synthase (GBSS) is encoded by waxy gene (Wx), which mainly controls the synthesis of amylose in rice endosperm (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Craig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Geigenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Obana et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Seferoglu et al., 2014</xref>). In 1990, Wang cloned rice Wx gene and proved its function in starch synthesis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 1999</xref>). Takeda used antisense RNA to inhibit the expression of Wx gene and reduced the activity of GBSS, resulting in a significant reduction in amylose content in rice seeds (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, it was possible to change the starch composition of rice by silencing GBSS gene and reducing the amount of amylose in rice endosperm by MIGS technology. In this study, we selected the pZHY932 backbone with the highest silencing efficiency to construct the OsGBSS MIGS vector. The pZHY932::OsGBSS transgenic positive lines successfully reduced the expression of GBSS in plants. The amylose content in the transgenic seed endosperm decreased from 24.53 to 16.38%, the down-regulation proportion reached 33.2%, which was significantly different from that in the control. It indicated that MIGS technology had effectively achieved the down-regulation of amylose content in rice grains. Interestingly, although MIGS causes OsGBSS gene silencing and amylose content decrease, there was no significant effect on total starch content. The decreased amylose content might compensate by the increased amylopectin, which suggested that the synthesis network of rice starch was complex, it could be moderately regulated.</p><p>Compared with the efficiency of single gene silencing (60&#x02013;95%), MIGS-induced OsGBSS gene down-regulation efficiency was lower than that of OsPDS, OsROC5, and OsLAZY1 genes. This should relate to the selection of MIGS interfering target sites, and the specificity of target gene fragments. There were also significant differences in the silencing efficiency of different species and different tasiRNA target sites. Generally, target sites with high sequence homology and specificity are more efficient for interfering certain gene. In addition, because of the large number of genes controlling starch traits, the complex metabolic regulation network, and the complementary function of gene family members, the effect of regulating a single gene of the starch synthesis pathway was often more complex than expected. This suggests that we could co-silence multiple genes in the starch synthesis pathway in further studies and regulate the starch composition more conveniently. MIGS could also combine with other co-expression techniques, such as gene stacking technology, to achieve precise regulation of gene expression in monocotyledonous plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RNAi as a highly efficient and specific technical method was widely used in animal and plant genomic function research. There were many types of RNAi technology; different RNA-mediated gene silencing efficiency was also different. MIGS was the interference technology by miRNA-mediated, tasiRNA binding degradation of the target gene that had emerged in plants in recent years. It had a simple construction steps and high efficiency in gene silence. It could simultaneously silence multiple unrelated genes or the same metabolic pathway of different regulatory genes to study the regulation of specific gene function in the organism. In the presence of effective tasiRNA, targeted gene silencing could be achieved in any species.</p><p>By changing different monocotyledon promoters to control expression of guide miR173 and miR173-ts sequences, we successfully constructed a backbone vector pZHY932 and MIGS system for efficient gene silencing in monocotyledonous plant rice. The single gene or double gene silencing of different rice endogenous genes verified the stability, efficiency and ease use of system in rice. At the same time, the rice-amylose synthesis gene OsGBSS down regulated by the MIGS system, and its applicability in rice genetic improvement breeding was verified. This interesting, efficient and simple method could be widely used in monocotyledonous plants such as rice.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XZ and YZ conceived and designed the experiments.
