    "NADPH oxidase (Nox) is a critical enzyme involved in the generation of apoplastic superoxide (O2-), a type of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hence regulate a wide range of biological functions in many organisms. Plant Noxes are the homologs of the catalytic subunit from mammalian NADPH oxidases and are known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rbohs). Previous studies have highlighted their versatile roles in tackling different kind of stresses and in plant growth and development. In the current study, potential interacting partners and phosphorylation sites were predicted for Rboh proteins from two model species (10 Rbohs from Arabidopsis thaliana and 9 from Oryza sativa japonica). The present work is the first step towards in silico prediction of interacting partners and phosphorylation sites for Rboh proteins from two plant species.In this work, an extensive range of potential partners (unique and common), leading to diverse functions were revealed from interaction networks and gene ontology classifications, where majority of AtRbohs and OsRbohs play role in stress-related activities, followed by cellular development. Further, 68 and 38 potential phosphorylation sites were identified in AtRbohs and OsRbohs, respectively. Their distribution, location and kinase specificities were also predicted and correlated with experimental data as well as verified with the other EF-hand containing proteins within both genomes.Analysis of regulatory mechanisms including interaction with diverse partners and post-translational modifications like phosphorylation have provided insights regarding functional multiplicity of Rbohs. The bioinformatics-based workflow in the current study can be used to get insights for interacting partners and phosphorylation sites from Rbohs of other plant species."
