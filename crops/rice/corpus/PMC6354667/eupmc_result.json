    "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in regulating many biological processes. In this study, tomato seeds were first irradiated by neutrons. Eight tomato mutants were then selected and infected by Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). RNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analyses identified 1,563 tomato lncRNAs. About half of the lncRNAs were derived from intergenic regions, whereas antisense lncRNAs accounted for 35%. There were fewer lncRNAs identified in our study than in other studies identifying tomato lncRNAs. Functional classification of 794 lncRNAs associated with tomato genes showed that many lncRNAs were associated with binding functions required for interactions with other molecules and localized in the cytosol and membrane. In addition, we identified 19 up-regulated and 11 down-regulated tomato lncRNAs by comparing TYLCV infected plants to non-infected plants using previously published data. Based on these results, the lncRNAs identified in this study provide important resources for characterization of tomato lncRNAs in response to TYLCV infection."
