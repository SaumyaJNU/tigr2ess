    "As plants are sessile they need a very efficient system for repairing damage done by external or internal mutagens to their DNA. Mismatch repair (MMR) is one of the systems that maintain genome integrity and prevent homeologous recombination. In all eukaryotes mismatches are recognized by evolutionary conserved MSH proteins often acting as heterodimers, the constant component of which is MSH2. Changes affecting the function of MSH2 gene may induce a 'mutator' phenotype and microsatellite instability (MSI), as is demonstrated in MSH2 knock-out and silenced lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. The goal of this study was to screen for 'mutator' phenotypes in somatic hybrids between potato cvs. 'Delikat' and 'Désirée' and MMR deficient Solanum chacoense transformed using antisense (AS) or dominant negative mutant (DN) AtMSH2 genes. The results demonstrate that first generation fusion hybrids have a range of morphological abnormalities caused by uniparental MMR deficiency; these mutant phenotypes include: dwarf or gigantic plants; bushiness; curled, small, large or abnormal leaves; a deterioration in chloroplast structure; small deep-purple tubers and early dehiscent flowers. Forty percent of the viable somatic hybrids planted in a greenhouse, (10 out of 25 genotypes) had mutant phenotypes accompanied by MSI. The majority of the hybrids with 'mutator' phenotypes cultured on media containing kanamycin developed roots so sustaining the presence of selectable marker gene nptII, from the initial constructs. Here for the first time, MMR deficiency combined with somatic hybridization, are used to induce new phenotypes in plants, which supports the role of MMR deficiency in increasing introgressions between two related species."
