During the last three decades, the farming areas and rice production in the delta have increased rapidly, to satisfy the food demand of the increasing national population and to generate export earnings. The total rice cropping area in the Mekong Delta increased from approximately 1.2 million hectares in 1995 to approximately 1.7 million hectares in 2013, while the rice yield increased from 4.0 to 5.8 ton/ha/crop during the same period of time (GSO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>). In Vietnam, the rice production increased from 26.4 million tons in 1996 to 44.1 million tons in 2013 (GSO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>). Strategies for increased rice production have mainly relied on intensified farming methods, supported by high-yield rice varieties and increased use of agrochemicals, especially pesticides (Huan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Phong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2010</xref>). Hoi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>) indicated that the pesticides imported to Vietnam have increased from 100 tons per year in the 1950s to the highest of approximately 150,000 tons in 2008 and then dropped to 103,500 tons in 2012. The number of active ingredients has increased from 294 in 2002 to 1085 in 2011 (MARD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Although the increased use of pesticides has helped to increase the rice yields, it has also been followed by an increased risk for negative effects on the environment and on people&#x02019;s health (Berg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>; Sebesvari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Dasgupta et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>), Ky and Ngoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1998</xref>), and Thuy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2003</xref>) indicated that the use of pesticides in the Mekong Delta can cause adverse impacts on human health, including skin and eye irritation, headache, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Several other studies also found negative impacts of pesticides on human health in the North of Vietnam (Ky and Ngoc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1998</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>; Phung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). Many farmers have three crops per year and often use several different pesticides per crop. Pesticides are often applied in combination, to reduce the working time in the field and with the expectation to prevent several crop diseases at the same time. The combination of different pesticides could potentially result in &#x0201c;cocktail&#x0201d; effects on aquatic organisms in the rice fields. The combined toxic effects may differ from the effect of the separate pesticides, and could be additive or non-additive. In addition, pesticides are spread to other areas, through wind drift and irrigation channels, exposing aquatic organisms to a variety of different pesticides. Although the water concentrations of many sprayed pesticides are not likely to cause any acute toxic effects on aquatic organisms, they may still generate long-term lethal and sub-lethal effects such as reduced growth rate, feeding capability, and swimming activity (Stadlinger et al. 2015).</p><p id="Par4">Anh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) indicate that wild fish resources, such as climbing perch and snakehead fish in rice fields and floodplains of the Mekong, have declined by 70% compared to 30&#x000a0;years ago. One of the main causes of this decline is the high use of pesticides (Anh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>). However, official information about the negative side effects of pesticides on aquatic organisms in the rice fields from the Mekong Delta is scarce.</p><p id="Par5">This study therefore aims to assess how some pesticides commonly used on rice affects fish in the Mekong Delta. Organophosphates (OPs), such as chlorpyrifos ethyl (CPF), and carbamates (CMs), such as fenobucarb (F), are popular insecticides used by many rice farmers. According to the list of registered pesticides in 2013, approximately 158 and 40 different pesticides contain CPF and F, respectively, as the main active ingredients, and are used to control a wide range of pests in the rice fields (Heong et al. 1998; Huan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>; Phong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2010</xref>; MARD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>). These pesticides are often detected in fresh water systems in the Mekong Delta (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). Toan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2013</xref>) found fenobucarb to be the most frequently detected insecticides (found in 91% of the samples) in rice field water in the Mekong Delta, with a median concentration of 0.11&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The water concentration can be much higher directly after the pesticides are applied to the rice field, but decrease quickly within a couple of days (Stadlinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>; Tam et al. 2015, 2016a, b). Tam et al. (2015, 2016a, b) found that the concentrations of CPF in rice field water sprayed with 0.64&#x000a0;kg CPF/ha varied between 4.23 and 5.35&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L after 1&#x000a0;h and 0.47 and 0.73&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L after 1&#x000a0;day, respectively. Tam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016a</xref>) also found that the concentrations of F in rice field water sprayed with 1.5&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;F/ha were 135&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L after 1&#x000a0;h and 36&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L after 1&#x000a0;day.</p><p id="Par6">The concentration of CPF and F in water is influenced by the amount of insecticides sprayed and on the water volume in the rice field (Tam et al. 2015, 2016a, b; Toan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2013</xref>). Tam et al. (2015, 2016a, b) found that the highest water concentrations were found among the rice plants in the fields that received the highest application doses, while the lowest water concentrations were found in the canal of the fields. This was probably because the insecticides were sprayed directly on the rice plants and not on the canal. The larger water volume of the canals probably also diluted the applied insecticides (Tam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>). Toan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2013</xref>) proposed that the slightly higher pesticide levels found during the dry season could be due to the lower water volume during this period of time.</p><p id="Par7">Both CPF and F are known to be highly toxic to freshwater fish and aquatic invertebrates, because of their abilities to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme and to cause malformation of the nervous system (O&#x02019;Brien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1976</xref>; Peakall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1992</xref>; Taylor and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1999</xref>; Tilak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2001</xref>). Gruber and Munn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1998</xref>) indicated that, although OP and CM compounds can break down rapidly in the environment, non-target organisms may suffer from chronic effects, including AChE inhibition, for several months in contaminated areas, such as intensive rice farming, where pesticides are applied continuously. According to Peakall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1992</xref>), inhibition of AChE results in abnormal respiration, swimming, feeding, and social interactions in aquatic organisms, due to loss of coordination, tremors, muscle spasms, convulsions, and even death.</p><p id="Par8">AChE activity in fish has been used as a biomarker for OP and CM environmental contaminations for many years (Assis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>; Lionetto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). The successful application of this biomarker for monitoring of human health also suggests that it can be used in overall risk assessments of OP and CM compounds, addressing both environmental and health risks. In addition, Lionetto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>) revealed several advantages of using AChE as a biomarker: the response is easy to measure, it shows a dose-dependent behavior to pollutant exposure, it is sensitive, and it exhibits a link to health effects. However, using AChE as a biomarker to indicate the degree of sub-lethal effects from OPs and CMs on aquatic organisms in natural environments requires baseline information on the normal AChE activity levels in unexposed organisms, which may be very difficult to find in the field. Moreover, the effect on the AChE activity depends on a number of factors such as species, age, and sex.</p><p id="Par9">To monitor the negative side effects of insecticides on fish in the Mekong Delta, it was seen as important to select an indigenous species that is commonly found in the whole delta. Rice fields are natural and important habitats for climbing perch <italic>(Anabas testudineus)</italic>, and this fish species is directly exposed to pesticide levels that can cause negative impacts during all its life stages (Tam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015a</xref>; Stadlinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). Although there are no official reports about the status of climbing perch populations in the Mekong Delta, the perception among local farmers is that the amount of wild fish in rice fields has decreased during the last 25&#x000a0;years (Edwards et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1997</xref>; Anh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>; Klemick and Lichtenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>), which could be due to the increased use of pesticides in the delta. Climbing perch is a supplementary source of food and income for many local households, and the declining yield of this species affects the local people&#x02019;s livelihood and well-being. Climbing perch has been shown to be an important predator of rice pests, such as brown planthopper (<italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (St&#x000e5;l)), and could potentially help to reduce the use of insecticides to control these pests (Nam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). Choudhury et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1993</xref>) found that non-lethal levels of metacid-50 (0.106&#x000a0;ppb) and carbaryl (1.66&#x000a0;ppm) insecticides significantly reduced the gonadosomatic index and the profiles of estradiol-17&#x003b2; in the plasma and ovary of adult, female climbing perch. Jilna and John (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>) found that the exposure to sub-lethal concentration of methyl parathion (2.7&#x000a0;mg/L) not only influenced behavioral activities but also significantly reduced the level of protein content in the fore brain of climbing perch. Binoy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) carried out an experiment to investigate the impact of dicofol on the behavior of climbing perch including respiratory rate, swimming performance, feeding behavior, and learning ability. The negative impacts of diazinon on climbing perch using muscle cholinesterase were studied by Cong and Linh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). Thus, there are several studies on the effects of pesticides on climbing perch, but information regarding the effects of CPF and F are scarce. The main purpose of this study was, thus, to investigate the negative impacts of Vitashield 40EC (CPF) and Bassa 50EC (F) applied alone and in a mixture on the brain activity of acetylcholinesterase in climbing perch.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Test animals</title><p id="Par10">The tested fish (3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;g) used in the experiment was purchased from a fish farm in the Co Do district outside the Can Tho city in Vietnam.

This lack of information is of major concern, as the ongoing intensification of agriculture must take into account the potential negative effects by pesticides on the regions fisheries resources, including the fast growing aquaculture industry, to avoid unwanted tradeoffs in the overall yield and quality of agriculture and aquaculture products from the delta (Berg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>; Berg and Tam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par26">This study shows that commonly used insecticides, such as Vitashield 40EC (CPF) and Bassa 50EC (F), applied separately and in mixtures, caused a significant inhibition of the brain AChE activity in climbing perch fingerlings. Although the concentrations did not cause any direct mortalities among the exposed fish, they were associated with sub-lethal changes in the physiology and behavior that may impair the survival, development, and reproduction of the fish (Kegley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). This is of a special concern in the Mekong Delta because farmers often run three crops and spray their fields several times per crop, implying that aquatic organisms in the rice fields may continuously be exposed to and stressed by, elevated levels of pesticides in the water (cf. Stadlinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). The lower oxygen levels in the water with the exposed fish indicate that the fish used an increased amount of energy (increased respiration) to counteract the negative impacts from insecticides, implying that less energy was used for growth. Arunachalam and Palanichamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1982</xref>) proposed that reduced growth is a sensitive indication of chronic toxicity to CPF. Tam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015a</xref>) also found a reduced growth in climbing perch exposed to CPF in rice fields in the Mekong Delta. Hegazi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1898</xref>) found that high levels of CPF decreased not only the brain AChE activity but also the glycogen and blood glucose levels in the muscles and liver in <italic>Clarias lazera</italic>. An earlier field study showed that CPF at concentration below 10% of the concentration used in this study (below the detection limit of &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) caused 70% inhibition of the brain AChE activity and was associated with both reduced growth and survival rates in climbing perch in rice fields in the Mekong Delta (Tam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015a</xref>). The reasons why no mortalities were found in this study could be due to a lower stress under the more controlled laboratory conditions, and that the experiment period was not long enough to capture these delayed effects.</p><p id="Par27">Other signs of sub-lethal effects found during the experiment included lowered activity, erratic swimming, and rapid grill movements, which is similar to many earlier reported behavior changes of the exposed fish, such as reduced feeding capability, swimming activity, avoidance of predators, and spatial orientation (Pan and Dutta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1998</xref>; Sancho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2000</xref>; Richendrfer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">The results from this study also indicate that the recovery of the brain AChE activity is quicker in fish exposed to only F than when exposed to a mixture of CPF and F or only CPF. An explanation to this could be that carbamates, such as F, inhibit AChE reversibly (Assis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>), while the inhibition by CPF often is stronger and more irreversible (Assis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). Tam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016b</xref>) found that under field conditions, climbing perch fingerling showed full recovery of the AChE activity 14&#x000a0;days after exposure to a mixture of CPF and F, while the inhibition of the brain AChE activity in climbing perch fingerlings exposed to a similar concentration of only CPF was still above 50% after 12&#x000a0;days with no clear signs of recovery (Tam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015a</xref>). The recovery of the AChE activity in fish is probably because the amount of bioavailable CPF and F in water decreases with time and due to physiology responses by the fish.</p><p id="Par29">Also, the oxygen levels in the different treatments indicate that the fish exposed to only CPF were more stressed (higher respiration compared to the other treatments and the control), at the end of the experiment (day 5 and 7), but were less stressed compared to the other treatments during the first days of the experiment. The comparatively lower initial increase in the respiration by fish treated with only CPF could be because CPF must be activated to form an oxon metabolites via desulfurization reactions to become a potent cholinesterase inhibitor (Chambers and Carr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). A recent field study, where climbing perch fingerlings were first exposed to F and later to CPF, confirms that the inhibition of the brain AChE activity by F is quicker but shorter than the effect from CPF (Tam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016a</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Thus, the combined long-term toxicity effect (&#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;day) by a mixture of CPF and F seems to be lower than the effect from only CPF, because of a less prolonged inhibition of the AChE brain activity by the mixture. This reduced effect is contradictory to several previous studies, which found synergistic effects from the combined exposure to organophosphates and carbamates.</p><p id="Par31">Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>) found that the mixture of CPF and F had a synergistic toxic effect on the AChE activity in common carp. The toxicity of CPF mixed with diazinon appeared to be greater than these chemicals additive toxicity (Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>; CDFG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999b</xref>). A recent study by Zhao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>) on <italic>Danio rerio</italic> showed that the toxicity of F mixed with CPF and fipronil was synergistic. Mehler et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>) found that CPF and atrazine had synergistic effects on <italic>Pimephales promelas</italic> and <italic>Chironomus tentans</italic>, while there was no significant difference in the effect on <italic>Lepomis macrochirus</italic> compared to the effect from CPF alone. Several studies on the joint toxicity of CPF and atrazine indicate a synergistic effect on several aquatic species (Pape-Lindstrom and Lydy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1997</xref>; Belden and Lydy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Anderson and Lydy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>; Jin-Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>; Lydy and Linck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>; Schuler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>). However, Wacksman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>) found no synergistic effects, but a small antagonistic effect between atrazine and CPF on the toxicity to <italic>P. promelas</italic>.</p><p id="Par32">The reduced long-term effect from a mixture of CPF and F compared to only CPF, found in this study, could be due to the different bindings of F and CPF to the AChE enzyme. Although both CPF and F inhibit the AChE enzyme, their modes of actions are different. CPF tend to bind stronger to the enzyme because it contains a thiol group (P=S), while the binding to the enzyme of F is less strong and more reversible. Chambers and Carr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>) noted that phosphorylated AChE is much more stable than the carbamylated AChE and that the spontaneous reactivation is much slower for phosphorylated AChE.</p><p id="Par33">F can also bind directly to AChE enzyme, while CPF need to be activated before it can bind to AChE enzyme (Chambers and Carr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). When exposed to a mixture of CPF and F, the majority of the AChE enzymes may therefore initially be blocked by F, which was applied in a higher concentration than CPF, and is more water soluble than CPF. However, with time, the inhibition by F disappears (c.f Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), because of its reversible bindings. When this happens, the concentrations of both F and CPF in the water have probably decreased to a level where no significant amount of new bindings to the AChE enzyme can be established.</p><p id="Par34">Under field conditions, fish exposed to a mixture of F and CPF recovered even more quickly (c.f. Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which probably is because of a larger proportion of the applied CPF, as compared to F, binds to organic matter and the sediments because of CPF&#x02019;s higher K<sub>oc</sub> value, and thus cannot bind to the enzyme (Tam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">Thus, it is possible that a combination of F and CPF could have an additive toxic effect initially (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;day), but later shows a reduced effect, because of some kind of interference on each other&#x02019;s mode of action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">This study shows that the applications of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, such as CPF and F, impact negatively on native fish species, such as climbing perch. CPF was found to cause a significant and more prolonged inhibition on the brain AChE activity in climbing perch than F. The inhibition by the mixture of CPF and F was significantly higher than the inhibition by only F, but less prolonged and significant lower than the inhibition by only CPF over time.</p><p id="Par37">Still, CPF, F, and the mixture of CPF and F applied at concentrations similar to those applied by rice farmers in the Mekong Delta resulted in a significant reduction in the AChE activity in climbing perch. A recent study by Stadlinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>) shows that in the Mekong Delta, most OP and CM compounds are used in concentrations that are not likely to cause any acute toxic effects on aquatic organisms, but may still generate long-term lethal and sub-lethal effects. The results indicate that these effects could be one of the causes of the decline of wild fish populations in rice fields in the Mekong Delta (Anh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>), and efforts should be made to find safer ways to use pesticides in the Mekong Delta to avoid negative side effects on the environment and peoples&#x02019; health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Two anonymous reviewers provided valuable comments.</p></ack><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding information</title><p>Financial support was provided by the Ministry of Education and Training of Vietnam and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).</p></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><name><surname>Lydy</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Increased toxicity to invertebrates associated with a mixture of atrazine and organophosphate insecticides</article-title><source>Environ Toxicol Chem</source><year>2002</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>1507</fpage><lpage>1514</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/etc.5620210724</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12109753</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Anh VT, Chiem NN, Dung DT, Sultana P (2003) Vietnam PRA Report.
