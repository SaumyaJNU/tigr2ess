    "The combined effect of Vitashield 40EC (chlorpyrifos ethyl-CPF) and Bassa 50EC (fenobucarb-F) was compared with the effects from exposure to the two pesticides separately, by measuring the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in climbing perch fingerlings (Anabas testudineus). The experiment was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and included three treatments containing 0.173 mg/L of CPF, 1.137 mg/L of F, 0.173 mg/L of CPF + 1.137 mg/L of F (M), and a control. The inhibition of the brain AChE activity in fish exposed to F was weaker and shorter than in fish exposed to CPF. The inhibition by the mixture of CPF and F was significantly lower and less prolonged than the inhibition by only CPF but significantly higher than the inhibition by only F."
