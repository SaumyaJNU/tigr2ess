    "Brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens St√•l) is one of the most serious insect pests, which reduce rice yield remarkably in many rice-growing areas. A few plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria induce systemic resistance against herbivorous insects. Here we show that root drenching of rice seedlings with an endophytic strain Bacillus velezensis YC7010 enhanced defenses against BPH. Based on high-throughput transcriptome analysis, systemic resistance against BPH was induced by B. velezensis YC7010 via salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent pathways. Increased leaf contents of secondary metabolites, tricin and C-glycosyl flavone and cell-wall contents of lignin and cellulose were the key defense mechanisms inducing resistance against BPH during the three-way interaction. This study shows for the first time that chemical changes and strengthening of physical barriers play important roles simultaneously in plant defense against BPH in rice by the endophytic bacteria. This defense was induced by lipopeptides including a novel bacillopeptin X."
