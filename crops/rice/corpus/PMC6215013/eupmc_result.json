    "DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) modifications expand the information capacity of DNA and have long been known to exist in bacterial genomes. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzicola (Xoc) is the causative agent of bacterial leaf streak, an emerging and destructive disease in rice worldwide. However, the genome-wide distribution patterns and potential functions of 6mA in Xoc are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the levels and global distribution patterns of 6mA modification in genomic DNA of seven Xoc strains (BLS256, BLS279, CFBP2286, CFBP7331, CFBP7341, L8 and RS105). The 6mA modification was found to be widely distributed across the seven Xoc genomes, accounting for percent of 3.80, 3.10, 3.70, 4.20, 3.40, 2.10, and 3.10 of the total adenines in BLS256, BLS279, CFBP2286, CFBP7331, CFBP7341, L8, and RS105, respectively. Notably, more than 82% of 6mA sites were located within gene bodies in all seven strains. Two specific motifs for 6 mA modification, ARGT and AVCG, were prevalent in all seven strains. Comparison of putative DNA methylation motifs from the seven strains reveals that Xoc have a specific DNA methylation system. Furthermore, the 6 mA modification of rpfC dramatically decreased during Xoc infection indicates the important role for Xoc adaption to environment."
