To identify host factors that promote flavivirus replication, we performed a genome-wide gain-of-function cDNA screen for human genes that enhance the replication of flavivirus reporter particles in human cells. The screen recovered seventeen potential host proteins that promote viral replication, including the previously known dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase non-catalytic subunit (DDOST). Using silencing approaches, we validated the role of four candidates in YFV and WNV replication: ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), DDOST and importin 9 (IPO9). Applying a panel of virological, biochemical and microscopic methods, we validated further the role of RPL19 and DDOST as host factors required for optimal replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV. The genome-wide gain-of-function screen is thus a valid approach to advance our understanding of flavivirus replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Flavivirus</kwd><kwd>West Nile virus</kwd><kwd>Yellow fever virus</kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>Host-pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd>Virus replication</kwd><kwd>Genome-wide gain-of-function screen</kwd><kwd>Oligosaccharyltransferase complex</kwd><kwd>Ribosomal proteins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-viruses-11-00068"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Flaviviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to vertebrate hosts by mosquito or tick bites. Several members of the flavivirus genus, such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are highly pathogenic to humans and constitute major global health problems. Despite differences in cell tropism and pathogenesis, flaviviruses share common genomic organization, replication strategies and virion structure. Their genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule of around 10.7 kb, encoding a polyprotein precursor that give rise to seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) and three structural proteins (capsid C, membrane precursor prM and envelope E) upon processing by the viral protease NS3 and its cofactor NS2B, as well as by cellular proteases [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The structural proteins constitute the viral particle, while NS proteins coordinate RNA replication, viral assembly and modulate innate immune responses. To promote their replication, flaviviruses rearrange membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into novel organelle-like structures (also termed viral factories) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>YFV, which is the prototypic flavivirus, is responsible for viral hemorrhagic fever resulting in up to 50% fatality [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus circulates in tropical Africa and South America. The YFV vaccine 17 D is one of the most successful ever developed [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, due to poor vaccine coverage and vaccine shortage, YFV regularly resurges in the African and South American continents, as illustrated by recent outbreaks, and is now emerging in Asia [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. WNV is endemic throughout Africa, the Middle East, parts of Asia, and Europe. Since an outbreak in the USA in 1999, WNV has emerged as the most common cause of arboviral encephalitis in North and Middle America, causing millions of infections [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ZIKV has recently emerged in the South Pacific, South and Central Americas. Although many cases of ZIKV are asymptomatic and the most common symptoms of infection are rash, fever, and joint pain, the recent outbreaks caused alarm because they were associated with severe fetal abnormalities, including stillbirth and microcephaly, or the Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in infected adults [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ZIKV infection is now identified as a sexually-transmitted illness as well [<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DENV, by affecting an estimated 50&#x02013;100 million people per year is the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arboviral disease in humans [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with flavivirus infections, antiviral therapies are missing. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between flaviviruses and their cell host.</p><p>To carry out their replicative cycle, flaviviruses rely on hundreds of host gene products. Several genome-scale approaches, based on gene silencing techniques, such as siRNA-based screens [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and more recently, CRISPR/Cas9-based screens [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been used to identify flavivirus host factors. Here, we describe a lentiviral-based gain-of-function cDNA screening method to identify candidate host factors involved in flavivirus replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-00068"><title>2.

The GFP-puromycin fusion cassette was generated using the Puromycin coding sequence from pQCXIP vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA) as a template, using forward 5&#x02032;-GCCCTAGATCTATGACCGAGTACAAGCCCAC-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-GCCCTGGATCCTCAGGCACCGGGCTTGCGGGTCATGCACCA-3&#x02032; primers. The PCR product was then ligated into the BglII/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA). The resulting GFP-puromycin fusion construct was amplified by PCR using forward 5&#x02032;-GCCCTACGCGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-GCCCTACGCGTGGCACCGGGCTTGC-3&#x02032; primers and ligated into the MluI site of pWNVIIRep. The codon-optimized sequence the YFV structural genes was synthesized and cloned in pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RVPs were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with pWNVIIRep-G/Puro and pcDNA3.1(+)-YFV CprME vectors at a molar ratio of 1:1 by the calcium phosphate method. One to two hours prior transfection, the cells&#x02019; medium was changed with low-glucose DMEM medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. Plasmid DNA was mixed with H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then an equal volume of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.1, 140 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 50 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the mixture drop-wise with simultaneous vortexing. The final concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the transfection mix was 0.25 M. The resulting transfection mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then added to the cells. After overnight incubation, the medium of the transfected cells was replaced with fresh low-glucose medium. RVPs were harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection. The culture medium containing RVPs was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C to remove cell debris, filtered through 0.45 &#x003bc;m sterile PVDF filter and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>RVPs&#x02019; infectious titer was determined by infecting Huh7 cells for 48 h. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA)-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 10 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. The RVPs titer (IU/mL, infectious units/mL) was calculated using the formula [(F &#x000d7; C)/V] &#x000d7; D, where F equals the frequency of GFP-positive cells (percentage obtained divided by 100), C equals the total number of cells in the well at the start of infection, V equals the volume of inoculum and D is the RVPs dilution [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-viruses-11-00068"><title>2.4. cDNA Library Screen</title><p>A pooled, uncut, three-reading frame cDNA library of human A549 cells was prepared and cloned into pLenti6/DEST vector (custom-made services, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Selection of RVPs-infected cells with puromycin (2 &#x003bc;g/mL) was started 48 h after infection. After selection with puromycin for three weeks, the resistant colonies (77 in total) were pooled. An aliquot (~ 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells) was taken for genomic DNA extraction, which was done by lysing the cells in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS and 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K for 12 h at 50 &#x000b0;C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.

Reactions with genomic DNA from HT1080 parental cells and HT1080 cells transduced with pLenti6-GFP were performed in parallel as negative and positive controls, respectively. NGS of PCR products from the pool of 77 clones was done at Institut Pasteur&#x02019;s &#x02018;Plateforme Transcriptome et Epigenome (PF2)&#x02019; using Illumina MiSEQ instrument. Amplification-free DNA library was prepared using NEXTflex&#x000ae; PCR-Free DNA Library Prep Kit (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA). The sequencing run was paired-end with a read length of 162 base pairs. Reads were mapped to the human reference genome USCS hg19 using STAR [<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with parameters adjusted to detect the junction between the lentiviral vector and the cDNA clone, thus restricting the analysis to amplicons derived from the transduced vector and excluding hits derived from possible genomic DNA contaminants. Hits with more than 10 mapped reads were considered candidate genes.

Identification of Host Factors That Promote the Replication of Chimeric YFV/WNV Reporter Particles</title><p>To identify host factors that positively regulate flavivirus replication, we designed a strategy to screen a lentiviral cDNA library in cells in which viral replication was inefficient. We first tested the efficiency of infection of YFV, the prototypical flavivirus, in various mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that four to five times more A549, Huh7, HeLa, HEK293T and BHK-21 cells were positive for YFV E protein than HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells at 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). WNV and ZIKV replication was also less efficient in HT1080 cells than in A549 cells at 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). A549 cells were chosen to produce the cDNA library, which was cloned into a lentiviral vector carrying a blasticidin resistance gene. To screen the library, we applied a selection method based on the use of reporter virus particles (RVPs). RVPs are pseudo-viruses that can be generated by complementation of a subgenomic replicon (encoding NS flavivirus proteins and a reporter/selection cassette) by a plasmid encoding the structural proteins (C, prM, E) provided <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The RVPs-infected cells replicate the subgenomic replicon at a level that depends on the presence of host replication factors, and such cells can be selected with antibiotics. We were unable to generate YFV RVPs, possibly because YFV structural genes expressed <italic>in trans</italic> did not package YFV subgenomic replicon. We have previously produced RVPs carrying YFV structural proteins with the WNV replication machinery [<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and thus used these chimeric RVPs to perform the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Since YFP and WNV replicated less efficiently in HT1080 cells than in other cells tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B), they provided suitable target cells to screen the cDNA library for genes encoding proteins enhancing viral replication. HT1080 cells were transduced with the cDNA library and selected based on antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Selected cells were then challenged with YFV-enveloped WNV RVPs expressing GFP and a puromycin-resistance gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Seventy-seven colonies survived the antibiotic treatment. They were pooled and an aliquot was taken for genomic DNA extraction. PCR products obtained using primers aligning to the LTR of the lentiviral vector were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Mapping of the reads onto the human genome was done with parameters adjusted to detect the junction between the lentiviral vector and the cDNA clone, thus restricting the analysis to library cDNAs and excluding hits derived from possible genomic DNA contaminants. Seventeen genes with more than ten reads were identified using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). These genes were classified into distinct categories according to subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>F). For further investigation, we focused on the six most enriched (&#x0003e; 100 reads) non-mitochondrial genes identified: The two ribosomal proteins RPS3 and RPL19, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4), GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2 (GIGYF2), dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase non-catalytic subunit (DDOST) and importin 9 (IPO9). DDOST is a part of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) machinery that catalyzes the N-linked glycolysation of newly-synthetized proteins in the ER [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Members of the OST complex, including DDOST, have been recently identified as flavivirus host-factors by different approaches, such as genome-scale CRISPR screens [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and proteomic analysis of cellular factors that interact with DENV NS1 [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, recovery of DDOST in our cDNA screen validates our strategy to identify genes promoting flavivirus replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-11-00068"><title>3.2. Gene Silencing Approaches Validate the Role of Identified Candidates in YFV and WNV Replication</title><p>To validate the role of the six selected candidates in the context of genuine flavivirus infection, we conducted siRNA-mediated gene silencing experiments in HeLa cells, which are permissive to YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and WNV [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As a positive control, we used siRNA directed against ATP6V1B2, a protein required for fusion between flaviviral and endosomal membranes [<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Non-targeting siRNA were used as negative controls. RT-qPCR analyses confirmed that the pools of siRNA were reducing the expression of their respective targets (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S1</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis performed at 24 h post-infection revealed that silencing of RPL19, RPS3 and DDOST significantly impaired both YFV and WNV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Reduced expression of IPO9 significantly impaired replication of WNV, but not of YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The number of cells positive for the viral protein E in cells depleted of GIGYF2 or TIMP4 was either similar or higher compared to that of control cells upon YFV or WNV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B), suggesting that these two candidates are dispensable for replication of both viruses. This does not exclude the possibility that their over-expression enhanced viral replication and thus explains their recovery through the screen.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that RPL19, RPS3 and DDOST are genuine YFV and WNV host dependency factors. To demonstrate further the usefulness of our screening approach, we focused on two of the main hit genes, DDOST and RPL19.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-11-00068"><title>3.3. DDOST Is a Flavivirus Host Factor</title><p>We investigated the function of DDOST in flavivirus replication. siRNA-mediated silencing of DDOST in infected HeLa cells followed by RT-qPCR analysis revealed that DDOST expression was required for optimal YFV and WNV RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). These data are in agreement with our previous flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). DDOST expression was also required for optimal ZIKV RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction of release of infectious YFV, WNV and ZIKV particles in the supernatant of cells that expressed a lower level of DDOST compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). To investigate the localization of DDOST in HeLa cells infected with the three tested viruses, immunofluorescence microscopy on cells transiently expressing DDOST-GFP was performed. In non-infected cells, DDOST-GFP was distributed in an intracellular reticular pattern consistent with ER localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In cells infected with YFV, WNV or ZIKV, DDOST-GFP was recruited to sites of viral replication, which were identified by the presence of NS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>C).</p><p>Given the debate on the potential role of the OST complex for flavivirus proteins N-glycosylation [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we performed immunoblot analysis for YFV-, WNV- and ZIKV-NS1, as well as for YFV-NS4B in HeLa cells silenced for DDOST. NS1 is highly conserved among flaviviruses and contains two N-glycosylation sites [<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] that are important for RNA replication and pathogenesis. DENV NS4B is N-glycosylated in infected cells and NS4B of related flaviviruses are likely to be glycosylated too, since they contain two to three putative N-glycosylation sites [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the host dependency factor ATP6V1B2 [<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] served as positive controls in these experiments. In YFV infected cells, antibodies against NS1 revealed the presence of NS1, but also of a polyprotein precursor consisting of NS1 and a portion of NS2A, previously called NS1-2A* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), [<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In control HeLa cells, the vast majority of NS1 and NS1-2A* were detected as unique species, probably representing the fully glycosylated forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). A faint NS1 band with faster mobility than the main NS1 species was sometimes observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). This band likely represents a de-glycosylated form of NS1. In cells silenced for DDOST, expression of both the fully glycosylated forms of NS1 and NS1-2A* were reduced compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p><p>Moreover, the lower NS1 species was more apparent in cells silenced for DDOST than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Two lower NS1-2A* species were also observed in cells silenced for DDOST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Expression of YFV-NS4B was reduced in cells silenced for DDOST compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), but no lower band was observed. The effect of DDOST silencing on WNV and ZIKV NS1 proteins was similar to the one observed on YFV-NS4B, i.e., a reduced level of expression but no appearance of faster mobility band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). These data suggest that DDOST may be involved in YFV-NS1 glycosylation but not in YFV-NS4B, WNV-NS1 or ZIKV-NS1 glycosylation. Reduced expression of YFV-NS4B, WNV-NS1, and ZIKV-NS1 in cells silenced for DDOST could be caused by an indirect effect of DDOST silencing on viral replication or by a direct effect on viral protein stability. Together, these data show that DDOST is recruited to flavivirus replication sites and is required for efficient replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-11-00068"><title>3.4. RPL19 Is a Flavivirus Host Factor</title><p>To identify the viral replication step that depends on RPL19 expression, we assessed the replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV through viral E protein synthesis by flow cytometry in HeLa cells silenced for RPL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). siRNA oligonucleotides directed against the host dependency factor ATP6V1B2 were used as positive controls [<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In agreement with our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B), knockdown of RPL19 significantly impaired viral E protein synthesis upon YFV and WNV infections, as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The effect of RPL19 silencing on viral E protein synthesis was less pronounced upon ZIKV infection than upon YFV or WNV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Importantly, knockdown of RPL19 did not affect HeLa cells viability (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S2A</xref>), confirming that the effect of RPL19 silencing on YFV and WNV replication was not caused by reduced cell proliferation. We then assessed viral RNA production by RT-qPCR in HeLa cells silenced or not for RPL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). RPL19 silencing reduced YFV and WNV RNA production around two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). By contrast, ZIKV RNA yield was not affected by RPL19 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that YFV, WNV and ZIKV differ in their dependency on RPL19 for replication. We next examined NS4B and NS1 accumulation in RPL19-depleted cells infected with YFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Quantitative Western blot analysis revealed a reduction of around 80% of NS4B and NS1 expression in cells depleted of RPL19, compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). A similar reduction of WNV NS1 (around 90%) was observed upon RPL19 depletion in WNV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). RPL19 expression was also required for optimal YFV E production in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>E), without affecting their viability (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S2B</xref>). Together, these data show that RPL19 depletion had a stronger effect on viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C&#x02013;E) than on viral RNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that RPL19 is primarily required for efficient YFV and WNV protein production. One can envisage that a primary effect on NS protein production triggers a secondary effect on the level of viral RNA synthesis. RT-qPCR analysis performed on cells silenced for RPL19 expression and infected for six hours with YFV showed that reduced expression of RPL19 had no significant effect on early step of viral replication (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S3</xref>), supporting an effect of RPL19 on viral translation rather than viral RNA production or viral entry.</p><p>To validate further the role of RPL19 in viral replication, stable HT1080 cell lines over-expressing RPL19 were generated. HT1080 cell lines over-expressing DDOST were used as a positive control. HT1080 cells over-expressing TIM-1, a protein known to enhance YFV entry into mammalian cell [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as HT1080 cells over-expressing RPS3, were also included in the analysis. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that transduced cells expressed more RPL19, RPS3, DDOST and TIM-1 than control cells transduced with an empty vector (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S4A</xref>). To analyze the effect of over-expressing these proteins in an experimental set-up that resembles the one used during the cDNA library screening, cells were challenged with the YFV/WNV chimeric RVPs expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S4B</xref>). Of note, the over-expression of the cDNAs used during the screen was driven by a CMV promoter whereas these experiments were conducted with a lentiviral vector containing an LTR promoter. RVPs make only a single round of infection [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Fluorescence intensity of GFP positive cells was measured to assess viral replication. As expected from our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f003">Figure 3</xref>), cells over-expressing DDOST produced about four- to five-fold more GFP than control cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S4B</xref>). Cells over-expressing RPL19 and RPS3 produced about two-fold more GFP than control cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S4B</xref>), albeit this increase was not statistically significant. As expected for a viral entry factor, TIM-1 over-expression did not enhance viral replication in a given infected cell (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S4B</xref>). These data suggest that over-expressing RPL19 or RPS3 favors the replication of the WNV-GFP replicon and probably not a viral entry step.</p><p>To determine whether ribosomal proteins other than RPL19 and RPS3 are necessary for YFV replication, we silenced RPS25 and RACK1, two components of the 40S subunit of the ribosome that were recently identified as host factors for DENV [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In agreement with our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), knockdown of RPL19 and RPS3 caused a significant reduction in the percentage of cells positive for the viral E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). Similarly, knockdown of RPS25 impaired YFV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). By contrast, production of YFV E protein was not affected by RACK1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00068-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). RT-qPCR analysis showed that gene knockdown with two independent siRNAs or with a siRNA pool resulted in around 80% reduction of expression of each target genes in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S5A</xref>). Cell viability was not affected by silencing these four proteins individually (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00068">Figure S5B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that YFV replication is dependent on a subset of ribosomal proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-viruses-11-00068"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>All the large-scale genetic perturbation screens that have been performed so far in the context of flaviviral infection consisted of loss-of-function screens based on either siRNA or CRISPR approaches [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Limitations of these loss-of-function screens include lack of sensitivity due to incomplete knockdown efficiency, false-negative results because of certain siRNA or gRNAs lacking activity and false-positive candidate genes due to potential off-target effects. We performed a genome-wide gain-of-function screen by over-expressing into HT1080 cells a library of cDNA generated from A459 cells. This approach, based on the generation of RVPs expressing antibiotic selection cassettes, can be adapted to any flavivirus. Our screen allowed the recovery of 17 potential flavivirus host dependency factors, including the previously known factor DDOST. The role of four candidates in YFV and WNV replication (RPL19, RPS3, DDOST and IPO9) was validated using siRNA-silencing assays, demonstrating the utility and relevance of our lentiviral overexpression screening strategy. However, as with any other genetic screens, our approach has its limitations, including the identification of false positive genes. GIGYF2 may be one of them since its reduced expression did not perturb WNV replication. GIGYF2 could have been selected in the screen because its integration in the genome of HT1080 cells disrupted the expression of a gene with antiviral properties. False positive genes may also arise during amplification by PCR of genomic DNA that was not the result of lentiviral integrative events. To limit this, we discarded non-integrated genes from the analysis. Another caveat of genome-wide gain-of-function screens is the potential loss of ORFs during the generation of the cDNA library, especially long ones. In sum, exploiting both gain- and loss-of-function screening strategies in the context of flavivirus infection should provide complementary information.</p><p>Two of our main hits were the ribosomal proteins RPL19 and RPS3. The screen also recovered EEF1A1, a ribosome associated translation elongation factor. We showed that RPL19 is required for efficient YFV and WNV protein production. ZIKV seemed less dependent on RPL19 than YFV and WNV for efficient replication. Other ribosomal proteins, such as RPS25, RPL18, RPL7, RPL1 and RPLP2 were previously recovered in genome-wide loss-of-function screens performed in the context of DENV, YFV and WNV infections [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, several ribosomal proteins, including RPS3 and RPL19, were identified as DENV NS1 binding partners using affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays, both in cells over-expressing NS1 [<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or replicating a DENV replicon [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Among the dozen ribosomal proteins identified as DENV NS1 partners, RPL18 and RPS25 were chosen for further investigations and shown to be required for DENV protein translation [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, knockdown of the ribosomal proteins RPLP1/2 strongly reduced DENV protein accumulation, suggesting a requirement for RPLP1/2 in viral protein translation [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These data, together with ours, suggest that flaviviruses depend on a subset of ribosomal proteins for efficient replication. One can wonder why, among the 80 ribosomal proteins that exist, only a small subset was recovered in our screen and others [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RPL19 and RPS3 may have been the most abundant ribosomal proteins in the cDNA library that we generated. Alternatively, as suggested [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], viral NS proteins may recruit and/or anchor ribosomes to the ER via direct (or indirect) interaction with a subset of ribosomal proteins, including RPL19 and RPS3. Finally, one could also envisage that RPL19 and RPS3 have pro-viral functions that are not linked to their ribosomal activities [<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Indeed, RPL19 has been proposed to inhibit IRF3 activation in HEK293 cells over-expressing TLR3 [<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, despite our efforts, we were unable to establish a link between RPL19 expression and antiviral IRF3-mediated interferon signaling.</p><p>DDOST was among the top-ranked hits of our screen. The human OST complex, which catalyzes the transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide to selected asparagine residues of polypeptide chains, consists of seven subunits: Ribophorin I (RPN1), ribophorin II (RPN2), DDOST/OST48, DAD1, STT3 (isoform A or B), OST4 and N33/Tusc3 or IAP/MAGT1 [<xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results showed that DDOST is required for efficient replication of YFV, WNV and ZIKV in HeLa cells. This is in line with data showing that STT3A and OSTC expression is required for ZIKV, JEV, DENV and YFV replication in HEK293T cells [<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as with data showing the dependency of DENV, YFV, WNV and ZIKV replication on STT3B in HAP1 cells [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, surprisingly, replication of YFV and WNV was not dependent on STT3A or STT3B in Huh7.5.1 cells [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that different flaviviruses rely on different OST subunits for replication. The use of different cell types may also account for some of the discrepancies described for flavivirus OST-dependency. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy analysis have revealed co-localization of HA-tagged MAGT1 and STT3B with DENV replication compartments [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is in line with our experiments showing recruitment of DDOST-GFP at viral replication sites during YFV, WNV and ZIKV infection. Direct interactions between STT3A- and DENV-NS2B and -NS3 proteins have also been documented in the context of viral infection [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and between DDOST and ectopically expressed DENV-NS1, -NS3 and -NS4B [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Glycosylation of the flaviviral proteins M, E, NS1 and NS4B is key for viral replication and pathogenesis, as well as for viral dissemination in mammalian hosts and mosquito vectors [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Whether the OST complex favors flavivirus replication in a glycosylation-dependent or -independent manner is still a matter of debate. Since DENV replication is drastically inhibited in OST-silenced cells [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the assessment of viral protein expression and glycosylation were performed in cells exogenously expressing DENV NS1 and NS4B [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These experiments concluded that the OST complex participates in DENV NS1 and NS4B glycosylation. Our Western blot analysis, which were performed in cells infected with YFV, WNV and ZIKV and silenced for DDOST expression, suggest that DDOST could be involved, at least in part, in YFV-NS1 glycosylation, but not in YFV-NS4B, WNV-NS1 or ZIKV-NS1 glycosylation. However, reduced expression of YFV-NS4B, WNV-NS1, and ZIKV-NS1 in cells silenced for DDOST was observed, suggesting an effect of the OST machinery on the stability of these NS proteins. We propose that the OST complex acts on flavivirus replication by glycosylating a specific subset of viral proteins, such as YFV-NS1, but also by non-canonical functions that stabilize NS proteins, such as YFV-NS4B, WNV-NS1, and ZIKV-NS1. Glycosylation-independent activities of the OST complex may include structural scaffolding function [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the catalytic oxidoreductase activity of MAGT1 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and/or promotion of viral protein stability. Alternatively, the OST complex could also favor flavivirus replication via the glycosylation of a proviral cellular factor.</p><p>Four mitochondrial genes were identified during the screen (MT-CO3, MT-CYB, MT-RNR2 and MT-TT). It will be of interest to investigate further their potential role in flavivirus replication. A recent proteomic analysis identified a dozen mitochondrial proteins as partners of DENV replication complexes [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, DENV infection disrupts mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are ER-connected interfaces critical for innate immune signaling [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Manipulation of specific mitochondrial proteins or MAMs by flaviviruses may thus create a favorable replicative environment by protecting flaviviruses from innate immunity and/or by promoting cell survival.</p><p>Another main hit from the screen is TIMP4. However, silencing its expression had no effect on YFV and WNV replication in Hela cells, suggesting that it is dispensable for efficient replication of these two flaviviruses. TIMP4-mediated enhancement of viral replication maybe cell-type specific. Of note, TIMP4 was identified in a yeast-hybrid screen as a partner of the protein 2A of the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3, a positive-strand RNA virus unrelated to flaviviruses [<xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and may be involved in coxsackievirus pathogenesis [<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00068" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Finally, our data showed that IPO9, which functions mainly in nuclear protein import, was necessary for optimal WNV replication but not required for YFV replication. Its precise role in viral replication, as well as its specificity towards WNV remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-viruses-11-00068"><title>5.
