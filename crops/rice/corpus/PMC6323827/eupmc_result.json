    "BACKGROUND:Research on the submergence stress of rice has concentrated on the quiescence strategy to survive in long-term flooding conditions based on Submergence-1A (SUB1A). In the case of the ripening period, it is important that submergence stress can affect the quality as well as the survival of rice. Therefore, it is essential to understand the changes in the distribution of assimilation products in grain and ripening characteristics in submergence stress conditions. However, such studies have been insufficient at the physiological and molecular biological levels. RESULTS:We confirmed that the distribution rate of assimilation products in grain was decreased by submergence treatment. These results were caused by an increase in the distribution rate of assimilation products to the stem according to escape strategy. To understand this phenomenon at the molecular level, we analyzed the relative expression levels of genes related to sucrose metabolism, and found that the sucrose phosphate synthase gene (OsSPS), which induces the accumulation of sucrose in tissues, was decreased in the seeds and leaves, but not in the stems. Furthermore, the sucrose transporter gene (OsSUT) related to sucrose transport decreased in the seeds and leaves, but increased in stems. We also analyzed the biological metabolic processes related to starch and sucrose synthesis, carbon fixation, and glycolysis using the KEGG mapper with selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in seeds, stems, and leaves caused by submergence treatment. We found that the expression of genes for each step related to starch and D-glucose synthesis was down-regulated in the seeds and leaves but up-regulated in the stem. CONCLUSION:The results of this study provide basic data for the development of varieties and corresponding technologies adapted to submergence conditions, through understanding the action network of the elements that change in the submergence condition, as well as information regarding useful DEGs."
