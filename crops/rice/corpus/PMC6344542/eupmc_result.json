    "Dengue virus (DENV) caused millions of infections around the world annually. Co-infection with different serotypes of DENV is associated with dengue hemorrhagic shock syndrome, leading to an estimate of 50% death rate. No approved therapies are currently available for the treatment of DENV infection. Hence, novel anti-DENV agents are urgently needed for medical therapy. Here we demonstrated that a natural product (2 R,4 R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-yne (THHY), extracted from avocado (Persea americana) fruit, can inhibit DENV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner and efficiently suppresses replication of all DENV serotypes (1-4). We further reveal that the NF-κB-mediated interferon antiviral response contributes to the inhibitory effect of THHY on DENV replication. Using a DENV-infected ICR suckling mouse model, we found that THHY treatment caused an increased survival rate among mice infected with DENV. Collectively, these findings support THHY as a potential agent to control DENV infection."
