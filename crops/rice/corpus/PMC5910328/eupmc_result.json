    "Rice (Oryza sativa) is the main food for half of the world's population, and is considered the model for molecular biology studies of monocotyledon species. Although the rice genome was completely sequenced about 15Â years ago, the function of most rice genes is still unknown.In this study, we developed a vector toolkit that contains 42 vectors for transient expression studies in rice protoplasts and stable expression analysis in transgenic rice. These vectors have been successfully used to study protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, gene overexpression, and the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. A novel feature of these vectors is that they contain a universal multiple cloning site, which enables more than 99% of the rice coding sequences to be conveniently transferred between vectors.The versatile vectors represent a highly efficient and high-throughput toolkit for functional analysis of rice genes."
