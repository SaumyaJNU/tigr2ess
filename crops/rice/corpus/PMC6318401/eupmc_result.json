    "Fermented brown rice and rice bran with Aspergillus oryzae (FBRA) is known to possess potentials to prevent\nchemical carcinogenesis in multiple organs of rodents. In the present study, possible chemopreventive effect of FBRA\nagainst spontaneous occurrence of lymphomas was examined using female AKR/NSlc mice. Four-week-old female AKR/\nNSlc mice were divided into three groups, and fed diets containing FBRA for 26 weeks at a dose level 0% (Group 1), 5%\n(Group 2) or 10% (Group 3). At the termination of experiment, the incidence of thymic malignant lymphoma of Group\n3 was significantly lower than of Group 1 (p < 0.05). The average number of apoptotic cells of the thymic lymphoma of\nGroup 3 was significantly larger than that of Group 1 (p < 0.05). In addition, the incidences of malignant lymphoma\narising from body surface and abdominal lymph nodes, and the frequencies of lymphoma cell invasion to liver, kidney,\nspleen, and ovary of Group 3 were relatively lower than those of Group 1. These results indicate that FBRA inhibits\nspontaneous development of the lymphoma in female AKR/NSc mice and the inhibition of lymphomagenesis may\nrelate to the induction of apoptosis by exposure of FBRA, suggesting that FBRA could be a protective agent against\ndevelopment of human lymphoma."
