This forms an extended biotrophic interface enclosing an apoplastic compartment into which fungal effectors can be deployed to evade host detection. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> also forms a focal, plant membrane-rich structure, the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), that accumulates cytoplasmic effectors for translocation into host cells. Molecular decision-making processes integrating fungal growth and metabolism in host cells with interface function and dynamics are unknown. Here, we report unanticipated roles for the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Target-of-Rapamycin (TOR) nutrient-signaling pathway in mediating plant-fungal biotrophic interface membrane integrity. Through a forward genetics screen for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> mutant strains resistant to the specific TOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin, we discovered <italic>IMP1</italic> encoding a novel vacuolar protein required for membrane trafficking, V-ATPase assembly, organelle acidification and autophagy induction. During infection, &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> deletants developed intracellular IH in the first infected rice cell following cuticle penetration. However, fluorescently labeled effector probes revealed that interface membrane integrity became compromised as biotrophy progressed, abolishing the BIC and releasing apoplastic effectors into host cytoplasm. Growth between rice cells was restricted. TOR-independent autophagy activation in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> deletants (following infection) remediated interface function and cell-to-cell growth. Autophagy inhibition in wild type (following infection) recapitulated &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>. In addition to vacuoles, Imp1<sup>GFP</sup> localized to IH membranes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest TOR-Imp1-autophagy branch signaling mediates membrane homeostasis to prevent catastrophic erosion of the biotrophic interface, thus facilitating fungal growth in living rice cells. The significance of this work lays in elaborating a novel molecular mechanism of infection stressing the dominance of fungal metabolism and metabolic control in sustaining long-term plant-microbe interactions. This work also has implications for understanding the enigmatic biotrophy to necrotrophy transition.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Plant-associated fungi can form intimate connections with living host cells. Clarifying the molecular drivers of these interactions, and which partner is dominant, might be important in understanding how beneficial plant-fungal relationships can be enhanced to improve crop yields while pathogenic interactions that threaten crop health are disrupted.

Such interfaces comprise of a hyphal plasma membrane and cell wall, an interfacial matrix, and a plant-derived membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although intrinsic to many important crop diseases, nothing is known at the molecular level about how such plant-microbe interfacial zones are regulated and maintained as the fungus elaborates hyphae in and between host cells. The blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, cause of devastating rice and wheat losses [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], initially colonizes living rice cytoplasm as a symptomless biotroph [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Once penetration pegs emerging from specialized appressorial infection cells on the leaf surface have breached the rice cuticle into underlying epidermal cells, they expand into thin primary hyphae that elaborate branched, bulbous intracellular invasive hyphae (IH) enclosed in plant-derived extra-invasive hyphal membranes (EIHM). A neckband forms an apoplastic interfacial compartment where apoplastic effectors like Bas4 [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Slp1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] are deployed by the conventional fungal ER-Golgi secretion pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> also forms a focal plant-membrane rich structure outside IH called the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) which forms in each newly infected rice cell until the lifestyle switch to necrotrophy. The BIC accumulates cytoplasmic effectors like Pwl2, destined for translocation into host cells, via an unconventional secretory pathway involving exocyst and SNARE proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Biotrophic interfaces thus facilitate effector deployment for the avoidance or suppression of plant innate immunity, and the intimate association between fungal hyphae and host plant cell-derived membranes is critical to the success of the infection process.</p><p>In addition to effector secretion, the suppression of plant innate immunity requires robust fungal antioxidation systems to neutralize host reactive oxygen species (ROS) that otherwise trigger growth-restricting plant defense responses [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, correct BIC formation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> was found to be dependent on neutralizing the plant oxidative burst in a carbon- and nitrogen signaling-dependent manner via the fungal nitrooxidative stress response [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These results indicated both that antioxidation is a cardinal event during infection, and that plant defense suppression and fungal development are linked via the regulation of fungal metabolism. This previous study also illustrated how plant and fungal physiology are intimately connected and carefully balanced during <italic>in planta</italic> growth such that a mutation in the fungus (loss of the nitronate monooxygenase-encoding gene <italic>NMO2</italic> required for the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> nitrooxidative stress response) resulted in a response from the plant (ROS accumulation and the elicitation of host innate immunity) which affected the development of the fungus (multi-BIC formation and impaired growth).</p><p>We seek detailed insights on the metabolic regulation of fungal physiology during host infection with a long-term goal of understanding how fungal metabolism is connected to plant defense suppression. Recently, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Target-of-Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway has emerged as a key component of the rice infection process [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. TOR kinase function is conserved in eukaryotes and integrates nutritional cues with cell growth and development by controlling central metabolism, ribosome biosynthesis and protein translation in response to amino acids, glucose and energy [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In yeast, active TOR signaling directly represses autophagy by phosphorylation of the autophagy-related (Atg) protein Atg13. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, TOR signaling is inactivated, anabolic processes are repressed and autophagy is induced by the dephosphorylation of Atg13 resulting in the assembly of the Atg1 protein kinase complex and the induction of macroautophagy (autophagy) [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Atg13 is a direct target of the yeast TORC1 complex, although the Tap42-PPase branch of the TOR signaling pathway is also involved in autophagy induction [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> (which unlike yeast only carries one <italic>TOR</italic> gene and it is not known if TOR signaling in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> involves complexes equivalent to yeast TORC1 and TORC2), the inactivation of TOR signaling is required during spore germination on the nutrient-free leaf surface in order to elaborate a functional appressorium. TOR inactivation is mediated by the novel TOR regulator Abl1 and maintained by low levels of intracellular glucose [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and glutamine [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Inactive TOR engages two metabolic checkpoints at G2 and G1/G0 during spore germination in order to limit mitosis and induce autophagy and appressorium morphogenesis [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Conversely, once a mature appressorium has successfully penetrated into host cells, ATP production&#x02013;stimulated following a metabolic switch to glucose metabolism in response to glucose-6-phosphate/ NADPH sensing by Tps1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]&#x02014;activates TOR signaling, resulting in mitosis that facilitates early biotrophic growth [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The activity status of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> TOR signaling is critical to rice infection because activating TOR during spore germination results in multiple rounds of mitosis [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the loss of autophagy and appressorial development [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while preventing TOR activation following host penetration attenuates mitosis in IH and curtails biotrophic growth [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>By considering the importance of TOR signaling to both pre- and post-penetration infection stages, the motivation for this study was to identify and characterize additional TOR pathway components in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Using forward and reverse genetics, pharmacological treatments and confocal microscopy, we discovered and characterized <italic>IMP1</italic> encoding a vacuolar-localized protein that is required for vacuole function and membrane trafficking and also outlines IH during growth <italic>in planta</italic>. Imp1 acts downstream of TOR kinase and is required for autophagy induction in response to inactivated TOR signaling. Loss of the TOR-Imp1-autophagy signaling axis attenuated fungal growth in rice cells, abolished BIC formation and, as biotrophy progressed, resulted in the inappropriate release of apoplastic effectors into host cytoplasm, indicating that the ability to maintain biotrophic interface membrane integrity during sustained growth was compromised over time. We show this membrane defect was not due to the loss of vacuole function <italic>per se</italic>, nor due to early entry into necrotrophy, and propose it more likely results from impaired membrane trafficking and recycling through the fungal vesicular network. Imp1 thus unexpectedly connects metabolic signaling by TOR to autophagy-dependent membrane homeostasis, biotrophic interface maintenance and fungal growth in plant cells. Given that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>&#x02014;rice biotrophic interfaces are constructed from both fungal and plant membranes, the results presented here are surprising and significant in highlighting the importance of the metabolic status of the fungal cell to the longevity of the plant-microbe interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Random insertional mutagenesis using ATMT uncovers <italic>IMP1</italic> as a novel mediator of TOR-autophagy branch signaling</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Loss of <italic>IMP1</italic> function confers rapamycin resistance</title><p>The rationale for this study was that new information on drivers of fungal pathogenicity&#x02014;likely applicable to a range of important pathosystems&#x02014;might come from a better understanding of TOR signaling in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Employing a forward genetics approach, we uncovered <italic>IMP1</italic> as a previously unknown mediator of TOR-autophagy branch signaling essential for rice infection. <italic>IMP1</italic> was discovered in a genome-wide, unbiased manner by screening <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> mutant strains&#x02014;generated by random insertional mutagenesis employing <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-meditated transformation (ATMT)&#x02013;for resistance or insensitivity to the specific TOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibits TOR signaling and, like for yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], arrests <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> growth [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] on plate media (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007814.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>). Following ATMT, only six rapamycin resistant mutant strains (AT1 to AT6) were recovered to purity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007814.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>). In order to determine which mutant strain(s) to focus on, our initial assessments found that only the ATMT transformant designated AT2 produced spores (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007814.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>). This suggested that mutants carrying the genetic lesion resulting in AT2 would be amenable to downstream analyses of infection-related development and pathogenicity on rice hosts. AT1 and AT3-AT6 were thus not studied further.</p><p>To determine the nature of the genetic lesion in AT2 caused by ATMT and resulting in rapamycin resistance, we used TAIL PCR and the known <italic>hph</italic> and T-DNA sequences [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to liberate T-DNA flanks and adjacent <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome sequences.

To distinguish which scenario was most likely correct, we first determined the response of the &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> mutant strain to rapamycin in a growth-independent manner by studying the effects of rapamycin treatment on appressorium development.

Although Imp1 is required for autophagy induction and is involved in V-ATPase function and the fusion of autophagosomes and endosomes to vacuoles, pharmacological evidence situates the role of Imp1 in biotrophic interface maintenance and effector deployment upstream of V-ATPase activity and downstream of phagophore initiation. Also, because 1) the number of autophagosomes are decreased in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>; 2) endosomes can contribute membranes to phagosomes, and 3) because AM elevates early autophagy by increasing autophagosome number; we suggest that Imp1 acts by facilitating the contribution of endosomal membranes, originating at the plasma membrane, to phagophore expansion. Furthermore, 3-MA inhibition of autophagy induction prevented Imp1 localization on IH membranes, suggesting Imp1 might facilitate membrane recycling through the wider vesicular network or&#x02014;because ConA and BafA1 treatment did not prevent Imp1 localizing on IH membranes&#x02014;via a vacuole-independent route. Loss of Imp1 would reduce the efficiency of this membrane recycling process, leading to stochastic senescence of the biotrophic membrane over time. We thus propose that in response to autophagy initiation, Imp1 has two distinct roles: in vacuole function and late stage autophagy to optimize biotrophic growth, and in facilitating biotrophic interface longevity by mediating membrane sourcing during phagophore expansion and autophagosome formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1007814.g011"/></fig></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Discussion</title><p>TOR signaling status has recently emerged as an important factor governing rice infection by the blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>: inactive TOR signaling on the host surface is required for morphogenesis of the specialized appressorium infection cell [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; active TOR signaling following penetration into rice epidermal cells drives early biotrophic growth and the elaboration of IH [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

We propose that Imp1 facilitates phagophore expansion and autophagosome formation during autophagy induction by sourcing membranes from endosomes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007814.g011">Fig 11B</xref></bold>). The absence of this activity in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> affects membrane homeostasis and triggers biotrophic membrane integrity failure. Our reasoning is thus: Nonselective macroautophagy (autophagy) involves dynamic rearrangements of subcellular membranes [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Following autophagy induction and phagophore nucleation, the phagophore membrane expands to sequester cargo and generate autophagosomes [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Membrane vesicles from numerous endomembrane compartments including the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes contribute lipids for the expansion of phagophores [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Compared to the proteins involved in autophagy, little is known about the source of membranes involved in phagophore initiation and expansion [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], or the mechanisms involved in the transport of membrane vesicles from endomembrane compartments to the phagophore [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The plasma membrane, in addition to providing membranes for phagophore expansion, is also delivered by endocytic machinery to contribute to the pre-autophagosome structure/ phagophore assembly site (PAS), the immediate precursor of the phagophore [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Once formed from phagophores, autophagosomes fuse directly to vacuoles, releasing the inner autophagosome vesicle and cargo for degradation into the vacuole lumen, which becomes an autophagic body [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Four lines of evidence, when considered together, support our hypothesis that Imp1 is involved in the delivery of the plasma membrane, via endocytosis, for phagophore expansion during autophagy induction. First, blocking phagophore initiation with 3-MA in WT phenocopied &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>, resulting in the loss of membrane integrity, while inhibiting V-ATPase assembly, organelle acidification and vacuole function, which were also Imp1-dependent processes, affected IH growth but did not affect membrane integrity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007814.g011">Fig 11B</xref></bold>). This indicates that in order to maintain biotrophic membrane integrity during fungal growth in rice cells, Imp1 must act between phagophore initiation on one hand, and V-ATPase activity, vacuole function and late-stage autophagy on the other. Second, Imp1<sup>GFP</sup> is localized to both vacuoles and IH membranes, and components of early autophagosome precursors can also be found at the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Imp1 is lost from IH following 3-MA treatment. Third, Imp1 is not required for endocytosis. Fourth, the overlap between FM4-64 labeled vesicles and MDC-labeled compartments was almost abolished in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> hyphae compared to WT. Because MDC will stain vacuoles that have fused with autophagosomes, this could indicate that endosomes but not autophagosomes are defective in fusing to &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> vacuoles. However, in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>, not only was there less overlap between endosomes and autophagosomes, but the number of MDC-stained autophagic structures was also reduced compared to WT. How can we account for a mechanism that would both determine the degree of endosome and autophagosome overlap, and affect the number of autophagic vacuoles in hyphae? We hypothesize that endosomes might be contributing membranes to autophagosome formation in an Imp1-dependent manner. This would not likely occur by direct autophagosome-endosome fusion, because amphisomes are not formed by yeast [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but rather by the trafficking of plasma membrane vesicles to the expanding phagophore (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007814.g011">Fig 11B</xref></bold>). Reduced vesicle membrane trafficking in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> would result in both reduced overlap between labeled compartments, and an overall reduction in the number of autophagic structures.</p><p>In support of our claim that Imp1 mediates membrane vesicle trafficking to facilitate autophagosome production, we note that clathrin-mediated endocytosis regulates autophagosome formation in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Plasma membrane delivered in this manner are important for the massive increase in autophagosome biosynthesis required under inductive but not basal levels of autophagy [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Consequently, inhibition of endocytosis decreased autophagosome formation in this system by 30% [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. If Imp1 connects the plasma membrane with autophagosome formation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, this might similarly occur during increased autophagosome biosynthesis and could account for why Imp1 is required for inductive but not basal autophagy. We also note that different membrane sources contribute to autophagosome formation in response to different stimuli, for example mammalian mitochondrial membranes only contribute to autophagosome formation following starvation [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This might explain why Imp1 only localizes to plasma membranes in IH during <italic>in planta</italic> biotrophic growth, or in vegetative hyphae following rapamycin treatment.</p><p>When all evidence is considered together, it is conceivable that, during plant infection, as WT IH fill the first infected cell, nutrient becomes exhausted and TOR is inactivated, inducing autophagy and increasing demand for autophagosome production over basal levels. Plasma membranes and/ or recycling endosomes might then be recruited in an Imp1-dependent manner to contribute more membranes for phagophore expansion and autophagosome formation. Furthermore, in yeast, recycling endosomes can traffic internalized integral membrane proteins from the plasma membrane into different cellular pathways, including the vacuole for degradation, or direct their return to the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. If Imp1 directs similar membrane traffic in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> IH in order to balance plasma membrane recycling with the delivery of membranes to phagophores when autophagosome demand is high, then impaired delivery of membrane vesicles in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> would mean multiple cellular demands for membranes are not met. This would affect membrane homeostasis and might increasingly impact BIC and EIHM integrity as biotrophy progresses, resulting in the rapid and complete loss of BICs, and the erosion of the EIHM over time. In addition, plasma membrane recycling might bypass the vacuole [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], indicating why ConA and BafA1 treatments do not erode the interfacial membrane. Taken together, Imp1 might mediate endomembrane trafficking and membrane homeostasis to balance interfacial longevity with nutrient availability under the challenging growth conditions of the living rice cell (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007814.g011">Fig 11B</xref></bold>).</p><p>Although other processes could also be directly or indirectly affected by the loss of <italic>IMP1</italic> and account for the observed phenotypes, and while we acknowledge 1) that compared to yeast we are limited in our tools for analyzing membrane trafficking events and autophagic processes in filamentous fungi, especially during growth <italic>in planta</italic>, and 2) that the membrane origins of autophagy are still poorly resolved in any system [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], our hypothesis regarding the role of Imp1 in membrane trafficking and interface longevity provides a framework for interpreting the role of TOR signaling and autophagy in maintaining membrane integrity in intracellular symbionts.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>TOR signaling and Imp1 activity</title><p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> TOR signaling is dynamic during host cell growth, being active during the very early stages of biotrophy but inactive during later growth in the first infected cell in order to maintain membrane integrity and promote cell-to-cell movement. How and whether TOR activity status controls Imp1 function in response to changing stimuli in order to propagate the autophagy induction signal and mediate autophagosome production when necessary is not known. However, we could find no evidence from immunoblot analyses of changes in Imp1 processing following growth in TOR activating (glucose) versus inactivating (rapamycin) conditions, or as biotrophy progressed. Furthermore, Imp1 posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation were not evident across conditions. Thus, Imp1 might not be a direct or indirect target of TOR signaling. Also, it is not yet clear how Imp1 functions to mediate the autophagy response. Clues to answering these questions about Imp1 regulation and function might come from the knowledge that AM treatment, which affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, remediates &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>, suggesting Imp1 might play a role in modulating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in order to facilitate vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion in response to TOR-dependent autophagy induction. If so, Imp1 might be a structural&#x02014;rather than regulatory&#x02014;component of the TOR-autophagy signaling pathway that is recruited to facilitate early autophagy but is not rendered active by TOR. Thus, our current favored hypothesis is that Imp1 is a structural component of the TOR-autophagy signaling branch and is not subjected to direct TOR regulation. To test this hypothesis, future work might explore the connection between Imp1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> metabolism, attempt to confirm whether and how TOR (directly or indirectly) regulates Imp1 function, establish if the predicted N- and C-terminal domains of Imp1 are involved in responses to TOR, and ascertain whether Imp1 senses nutrient cues independently of TOR.</p><p>Stimulating autophagy with AM promoted cell-to-cell movement of WT and &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> by increasing the number of individual hyphae that moved to adjacent cells, indicating autophagy promotes sustained biotrophic colonization.

Because TOR can engage the cAMP/PKA/Pmk1 signaling pathway upstream of Pmk1 during appressorium formation [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it will be interesting to determine the nature of the relationship between TOR, autophagy and Pmk1 during growth in rice cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Insights on the biotrophy to necrotrophy transition</title><p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is a hemibiotroph characterized by the transition into necrotrophy after 3&#x02013;5 days of biotrophic growth in living rice cells [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Initially, it seemed plausible that the poor biotrophic growth of &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> resulted in an early transition to necrotrophy and the subsequent loss of biotrophic membrane integrity. If so, the loss of virulence would be the proximal cause of interface erosion. However, three lines of evidence suggested this is not the case and instead supported the fact that impaired biotrophic growth does not implicitly lead to early necrotrophy and the loss of biotrophic interface integrity. Firstly, AM treatment of &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> reconstituted the EIHM and BIC, along with stimulating biotrophic growth. This would not be possible if &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> had transitioned into necrotrophy, which would likely be irreversible. Secondly, WT treatment with ConA and BafA1 inhibited biotrophic growth but did not result in interface loss. Thirdly, a previous, unrelated study showed how biotrophic growth of the &#x00394;<italic>nmo2</italic> mutant was attenuated in the first infected cell, but Bas4<sup>GFP</sup> outlined &#x00394;<italic>nmo2</italic> IH and the BIC was visible, albeit fragmented, and still secreting Pwl2<sup>mCherry:NLS</sup> into rice cells [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We conclude that the loss of biotrophic interfacial membrane integrity is not necessarily a function of the loss of biotrophic growth and, moreover, attenuated biotrophic growth does not lead to early entry into necrotrophy. Rather, biotrophic membrane integrity is dependent upon TOR-autophagy signaling status, and biotrophic growth is attenuated in a reversible manner when the biotrophic interface erodes. Because biotrophic interface erosion must eventually occur during necrotrophy, we propose that autophagy-related processes regulated by TOR are likely involved in the biotrophy-necrotrophy lifestyle transition.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>The control of biotrophic membrane integrity and effector secretion</title><p>Fungal phytopathogens suppress host innate immunity by deploying cytoplasmic and apoplastic effectors, resulting in colonization and devastating crop losses. Preventing effector secretion into host cells would impair colonization, yet molecular pathways controlling effector secretion are unknown. Here, we showed how the TOR-Imp1-autophagy signaling axis ensures correct effector deployment by coordinating biotrophic interface maintenance with fungal growth in rice cells. Elaborating this relationship improves our understanding of the requirements for effector secretion and, because Pwl2<sup>mCherry:NLS</sup> is not observed in &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic> IH or the nuclei of &#x00394;<italic>imp1</italic>-infected rice cells after initial infection, our results hint at how effector secretion might be regulated <italic>in planta</italic>. Such knowledge might be leveraged in the future towards uncovering novel sources of plant disease resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Conclusions and significance</title><p>Our work uncovered two new insights with broad applicability to other systems: we discovered a new TOR signaling component, Imp1, and we revealed how fungal TOR signaling, via autophagy, dictates the longevity of the biotrophic interface between fungus and plant. In addition to vacuole functions, we conclude that Imp1 has a structural role in TOR-dependent autophagy induction by facilitating phagophore expansion.</p><p>Molecular mechanisms that regulate or maintain biotrophic interfaces and plant-fungal interfacial zones as fungi grow in plant cells are unknown and in general, genes known to be required for biotrophy are sparse. By providing the first evidence to suggest that TOR control of fungal autophagy is required for maintaining BIC and EIHM integrity during biotrophy, we reveal new molecular targets in the quest to manipulate plant-microbe interactions and improve crop productivity. We also highlight how the metabolic status of the fungal cell drives and dominates this interkingdom interface. Our results might also guide studies to understand the molecular regulators of the biotrophic to necrotrophic transition, a process likely widespread even amongst those fungal pathogens that are predominantly necrotrophic.</p><p>During a eukaryote-prokaryote interaction between <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, autophagy-derived membranes maintain host cell plasma membrane integrity and promote cell-to-cell transmission of the pathogen [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].

The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and equal volumes of total proteins in lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. Phosphorylation status of S6K1/Sch9 was monitored using anti-p-p70 S6 kinase &#x003b1; mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and normalized to &#x003b1;-tubulin. Western blots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-Mouse IgG) (Sigma) for p-p70 S6 kinase &#x003b1; and goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for tubulin &#x003b1;. Low temperatures (4&#x000b0;C), protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors were applied throughout the western blot analysis, including protein transfer and antibody binding. The blots were imaged using Clarity Western ECL chemiluminescent system (Bio-Rad) and quantitated by densitometry using ImageJ analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.net/Welcome">imagej.net/Welcome</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec043"><title>V-ATPase activity assays</title><p>Vesicle membranes were extracted from the protoplasts following the protocol of Chanda and colleagues [<xref rid="pgen.1007814.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

Absorbance change at 340 nm was immediately observed by a spectrophotometer. V-ATPase-independent ATPase activity was determined by the decrease in absorbance due to the addition of 100&#x02013;300 nM of the specific V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (ConA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Absorbance readings were linear up to an A340 value of 3.0. The molar extinction coefficient for NADH (e) is 6.22 mM<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup> and depletion of NADH was directly correlated to ATP hydrolysis. Specific activity corresponds to micromoles ATP hydrolyzed per minute per milligram protein.</p><p>For the proton pumping assay, approx. 200 &#x003bc;g of separated vacuolar vesicle proteins and 20 &#x003bc;M acridine orange (AO) were added to the assay solution.
