P. Beauv.), the second most cultivated millet species, is well adapted to diverse environments and remains an important cereal food and forage crop in arid and semiarid regions worldwide. A symbolic crop for indigenous Austronesian peoples, foxtail millet has been cultivated in Taiwan for more than 5,000 years, and landraces reflect diversifying selection for various food applications. A total of 124 accessions collected within Taiwan were assessed for <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes. Four identified <italic>Wx</italic> alleles, I, III, IV, and IX were caused by insertion of various transposable elements (TEs) and resulted in endosperm with non-waxy, low amylose content (AC), and waxy, respectively. A total of 16.9%, 4.0%, 49.2%, and 29.8% of accessions were classified as type I, III, IV, and IX, respectively; approximately half of the accessions belonged to the waxy type, indicating that glutinous grains were favored for making traditional food and wine. The TE insertion affected splicing efficiency rather than accuracy, leading to significantly reduced expression of <italic>wx</italic> in types III, IV, and IX, although their transcripts were the same as wild-type, type I. Consequently, the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) contents of the three mutated genotypes were relatively low, leading to waxy or low AC endosperm, and the <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes could explain 78% of variance in AC. The geographic distribution of <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes are associated with culinary preferences and migration routes of Taiwanese indigenous peoples&#x02014;in particular, the genotype of landraces collected from Orchid Island was distinct from those from Taiwan Island. This information on the major gene regulating starch biosynthesis in foxtail millet endosperm can be applied to breeding programs for grain quality, and contributes to knowledge of Austronesian cultures.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 104-2313-B-002 -014 -MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6833-8276</contrib-id><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yann-rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 104-2313-B-002 -014 -MY3) of Taiwan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.most.gov.tw/">https://www.most.gov.tw/</ext-link>) to YL.

Noting that the world population is highly dependent on a cereal-based diet with chronic micronutrient deficiency, enhancement of crop and nutritional diversity by developing resource use-efficient crops and accelerating biofortification is important to food security [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Foxtail millet (<italic>Setaria italica</italic> (L.) P. Beauv), with whole grain composed of 3.3% ash, 6.7% crude fiber, 4.0% crude fat, 11.2% crude protein, 63.2% starch, and 12% moisture, is highly nutritious in comparison with major cereals such as rice and wheat [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Its lysine richness suggests the possible use of foxtail millet as a supplementary protein source to most cereals, and the majority of its crude fat is unsaturated, such as linoleic acid [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, with a short growing season, good productivity on barren soils and adaptation to extreme environments such as drought tolerance, foxtail millet is a preferred choice for improving food and nutritional security in the semi-arid tropics. Foxtail millet ranks second in total world production among millets, cultivated as staple food in semi-arid tropics of Asia such as China and India, and as fodder and hay in Europe, North America, Australia, and North Africa [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Foxtail millet is an annual grass and self-pollinating species with a relatively short life cycle, small plant stature, abundant seed production, diploidy (2n = 2x = 18) with a small genome (~515 Mb), and high genetic diversity [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because foxtail millet and its wild progenitor, green foxtail, are easy to grow under low-input conditions and transformable as well, they have recently become a potential C<sub>4</sub> model for polyploid relatives such as switchgrass (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic> L.) and to address biological questions related to abiotic stress tolerance and the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The domestication of foxtail millet dates to ~6000 BC, with four major cultivated regions, China, Central Asia, Europe and the Near East, suggested as possible domestication centers [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent studies tend to support the hypothesis that foxtail millet domestication was monophyletic [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Taiwan, carbonized and charred seeds of foxtail millet unearthed in the Nan-kuan-li East site indicated that its cultivation dates to ~5,000 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Taiwanese indigenous peoples, Austronesian language speakers presently consisting of 16 ethnic groups, cultivate foxtail millet not only for staple food but for various delicacies including millet cakes, wine, and seasonings, that are served in ritual feasts and special occasions such as harvest festivals and weddings. Today, instead of declining like other millets, foxtail millet remains prestigious as a symbolic crop and food with more than 160 landraces recorded since the 1960&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. By cluster analysis with molecular markers, Taiwanese foxtail millet landraces were divided into three groups which were consistent with northern, central, and southern areas in Taiwan; additionally, the population structure and genetic diversity coincided with indigenous migration [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>As the major component of foxtail millet grain and other cereals, starch determines ultimate utilization of foxtail millet. In foxtail millet endosperm, amylose and highly branched amylopectin account for 20&#x02013;30% and 70&#x02013;80% of total starch, respectively. Amylose content (AC) is highly correlated with enzyme activity of granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), encoded by the <italic>Waxy</italic> (<italic>Wx</italic>) gene. Gene structures of non-waxy (wild-type) alleles in cereal crops, e.g. foxtail millet, sorghum, maize, and rice, share high similarity. Nevertheless, their <italic>waxy</italic> alleles are quite diverse because of mutations such as SNPs, small indels, or transposable element insertions, reducing expression of <italic>Wx</italic> and/or causing nonsynonymous mutations with consequently decreased and/or altered GBSSI activities [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In rice, <italic>Waxy</italic> alleles are mainly caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For instance, <italic>Wx</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>, the common allele in <italic>japonica</italic> rice, caused by alternative splicing of intron 1 that further affects the levels of mature <italic>Wx</italic> messenger RNA (mRNA), Wx protein (OsGBSS1), thus leading to low (12&#x02013;19%) AC in comparison with the wild-type allele, <italic>Wx</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> (22&#x02013;29%) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Seven representative haplotypes were identified from rice pan-genomes constituted from 66 rice accessions, revealed that 23-bp duplication at the second exon caused glutinous grains in addition to G/T at the intron 1&#x02013;exon 1 junction site [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alleles resulted from SNPs uncovered from landraces, e.g. <italic>Wx</italic><sup><italic>op</italic></sup>, <italic>Wx</italic><sup><italic>mq</italic></sup>, and <italic>Wx</italic><sup><italic>hp</italic></sup>, or mutated accessions affected AC, grain appearance, and eating and cooking quality as consequence [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In barley, the level of <italic>GBBSI</italic> mRNA was greatly reduced by the deletion of the promoter and/or 5&#x02019;UTR [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In maize, TE insertion altered <italic>Wx</italic> expression and reduced AC such as two alleles identified in Chinese maize landraces, <italic>wx-Cin4</italic> and <italic>wx-124</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and low AC were also brought by deletion mutations [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In wheat, inactive GBSSI was the outcomes of by SNPs, TE insertions, indels occurring at different <italic>Wx</italic> positions [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In sorghum, TE insertion and SNPs lead to four waxy alleles: <italic>wx</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup> (~1.63% AC), <italic>wx</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup> (~1.45%), <italic>wx</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>, and <italic>wx</italic><sup><italic>d</italic></sup> (0.71% AC) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In Job&#x02019;s tears (<italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic> L), a 275-bp deletion in exons 10 to 11 of <italic>Wx</italic>, leading to the lack of GBSSI protein, was found specific to Japanese and Korean waxy cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Broomcorn, proso, or common millet (<italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic> L.), an allotetraploidy cereal, has two homeologous <italic>Wx</italic> loci that <italic>GBSSI</italic>-S locus is the major locus while <italic>GBSSI-L</italic> has reduced enzyme activity. The genotype combinations of <italic>GBSSI-S</italic> and <italic>GBSSI-L</italic> alleles resulted from deletion, frameshift, and SNPs contributed to AC variation in cultivars and landraces corresponding to waxy endosperm. [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In foxtail millet, <italic>Wx</italic>, located on chromosome 4, is 4,211 bp long and contains fourteen exons with exons 2 to 14 encoding 605 amino acids. Thirteen alleles arisen from insertions of various TEs have been identified by PCR amplification [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Of these, types I and II are non-waxy; types III, II/VI (intragenic recombination), VI and IX are low AC; and types V, VII, VIII, X, and IV, including two derived types, IVa and IVb, are waxy. The hypothesis that waxy endosperm of foxtail millet might have evolved from the non-waxy wild-type after domestication, is supported by two facts&#x02013;(1) the wild progenitor of foxtail millet, green foxtail, possessed a non-waxy endosperm; and (2) <italic>Wx</italic> DNA sequences of non-waxy accessions were more diverse than those of low amylose and waxy types [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The AC of waxy endosperm is quite low or near 0% because of reduced expression or loss of function of <italic>Wx</italic> (<italic>wx</italic>), whereas the dominant <italic>Wx</italic> allele is associated with &#x0003e; 10% AC. According to AC variations, foxtail millet was classified into three types, namely non-waxy (17.0 to 31.9%), low-AC (7.8 to 16.0%) and waxy (0 to 3.5%) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Waxy type landraces of foxtail millet are mainly cultivated in East Asia and Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, a diversity panel of 124 foxtail millet accessions, including 8 varieties and 116 landraces collected from different tribes and regions in Taiwan, was subjected to AC and <italic>Wx</italic> genotype analyses. The impact of large TE insertions on AC was evaluated at both transcriptional and translational levels. This study provides new evidence regarding how <italic>Wx</italic> alleles affect expression profiles during grain filling and AC with consequences for foxtail millet. An intriguing inter-related question regards whether the geographic distribution of <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes could reflect the selection preferences of different ethnic groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials</title><p>A diversity panel of 124 accessions of Taiwan foxtail millet used in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210025.s003">S1 Table</xref>).

In general, glutinous foxtail millet is the most popular type for making traditional foods and wine. Sixty-one of 124 accessions (~49.2%) were identified as waxy (type IV), and were prevalent in southern Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g004">Fig 4</xref>). <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes identified in Taiwan had different geographic distributions, which were related to various ethnic groups.

Twenty-four accessions collected from Pingtung County where the Rukai and Paiwan peoples are distributed consist of 21%, 75%, and 4% type I, type IV and type IX, respectively. Among 50 accessions collected from Taitung County where Bunun and Paiwan peoples are distributed, type I, type IV, and type IX accounted for 10%, 58%, and 32% of the total, respectively.

Because of global climate change, foxtail and other millets, being water-efficient cereals, are proposed to replace rice for water savings and production of essential nutrients. Foxtail millet has been the only millet cultivated throughout Taiwan and a symbolic food served in festivals and rituals of indigenous peoples for more than 5,000 years. Since food products that deliver taste, color and texture with stable quality is the ultimate goal for which foxtail millet is utilized, grain quality is a major concern. In this study, AC and functional study of <italic>Wx</italic> alleles of 124 accessions were evaluated. Landraces were preserved because of indigenous preferences, contributing to the high diversity of foxtail millet collections in Taiwan reflected by four <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes with widely ranging AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Three mutated <italic>Wx</italic> alleles resulting from TE insertions reduce <italic>Wx</italic> expression and decrease GBSSI protein content, leading to low AC in the endosperm (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">3</xref>).

Four genotypes found in this study, type I, III, IV, IX, were consistent with previous reports about collections from Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Types IV and IX were waxy and low-AC, due to insertions of two <italic>En/Spm-like</italic> transposons, <italic>TSI-2</italic> with 5,250 bp and <italic>TSI-3</italic> with 2,823 bp, respectively. Type III, a low AC type, had additional insertion of a putative non-autonomous transposon <italic>TSI-6</italic>, with 1,226 bp in <italic>TSI-3</italic>.

The <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes from East and Southeast Asia were rich in various low-AC and waxy types in comparison with those from Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia, that mainly possessed type I. The AC (5.42&#x02013;16.92%) of the non-waxy types in Taiwanese landraces were generally lower than those of the same types from other regions such as East Asia, South Asia, and Western countries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210025.s005">S3 Table</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The majority of landraces in Taitung and Pingtung were type IV, with waxy grains, while type IX (low AC) was the majority in Nantou (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Notably, all five accessions identified as type III (low AC) were from Orchid Island, which is a small island situated off the southeastern coast of Taiwan.</p><p>Glutinous foxtail millet is favored by indigenous peoples for its physicochemical properties, which play an important role in making various kinds of foods and wine. Kida (1941) reported that about half of the local varieties collected from all over Taiwan in the 1930&#x02019;s was glutinous. In particular, glutinous varieties that possessed type IV allele were prevalent in southern Taiwan where Paiwan and Rukai peoples mainly distributed, while none were found in Batan Islands in the Philippines [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Foxtail millet dumplings, <italic>cinabu or cinavu</italic>, are grains of steamed and flavored foxtail millet wrapped with Macaranga or Khasya trichodesma leaves, which originated from Rukai and Paiwan peoples. A sticky cake is a general term representing several kinds of foods made from glutinous foxtail millet or rice. For example, Atayal people distributed in Nantou County makes sticky cake called <italic>hekkel</italic> by pounding steamed foxtail millet grain with a mortar and pestle until sticky paste forms. Another type of sticky cake, <italic>abai</italic>, is originated from Rukai and Paiwan peoples and its ingredients are similar to foxtail millet dumplings except dough is used rather than grains. In addition, in most of the ethnic groups except Tao, millet wine is ubiquitous, consumed daily and during ancestral worship as well. Therefore, these landraces were presumably preserved by indigenous people due to their preference for sticky properties in daily foods and beverages (<xref rid="pone.0210025.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Bunun people distributed in Nantou and Taitung counties prefer foxtail millet with low-AC endosperm for daily meals such as porridge, while the waxy type cultivated in a relatively small portion was mainly used for wine making. Interestingly, people have had a particular preference for glutinous cereals in East Asia. In addition to foxtail millet, waxy grains are very popular in landraces of several cereal crops, such as rice, maize, sorghum, barley, common millet, and Job&#x02019;s tears (<italic>Coix lacryma-jobi</italic>). For example, Job&#x02019;s tears is mainly cultivated in East Asia (e.g., Japan, Korea, and China), Southeast and South Asia for food, medicine and fodder. Many Job&#x02019;s tears cultivars have waxy endosperm derived from its non-waxy wild ancestor, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>lacryma-jobi</italic> var. <italic>lacryma jobi</italic> L. [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In this study of 124 accessions, four genotypes, type I, III, IV, and IX, were identified and accounted for 78% of AC variation in the range of 0.69&#x02013;16.92%. Types III, IV and IX resulted from insertions of <italic>TSI-3</italic> together with <italic>TSI-6</italic>, <italic>TSI-2</italic>, and <italic>TSI-3</italic>, with insertion sizes of 4,050 bp, 5,250 bp, and 2,823 bp in intron 1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). TE insertions of <italic>Wx</italic>, which lead to alternative splicing resulting in several transcripts, were found in maize [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, these three TE insertions into <italic>Wx</italic> in foxtail millet affected splicing efficiency rather than splicing accuracy, leading to low transcription levels of the same transcripts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">3A</xref>). The gene expression profiles during four grain filling stages demonstrated similar trends among these four genotypes, peaking at 10 DAF then declining, but nonetheless differing from each other significantly during the grain filling stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). At the peak stage, 10 DAF, <italic>Wx</italic> expression of type I was ~12, ~695, and ~11 fold higher than types III, IV, and IX, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Type IV, with the largest insertion, exhibited the lowest gene expression through grain filling stages, suggesting that its larger TE insertion had greater impact on splicing efficiency. The AAC of I-1 and I-2 were 14.35% and 15.26%, respectively, which might result from the difference in expression levels of these two accessions. However, in the other three mutated genotypes, there were no significant differences among the selected accessions.</p><p>In many plant species, starch biosynthetic enzymes can be divided into two categories, soluble and granule-associated [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The other group consists of internal granule-associated proteins that require gelatinization by boiling the starch in a buffer with SDS [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The molecular weight of GBSSI protein isolated from the immature endosperm of foxtail millet was ~60 kDa, while it was predicted to be ~66 kDa by using the Protein Molecular Weight Calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencegateway.org/tools/proteinmw.htm">http://www.sciencegateway.org/tools/proteinmw.htm</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This observation was consistent with other cereal crops, such as sorghum [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, the protein molecular weight of GBSSI in maize, rice, barley, wheat and dicot species were reported to be ~60 kDa [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. GBSSI protein sequences among different cereal crops were conserved and the sequences of sorghum and foxtail millet shared high similarity; thus, the antiserum of sorghum GBSSI could be applied to measure the amount of GBSSI in four different <italic>Wx</italic> genotypes of foxtail millet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p><p>Physicochemical properties reflected by the ratio of amylose and amylopectin are indices for starch utilization in various food and industrial applications. The proportions of amylose and amylopectin in cereal grains are regulated by starch synthesis genes, branching and debranching enzyme genes, and starch synthesis-related genes. <italic>Wx</italic> is the key gene to determine the GBSSI enzyme amount and activity, and consequently AC. This study showed that wild-type <italic>Wx</italic> alleles of sorghum and foxtail millet had the highest amounts of GBSSI and AC. In contrast, type IV, one of the mutated alleles, had the least GBSSI and lowest AC, while<strike>s</strike> type III and IX had intermediate GBSSI and low AC between wild-type and type IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). The low-AC accessions were capable of forming GBSSI but the decreased amount of protein led to relatively low AC in comparison with non-waxy types. However, rather than the absence of GBSSI protein mentioned in previous studies, waxy accessions still generate functional GBSSI even though its content was quite low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the diversity panel of 124 accessions, the AC ranges of type III, IV, and IX were significantly lower than type I. Variation of AC within the same genotypes might be caused by environmental effects, other starch synthesis related genes and interactions among genes and environment. Nevertheless, SNPs resulting in non-synonymous mutations could not be ruled out. One non-synonymous substitution that altered V 10 to A was uncovered within type I. Non-synonymous substitutions, R441L in type III and IX, and R521C in type III, were also observed among different types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In comparison with Yugu 1, all accessions from Taiwan had C rather than G at +234 and +2,387, which turned out to be synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, respectively. These SNPs might reduce enzyme activity to alter AC, a phenomenon that was very common in other cereal crops [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Type IX, the low-AC allele, had a distribution limited to Taiwan, the Philippines, and India.

Bunun people favored foxtail millets with slightly sticky endosperm called &#x0201c;malutas&#x0201d;, thus type IX was selected and cultivated in Bunun tribes [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] TypeIII, the low-AC allele, only occurred in a very restricted area, namely, the Philippines, Taiwan and Japan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210025.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Waxy and low-AC grains were relatively popular in Taiwan as well as in Korea and Japan, while non-waxy grains were dominant in other regions.</p><p>Type III was also found in the Nansei Islands of Japan with 2 accessions and the Philippines with 5 accessions, and Taiwan with 6 accessions. Five out of 6 accessions came from Orchid Island and the rest came from Pingtung County (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210025.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Among the landraces collected from Orchid Island, 3 of 4 accessions were classified as low-AC along with one waxy accession, and 2 of 3 accessions were type III with low AC and the other one was waxy [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the present study, however, all 5 accessions identified as type III are from Orchid Island. The uniqueness of the distribution of type III in Orchid Island, which is located 90 kilometers from the southeast coast of Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean, was assumed to be associated with the agricultural tradition and custom of the people indigenous to Orchid Island, the Tao. The Tao are the only non-Formosan Austronesian speakers among Taiwanese indigenous peoples [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Tao people traditionally rely heavily on fishing for survival, growing taro as a primary staple food, and they do not brew millet wine (<xref rid="pone.0210025.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, foxtail millet, a minor crop for the Tao, had been selected and cultivated for different purposes in Orchid Island, as compared to Taiwan Island.</p><p>Foxtail millet accessions collected from Taiwan clustered with those from the Nansei Islands and the Philippines, based on genetic relationships determined by transposon display (TD) of <italic>Wx</italic> alleles [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Two accessions of type III found in Japan came from Ikema and Ishigaki islands, which are closer to Taiwan than other islands among the Nansei such as Okinawa [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. No waxy landrace was found in Batanes in the Philippines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210025.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The Ivatan islanders are inhabitants of Itbayat in the Batanes, which is an archipelago located between Taiwan and the Philippines. The languages of the Tao and Ivatan belong to the 10<sup>th</sup> branch of the Austronesian language group, and these two populations share cultural similarities [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210025.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Northward gene flow from the Philippines to Orchid Island seemed to be independent of cultural interflow; in other words, trading resulted in linguistic affinity among Tao, Ivatan, and the Philippines, but had small impacts on genetic exchanges [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Type III foxtail millet found in the Nansei islands might have been introduced by Neolithic trading. Thus, the spread of this type might reflect the migration of Tao and their relatives.</p><p>Foxtail millet, a symbolic crop for indigenous people in Taiwan, has been cultivated for more than 5,000 years [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Since different ethnic peoples have their own cultures, foxtail millet has been applied in various food processing and worship practices (<xref rid="pone.0210025.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The distribution of 16 ethnic groups is mainly over much of the Central Mountain Range of the island. Hence, languages and cultures among different ethnic groups were relatively isolated and quite different from each other, with rare interactions and migrations between groups. Different preferred selections and little seed exchange might have contributed to the high genetic diversity of foxtail millet in Taiwan. The distribution of different genotypes was not even, for example type III only being found in Orchid Island, and type IX mainly distributed in Nantou County. However, type IV was commonly distributed within Taiwan island since glutinous grain was needed in brewing, festivals, and ancestor worship. Nevertheless, genetic drift due to small amounts of preserved seeds increasing genetic diversity could not be neglected.</p><p>Taiwan is the northernmost point of the distribution of the Austronesian people and is believed to be the origin of their expansion in prehistory. Orchid Island is located along the east coast of Taiwan between Ikema and Ishigaki islands in Japan, and Batanes in the Philippines, where type III accessions were also observed in the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In fact, archeological artifacts found in the eastern coast of Taiwan were also found on Orchid Island and Batanes, supporting the &#x0201c;Out of Taiwan&#x0201d; hypothesis of Austronesian expansion, indicating that settlement on the islands might date back to 4,000 YBP [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Several pieces of evidence also suggest that Taiwan is where the languages and cultures of the Austronesians originated thousands of years ago, which include people in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, the Maoris in New Zealand and Polynesians in Hawaii. Furthermore, the phylogeographic pattern of paper mulberry by using chloroplast DNA supported the &#x0201c;Out of Taiwan&#x0201d; hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0210025.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
