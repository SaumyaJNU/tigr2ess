By applying these methods, the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values for glutamic acid present in a wide variety of processed foods were obtained. Subsequently, discriminant analysis, which is a statistical analysis method, was performed by using the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values from seasoning MSG and glutamic acid from foodstuffs of known origin, and the discriminant function was derived. By substituting the measured &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of processed food samples into this discriminant function and classifying samples into two groups, seasoning MSG (the seasoning group) and glutamic acid in foodstuffs (the foodstuff group), we determined whether seasoning MSG had been used in the processed food samples. As a result, the accuracy of distinguishing between the seasoning group and the foodstuff group was very high, i.e., 96.2%, indicating that the proposed method is a highly robust and accurate method for determining whether seasoning MSG has been used in for processed foods.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Food analysis</kwd><kwd>Food science</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium salt of glutamic acid and is used worldwide as a typical umami seasoning. Glutamic acid is naturally present in many foodstuffs, including kelp, tomatoes, and cheese. On the other hand, the majority of MSG that is used as a seasoning is industrially produced by the fermentation of sugar cane molasses, corn, cassava, tapioca starch, among others [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">In recent years, there has been a consumer trend to avoid the intake of added MSG and an increased desire for natural-tasting food <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Indeed, in countries such as the United States, many processed foods bear the indication &#x0201c;No MSG&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;MSG free&#x0201d;. However, these processed foods also contain glutamic acid derived from foodstuffs, and it is difficult to distinguish glutamic acid from seasoning MSG <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Therefore, the development of technology to determine whether MSG is used as a seasoning in commercially available processed foods could provide highly reliable information to consumers, which is of particular interest for the current trend.</p><p id="p0020">Thus, to establish a method for distinguishing whether the glutamic acid present in food products is added seasoning MSG or natural glutamic acid, we utilized isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), as reported in our previous publications [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. IRMS has often been used in ecology and the geosciences to precisely measure the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The stable isotope ratios of these elements are also useful for determining the origin and authenticity of foodstuffs in the field of food science [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This approach is based on the principle that these isotope ratios in foodstuffs primarily reflect those that are either fixed or consumed by the organism from which the product is derived. In plants, the isotopic compositions of carbon and nitrogen (&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N) reflect those of carbon dioxide fixed via photosynthesis and of nitrogenous compounds in soil, respectively [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C of C4 plants, such as corn and sugarcane, significantly differs from that of C3 plants, including most crops, such as rice and wheat (C4: &#x02212;16&#x02030; to &#x02212;9&#x02030; vs. C3: &#x02212;34&#x02030; to &#x02212;24&#x02030;) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N is also used for estimating trophic levels, and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N of organisms with high trophic levels has high values because <sup>15</sup>N enrichment during trophic transfer integrates a number of biochemical processes that accompany isotopic fractionation during nitrogen metabolism [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, it should be possible to differentiate the origin of specimens based on isotopic composition differences.</p><p id="p0025">Initially, we developed a novel method to isolate glutamic acid from food samples and to subsequently measure &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C via elemental analyzer/isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In our subsequent report <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, we applied the previously reported method for measuring &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N in amino acids <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> to determine the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of glutamic acid with known origins in seasoning MSG (6 samples from C3 plants and 31 samples from C4 plants) and in various foodstuffs (53 samples). Using the obtained results, we performed a discriminant analysis, called quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), to classify glutamic acid according to its origin with a high success rate (accuracy of 96.7%).</p><p id="p0030">It has also been reported that differences exist in the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values for seasoning MSG and for glutamic acid in foodstuffs, and discriminant analysis has been shown to be able to distinguish between the two <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, we used of discriminant analysis to determine whether the glutamic acid present in commercially available processed food is glutamic acid from seasoning MSG or is inherently present in foodstuffs. Ultimately, we aimed to determine whether seasoning MSG was used in processed food samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Samples</title><p id="p0035">As representative examples of processed foods, we purchased instant noodles (19 samples), instant soups (7 samples), potato chips (5 samples), retort curry (4 samples), cheese (3 samples), salad dressing (2 samples), hamburger patties (2 samples), chicken nuggets (2 samples), ham (2 samples), sausages (2 samples), bacon (2 samples) and canned fish (2 samples) in which it was obvious whether seasoning MSG was added from the declaration on the packages (e.g., &#x0201c;No MSG&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;MSG free&#x0201d;) or the ingredient list (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>(A)).

To minimize the influence of the glutamic acid derived from the sample, an MSG reagent (&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C = &#x02212;14.7&#x02030;, &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N = 5.6&#x02030; by EA/IRMS) was added in excess to the processed food samples with relatively low glutamic acid contents so that the proportion of glutamic acid originating from the MSG reagent was &#x02265;95%.

Furthermore, the results of the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N measurements were such that the standard deviation for N = 5 was &#x0003c;0.4&#x02030;, and the difference relative to the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of the added MSG reagent (at &#x02212;5.6&#x02030;) was between &#x02212;0.3 and 0.5&#x02030;.

First, in addition to seasoning MSG, the raw materials of the processed foods can also contain free glutamic acid, which could then influence the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values. A remarkable example would be the canned fish (tuna) of sample No. 51. Although seasoning MSG had been added, this sample was erroneously classified in the foodstuff group instead of the two seasoning groups. In general, tuna contains &#x0223c;1&#x02013;10 mg/100 g of free glutamic acid <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and large fish such as tuna are known to have high &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values (&#x02265;20&#x02030;) [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Based on such facts, the free glutamic acid derived from the tuna may have shifted the &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N value of the added seasoning MSG itself to the plus side. The second possible explanation could be unintended seasoning MSG contamination during the manufacturing process. Indeed, there are cases (e.g., sample No. 22, instant soup) for which samples were classified into the seasoning group due to the influence of MSG added to the raw materials used to prepare the processed food, despite the fact that no seasoning MSG had been directly added by the final manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Determination of the presence or absence of added MSG via discriminant analysis between the seasoning group and the foodstuff group</title><p id="p0155">The discriminant analysis in Section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>. classified the samples into three groups of glutamic acid origin, namely, the C3 plant-derived seasoning group, the C4 plant-derived seasoning group, and the foodstuff group; thus, so that the originating plant of the seasoning MSG (i.e., the C3 or C4 plant) could be distinguished. However, in practice, it is particularly desirable to determine whether seasoning MSG has been used, and the priority is to discriminate it with as high accuracy as possible. We therefore combined the C3 plant-derived seasoning group and the C4 plant-derived seasoning group into a single group (i.e., the seasoning group) and attempted to perform a two-group discriminant analysis.</p><p id="p0160">For this purpose, the discrimination analysis between the two groups was performed using the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values from seasoning MSG and glutamic acid in foodstuffs of known origin that were acquired in our previous report <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and the discriminant function obtained was as follows:<disp-formula id="ufd4">Function 3: 0.153 [&#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N] &#x02013; 0.057 [&#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C] &#x02013; 1.125.</disp-formula></p><p id="p0165">Subsequently, we substituted the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values obtained for the glutamic acid present in the processed foods into discriminant function 3, determined the discriminant score (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>), and analyzed to which group each sample belonged (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>(C)). As a result, 21 out of the 22 samples containing added seasoning MSG were classified into the seasoning group, while the remaining sample was classified into the foodstuff group. Furthermore, 29 out of 30 samples without any added MSG were classified into the foodstuff group, and the remaining sample was classified into the seasoning group. In total, 50 out of 52 samples were classified correctly with an accuracy of 96.2%, which was a superior result compared with that obtained with the method described in Section <xref rid="sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> (accuracy of 90.4%).

To measure the &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of glutamic acid in processed food samples, glutamic acid was isolated at high purity and subjected to EA/IRMS for &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C measurements, while &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N measurements were performed by GC/C/IRMS after purification and derivatization. When discriminant analysis was performed based on the obtained &#x003b4;<sup>13</sup>C and &#x003b4;<sup>15</sup>N values of glutamic acid in various processed foods, the accuracy of distinguishing between the seasoning group and the foodstuff group was very high, i.e., 96.2%.
