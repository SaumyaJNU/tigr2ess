Its strong potency against obesity, metabolic disorders, vascular disease, inflammation, and various cancers has already been reported. Large amounts of wine or grapes need to be consumed to obtain the amount of resveratrol required for biological activity. Pure resveratrol at concentrations as low as 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M induces cytotoxicity to normal cells. To overcome these limitations, we prepared genetically modified resveratrol-enriched rice (RR). We previously reported the strong antiaging potential of RR against ultraviolet B/reactive oxygen species-induced toxicity in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). As aging is characterized by neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we further evaluated the role of RR against LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RR inhibited nitric oxide production and the expression of inflammatory proteins such as iNOS and COX-2. RR significantly modulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, activator protein AP-1 signaling, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) mediated transcription of inflammatory proteins via inhibition of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation, IkB phosphorylation, and proinflammatory cytokine productions such as interleukin IL-6, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). These findings show that the strong antineuroinflammatory effects of RR can be beneficial for aging-mediated neurodegenerative conditions as well as disorders of the central nervous system caused by neuroinflammation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning</funding-source><award-id>NRF-2017R1A4A 1015594</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Rural Development Administration</funding-source><award-id>01118803</award-id><award-id>PJ01369101</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is the major cause and aggravating factor of various acute or chronic pathological conditions, including photoaging, diabetes, and cancer [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly, neuroinflammation is the key mediator of secondary brain damage in most of the neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Prion disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and neuropathic pain [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Neuroinflammation is induced by aging-dependent conditions and aging-independent pathological events, which share similar inflammatory cascades [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Microglia, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes are the basic cells of the brain. Microglia and astrocytes, as glial cells, have a role to defend against brain injury to maintain homeostasis and repair brain injury. In aging-dependent conditions and aging-independent disorders such as AD, PD, and stroke, neuroinflammation can be initiated by chronic microglial activation. Activated microglia are required for basic immune defense in the brain; however, chronic microglial activation is toxic to the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conversion of normal microglia to toxic microglial M1 phenotype is responsible for the initiation of inflammation in the CNS through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), proteases, arachidonic acids, excitatory amino acids, and cytokines [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These neurotoxic substances are responsible for the disruption of architecture and function of neurons, synaptic degeneration, neuronal loss, and ultimately neurodegeneration [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The production of ROS and other inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress are closely related to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, as well as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) and activator protein- (AP-) 1-mediated transcription [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, natural compounds or nutraceuticals with the potential to regulate these steps to control microglial activation will be promising candidates for inhibiting neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative conditions. Although advances have been made to treat such neuroinflammatory conditions, there is a lack of effective therapeutic strategy to cure these disease conditions. In the past few decades, there has been a growing interest toward alternative medicines, especially phytochemicals, as therapeutic agents for neurological disorders involving activated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Resveratrol has been studied for decades for its multifunctional potency against many human ailments [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], including neuroinflammatory conditions [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Resveratrol is widely present in a number of grape species, berries, peanuts, soy, and red wine [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; however, we have to consume a large amount of these foods to get the sufficient amount of resveratrol required for its biological activity [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, the cytotoxic nature of resveratrol on normal cells overshadows its extensive potential against human ailments [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To overcome this limitation and achieve therapeutic potential, resveratrol-enriched rice (RR) was developed by taking advantage of genetic engineering [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we developed RR through genetic engineering techniques, as described previously [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Rice is a main food component among Asian population, and therefore, rice consumption is higher than other food components. Resveratrol biosynthesis gene was transcribed into normal dongjin rice (NR) to produce RR. We previously reported that RR has a better potency to inhibit ultraviolet B (UVB)/ROS-induced aging by maintaining matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1)/procollagen I (PIP) balance an inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis, without any cellular toxicity [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>RR can be used safely and more effectively in cases where resveratrol shows efficacy to treat or control neuroinflammatory conditions. Therefore, in this study, we compared the efficacy of NR, RR, and resveratrol in terms of cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory potential in activated microglia and elucidated the possible mechanisms underlying the antineuroinflammatory potential of RR in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated BV2 murine microglial cells. We hope our research clearly revealed the additive role of RR from NR and resveratrol which could be the best alternative treatment for the neuronal disorders induced by neuroinflammation like AD, PD, and MS lesions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

During this period, the extraction mixture was placed in an ultrasonic water bath with sonication. After 60&#x02009;min incubation of the extraction mixture with sonication, the mixture was filtered (HYUNAI Micro N0.20 filter paper, Korea) and then evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 40&#x000b0;C for the removal of methanol. The evaporated extract yield was further freeze-dried for complete lyophilization of the extract. The final yield of the extract powder was stored and used for experiment.

The cells cultured in 96-well plates were treated with different concentrations of samples (NR, RR, and resveratrol) with or without LPS. In the pretreatment condition, the samples were pretreated in the seeded plates, and LPS (100&#x02009;ng/mL) was added 30&#x02009;min after sample treatment.

The conditioned medium (50&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L) was transferred to a new 96-well plate and mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent.

NR, RR, and Resveratrol Significantly Inhibit Nitrite Production in LPS-Activated Microglia</title><p>NO production is an important biomarker for almost all types of inflammation, especially LPS-induced neuroinflammation. We evaluated the nitrite oxide level of NR, RR, and resveratrol with L-NMMA as the positive control against LPS-activated BV2 microglial NO production. NR and RR showed the highest potency to inhibit nitrite production. Also, a resveratrol showed excellent potency at a high concentration (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). However, NR and RR showed better potency than resveratrol at concentrations of 1 and 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. Although RR extract has lesser amount of pure resveratrol than resveratrol, it has higher potency with lower IC<sub>50</sub> value, suggesting that RR does not cause cellular toxicity. The effect of RR (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL) on nitrite production is statistically significant to that of NR alone suggesting that RR has better potency than that of the NR. NR and RR treatment protected against LPS-induced toxicity, especially up to a concentration 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, by increasing the number of viable cells. In case of resveratrol treatment, only 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL protected against LPS toxicity by increasing the viable cells, but not 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. NR and RR treatment at concentrations of 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL and 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL demonstrated higher potency in inhibiting nitrite production than L-NMMA, suggesting that NR and RR are better alternatives than L-NMMA for nitrite production inhibition as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. RR Treatment Inhibits the Expression of iNOS and COX-2 in Acute and Chronic LPS Activation</title><p>As iNOS and COX-2 proteins are precursors of NO production and inflammatory cascades, we further evaluated the role of NR and RR in regulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells for acute as well as chronic activation conditions. LPS treatment in BV2 cells significantly increased the expression of iNOS and COX-2. We performed acute microglial activation, which is the incubation of cells with a compound and LPS for 6&#x02009;h, to determine the altered expression of iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells. We also performed incubation for 24&#x02009;h, which is defined as chronic microglial activation, and evaluated the expression of iNOS and COX-2. We found that NR and resveratrol showed a high potency to inhibit COX-2 expression in acute and chronic activation conditions. When compared with NR and R, RR demonstrated poor but significant efficacy in acute activation, but no significant activity in chronic activation. In contrast, RR exhibited the highest potency to inhibit iNOS expression in both acute and chronic activation conditions. NR and resveratrol did not demonstrate significant inhibition of iNOS in chronic activation condition, while a significant potency was observed in acute activation condition as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The effect of RR on inhibition of iNOS expression is statistically significant in comparison to the NR. This result suggests that additive effect of NR and R on RR is more significant than that on NR and R alone for the inhibition of iNOS expression. We hypothesized that the potent iNOS/NO inhibiting ability of RR might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3.

However, interestingly, normal rice alone also showed the antineuroinflammatory effect against LPS-treated BV2 cells.

We observed that treatment of the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol significantly inhibited the production of nitrite in LPS-activated microglia. As we treated the sample of 1, 10, 100, and 1000&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL concentration, potency of sample shows concentration-dependent manner and did not show any cellular toxicity as evidenced by cell viability assay. Although <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol has been reported to inhibit LPS-induced macrophage cell toxicity previously [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], here, we found the similar potency of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol to inhibit the inflammatory mediators against LPS-activated microglia as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. NR, RR, and R Can Modulate MAPK Signaling in Acute LPS-Activated BV2 Microglial Cells</title><p>MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues, which in turn leads to a signaling cascade that upregulates the production of inflammatory mediators as well as proinflammatory cytokines in activated microglia or under other inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we evaluated the role of NR and RR in altering the activation/phosphorylation of MAPK proteins (p38, JNK, and ERK). LPS-activated microglia showed significantly increased phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and P38, which might be responsible for the induction of transcription of inflammatory mediators. Treatment of LPS-activated BV2 cells with NR and RR significantly reduced expression of phosphorylated JNK and P38. In case of ERK phosphorylation, only RR showed high efficacy, while NR did not demonstrate significant inhibition. The effect of RR is statistically significant in both the treated concentration to inhibit the ERK phosphorylation in comparison to the NR alone. This data suggested that additive effect of NR and resveratrol in RR is more significant than in NR and R alone. Resveratrol showed slightly different pattern in the MAPK modulation where it showed increase of JNK phosphorylation although it is not significant. Also, it did not show any changes in ERK phosphorylation whereas it significantly inhibited the p38 phosphorylation. NR and RR exhibited high potency to inhibit P38 phosphorylation than that of the ERK and JNK as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Among all, RR showed the highest potency to inhibit the phosphorylation of all the MAPK's specially at 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL. These findings suggest that RR treatment inhibits pJNK, pERK, and pP38 nonspecifically and its potency is higher than NR and resveratrol itself.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>3.5. NR, RR, and R Modulate AP-1 Signaling in LPS-Activated BV2 Microglial Cells</title><p>Next, we assessed the expression of AP-1 proteins. Toxicant-induced activation of MAPK is responsible for the activation of AP-1 (C-Fos and C-Jun) in inflammatory response and other conditions [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we observed that the significant inhibition of pERK, pJNK, and pP38 by RR treatment was further confirmed by the downregulated expression of p-C-Fos and p-C-Jun under the similar treatment conditions as that for NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B. NR and RR treatment at a concentration of 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL inhibited the expression of p-C-Fos where NR and RR significantly inhibited the expression of p-C-Jun at both the treated concentrations (10 and 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). The effect of RR is statistically significant on both the treated concentration in comparison to the NR alone suggesting that additive effect of NR and resveratrol in RR is more significant than the NR and R alone. P38, JNK, and ERK activation is required for C-Jun activation. RR treatment downregulated p-C-Jun expression, indicating its strong anti-inflammatory effects against activated microglia as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. As resveratrol did not significantly change the JNK and ERK phosphorylation, that result was further supported by the unchanged phosphorylation of C-Fos and C-Jun after resveratrol treatment. This data supported the fact that C-Jun and C-Fos phosphorylation were correlated with JNK and ERK phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6. NR, RR, and Resveratrol Modulate NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B Translocation in LPS-Activated BV2 Microglial Cells</title><p>Transcription factors play an important role in the increased production of inflammatory proteins and proinflammatory cytokines. NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and AP-1 play the key roles as transcription factors under inflammatory conditions. In this study, we evaluated the role of NR, RR, and resveratrol against activated microglia-induced NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation and I-kB phosphorylation. LPS treatment to BV2 cells significantly increased the translocation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B from the cytosol to the nucleus, as well as the phosphorylation of I-kB. These events together can increase transcription. However, NR, RR, and resveratrol treatment reversed these events. LPS-activated BV2 cells treated with RR showed the highest expression of cytosolic NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and the lowest expression of nucleolar NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B. RR treatment significantly increased the cytosolic NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and decreased the nuclear one which is statistically significant to that of NR-treated group as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, suggesting the better potency of RR to that of NR alone. The inhibition of translocation was further supported by the significant inhibition of phosphorylated I-kB as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In all these cases, RR demonstrated the highest potency at both the treated concentrations, suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B/I-kB-mediated transcription of inflammatory proteins.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>3.7. NR and RR Can Modulate MAPK Signaling in Chronic LPS-Activated BV2 Microglial Cells</title><p>We evaluated the role of NR, RR, and resveratrol in altering the activation/phosphorylation of MAPK proteins (p38, JNK, and ERK) under chronic (24&#x02009;h) LPS activation condition in BV2 cells. Inhibition of pJNK by NR and RR was more significant in chronic activation than in acute activation. None of the samples inhibited ERK phosphorylation in chronic activation condition, rather NR treatment significantly increased pERK expression that might suggest for its cell survival capacity against chronic activation of microglia. RR treatment also showed a slight increase in pERK expression, but it was not significant when compared with LPS-only-treated group. In case of P38 phosphorylation, although all the treated samples inhibited pP38 expression, only RR treatment showed significant inhibition when compared with LPS-only-treated group as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.8"><title>3.8. NR, RR, and Resveratrol Treatment Inhibits Production of Proinflammatory Cytokines</title><p>RR-mediated inhibition of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B/I-kB transcription revealed the reason for the marked inhibition of nitrite levels and iNOS/COX-2 expression. This was further confirmed through the measurement of proinflammatory cytokine levels in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells. NR, RR, and resveratrol demonstrated almost similar potency to inhibit PGE2 secretion, while resveratrol showed the highest potency for inhibition of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6 production as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The effect of RR for the inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines is significantly higher in comparison to the NR alone as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, suggesting the better potency of RR to that of NR alone. As resveratrol, the pure compound, and extracts of NR and RR demonstrated almost equipotent ability to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production, it can be suggested that RR is sufficiently capable to inhibit the production of not only inflammatory mediators but also proinflammatory cytokines.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In this study, we reported the antineuroinflammatory properties of RR for the first time. We compared the cytotoxicity of RR with NR and resveratrol in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. In addition, we determined the effects of RR, NR, and resveratrol on the various parameters of neuroinflammation, including COX2, iNOS, nitric oxide, MAPK signaling in both acute and chronic conditions of activated microglia, AP-1 and NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling, and inflammatory mediator production in activated microglia. Our findings revealed that RR showed equal or higher anti-inflammatory efficacy than resveratrol alone, without any cytotoxicity.</p><p>Neuroinflammation and brain aging leads to continuous degeneration of brain function [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Aging process specifically targets the brain, cardiovascular system, and metabolic system, either in intrinsic or extrinsic aging [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Aging as well as neuroinflammation is the key mediator of neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and PD [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As RR treatment significantly attenuated UVB-induced skin aging, metabolic disorders, and hyperpigmentation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in our previous study, we further designed an experiment to determine their effect against neuroinflammation, which is a major cause of almost all neurological disorders [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Potent inhibition of inflammation by RR treatment in UVB/ROS-induced dermal fibroblasts in our previous report serves as a cue for this experiment [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As neuroinflammation caused by overactivated microglia can aggravate neurodegeneration in AD, PD, MS, and ischemic stroke, [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], controlling microglial activation could be a potential strategy for the management of these disorders. Acute but strong activation of microglia is observed in ischemic stroke, while chronic microglial activation and neuroinflammation are observed in AD, PD, and MS [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], indicating that inhibition of microglial activation and its inflammatory cascades is the key therapy against such CNS disorders. Resveratrol, a multifunctional phytochemical, has a proven efficacy against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and asthma via alterations in the gut microbiome [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Human gut microbiota play an important role in the treatment of various CNS disorders, including neuroinflammation regulation in dementia [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is also possible that the RR-mediated antineuroinflammatory effect might be exerted through the alteration of gut microbiome. Resveratrol at high concentrations might be toxic to the gut microbiome, but RR is completely safe to normal cells as shown in our previous study.</p><p>NO production by overactivated microglia is a key biomarker for neuroinflammation in CNS disorders. In a preliminary study, the treatment of NR, RR, and resveratrol showed significant inhibition of nitrite production in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells, without cellular toxicity. Therefore, we decided to perform a mechanistic study. The inhibition of nitrite production and the IC<sub>50</sub> value for nitrite release was lower in the RR-treated group than in NR-, resveratrol-, and L-NMMA-treated groups. Increased expression of iNOS is necessary for the increased production and release of NO by activated microglia, whereas COX2 expression is required for its induction of arachidonic acid pathway via increased PGE2 production. In different edible plants, phytochemicals such as sulforaphane, resveratrol, and curcumin have antineuroinflammatory role either through the Sirt1 and NRF2 activation or inhibition of the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation and transcription of the inflammatory proteins [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly, NR also possesses the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, tocopherols, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-oryzanol, and phytic acid [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. NR contains the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol, and tocotrienol as active ingredients [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] which have the potential to inhibit the cytotoxicity against LPS [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In specific, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol and its metabolites inhibited the cyclooxygenase activity followed by the inhibition of PGE2 in macrophages and epithelial cells [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This finding is also supported by our data that treatment of NR containing <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol significantly inhibited the COX-2 expression as well as PGE2 production in acute and chronic microglial activation. In addition, we evaluated the effect of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol and found that treatment of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol not only inhibited the nitrite production but also attenuated the expression of iNOS and COX-2 without cellular toxicity up to the concentration of 1&#x02009;mg/mL. This data revealed that phytochemicals such as <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol in NR were responsible for the anti-inflammatory potential. In addition to this, their presence and their effectiveness/safety profile over resveratrol toxicity make RR a better candidate against neuroinflammation. As inhibition of COX-2 by NR and its phytochemicals is more prominent and COX-2 is involved in the induction of pain [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the applicability of NR might be highly promising in neuropathic pain model. RR exhibited a minor role in inhibiting COX-2 expression; however, its potency to inhibit iNOS under acute and chronic neuroinflammatory conditions was higher than that of resveratrol and NR. These results collectively support the fact that the higher potency of RR in inhibiting iNOS expression was responsible for its higher potency in inhibiting nitrite production. For a compound or sample to inhibit inflammatory cascades, they must control the inflammatory signaling pathways such as MAPK signaling. This in turn helps in regulating NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation, followed by I-kB degradation and AP-1 signaling, and these events facilitate the transcription of inflammatory proteins and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Treatment of activated microglia with RR significantly inhibited the expression of MAPK proteins as evidenced by attenuated phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and P38 under acute activation condition. Resveratrol treatment significantly increased the expression of JNK, probably because of its cytotoxic nature to normal cells, while RR downregulated the expression of JNK. These results collectively symbolize the superiority of RR over resveratrol in modulating MAPK signaling. This effect was further confirmed in chronic activation condition. LPS exposure to microglia up to 24&#x02009;h results in chronic activation and induces continuous cascades of neuroinflammation via inflammatory signaling and inflammatory protein production [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. RR treatment significantly inhibited the activation of JNK and p38, but it did not show any significant effect on ERK phosphorylation. MAPK signaling takes place within a very short time of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation; however, in chronic microglial activation, JNK and p38 phosphorylation play imperative roles in inflammatory cascade maintenance and induction [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our study, RR treatment inhibited JNK and p38 phosphorylation with a higher potency than resveratrol treatment. Notably, the potency of NR to inhibit pJNK expression in acute and chronic activation conditions was higher than that of RR and resveratrol alone, which could explain the increase in pJNK expression by resveratrol and significant inhibition of pJNK expression by RR. ERK activation has a dual role: short-term activation occurs during inflammation and long-term activation occurs during cell survival [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The increase/insignificant inhibition of pERK expression by NR suggests its role against LPS-induced toxicity by increasing the survival of microglia. Interventions that can control JNK and ERK activation will alter the expression of AP-1 signaling [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Resveratrol increased the expression of pJNK and p-C-Jun expression, while RR treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of pJNK and p-C-Jun. Both NR and RR inhibited p-C-Jun and p-C-Fos expression, but resveratrol did not show a similar effect. Furthermore, we assessed the role of RR against NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B translocation and I-kB degradation. We observed significantly higher amounts of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B in the cytosol and lower amounts in the nucleus in the RR-treated group, indicating that RR inhibited the translocation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B from the cytosol to the nucleus. Additionally, significantly low levels of phosphorylated I-kB in the cytosol confirmed that RR inhibited the degradation of I-kB in activated microglia, suggesting the strong antineuroinflammatory effects of RR against activated microglia. Although the resveratrol is a pure compound, we used here to compare the effectiveness of RR (extract of resveratrol-enriched rice) in comparison to NR (extract of normal rice) and resveratrol alone. NR, RR, and R treatment showed the different potencies in different concentrations for inhibition of inflammatory parameters. The highest concentration of resveratrol, i.e., 100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, showed the highest potency but it also possessed the cellular toxicity. We found the potential effect of RR that seems to act in synergistic effect of NR and resveratrol. NR also showed good potency to inhibit the inflammatory cascades. Therefore, we hypothesized that the presence of phytochemicals <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol in NR can boost the activity of RR either they can help for the protection of cells against resveratrol-mediated cell death or morphological changes. We evaluated the potential antineuroinflammatory effect of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol in rice and found that treatment of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol inhibited not only the nitrite production but also the expression of iNOS and COX-2 without cellular toxicity up to the concentration of 1&#x02009;mg/mL. This data supports that active phytochemicals including <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol in NR are responsible for the anti-inflammatory potential in LPS-treated BV2 cells. Also, we found that the RR-treated group significantly showed the higher potency of RR than resveratrol-treated group alone in experimental group. Hence, the most notable achievement of this study was the improved efficacy of resveratrol following preparation of pharmaceutical crops (rice) containing resveratrol, which showed negligible toxicity on microglial cells.</p><p>In this study, we not only discovered the safe and effective role of RR against aging and neuroinflammation but also identified the antineuroinflammatory potential of NR itself is because of the presence of active phytochemicals such as <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-tocopherol in rice. The anti-inflammatory effect by RR treatment seems to be mediated through inhibition of nitrite production, MAPK phosphorylation, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines, and expressions of inflammatory proteins which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> as a summarized figure. Thus, consumption of RR as a functional food will not only act as a nutritional food component but also as a medicinal ambrosia for the prevention and treatment of various human disorders. Further research should be performed to evaluate the antineuroinflammatory potential of RR in various neuroinflammatory disorders through both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (no.
