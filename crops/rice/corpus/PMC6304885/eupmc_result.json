    "Resveratrol, a natural stilbenoid, is produced by several plants, especially grape vines. Its strong potency against obesity, metabolic disorders, vascular disease, inflammation, and various cancers has already been reported. Large amounts of wine or grapes need to be consumed to obtain the amount of resveratrol required for biological activity. Pure resveratrol at concentrations as low as 10 μM induces cytotoxicity to normal cells. To overcome these limitations, we prepared genetically modified resveratrol-enriched rice (RR). We previously reported the strong antiaging potential of RR against ultraviolet B/reactive oxygen species-induced toxicity in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). As aging is characterized by neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, we further evaluated the role of RR against LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RR inhibited nitric oxide production and the expression of inflammatory proteins such as iNOS and COX-2. RR significantly modulated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, activator protein AP-1 signaling, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mediated transcription of inflammatory proteins via inhibition of NF-κB translocation, IkB phosphorylation, and proinflammatory cytokine productions such as interleukin IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). These findings show that the strong antineuroinflammatory effects of RR can be beneficial for aging-mediated neurodegenerative conditions as well as disorders of the central nervous system caused by neuroinflammation."
