    "Most Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and gene isolation approaches, such as positional- or map-based cloning, are time-consuming and low-throughput methods. Understanding and detecting the genetic material that controls a phenotype is a key means to functionally analyzing genes as well as to enhance crop agronomic traits. In this regard, high-throughput technologies have great prospects for changing the paradigms of DNA marker revealing, genotyping, and for discovering crop genetics and genomic study. Bulk segregant analysis, based on whole genome resequencing approaches, permits the rapid isolation of the genes or QTL responsible for the causative mutation of the phenotypes. MutMap, MutMap Gap, MutMap+, modified MutMap, and QTL-seq methods are among those approaches that have been confirmed to be fruitful gene mapping approaches for crop plants, such as rice, irrespective of whether the characters are determined by polygenes. As a result, in the present study we reviewed the progress made by all these methods to identify QTL or genes in rice."
