This study used lactic acid fermentation as a pre-treatment technology to evaluate the sanitization effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on FS. A combination of fermented rice flour and brown sugar was used as the medium to prepare LAB, and fecal coliforms were used as the indicator organisms. The addition of a LAB suspension grown in fermented rice flour and brown sugar to FS was studied to evaluate the survival of fecal coliforms. The pH decreased during ongoing lactic acid fermentation after the addition of the LAB suspension. The results revealed that fecal coliforms in reactors containing 1:1 and 2:1 w/w of FS and LAB suspension decreased to half of the initial concentration within seven days of the treatment process in comparison with that of the control reactor. Viable plate counts of 0.6&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup>, 0.9&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup>, and 2.4&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup>&#x0202f;CFU/100&#x0202f;mL were recorded from reactors 1:1, 2:1, and the control, respectively. The total elimination of the fecal coliforms below the detection limit (&#x0003c;3 log 10&#x0202f;CFU/100&#x0202f;mL) was observed in both reactors after 15&#x02013;17 days, whereas the number of fecal coliforms remained at 2.3&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup>&#x0202f;CFU/100&#x0202f;mL in the control reactor. The fecal coliforms were eliminated because of the acidification caused by the LAB during the incubation time. The final pH in the treatment reactors 1:1 and 2:1 was 3.7 and 3.9. While the final pH in the control reactor was 7.91. The results revealed that the bacterial pathogens in FS can be completely eliminated through a low-cost technique and a simple lactic acid fermentation process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="egi10LVKV4DCLT"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">A combination of fermented rice flour and brown sugar was used to produce lactic acid.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Fecal coliform was inactivated within a short period of time.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Fecal pH was permanently reduced during treatment process.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Fecal pathogen was eliminated through a low cost and easy to use lactic acid fermentation technique.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fecal sludge</kwd><kwd>Coliform bacteria</kwd><kwd>Lactic acid bacteria</kwd><kwd>Fermented rice flour</kwd><kwd>Brown sugar</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Recent works aim to improve the sustainability of fecal sludge (FS) management for resource recovery (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Andreev et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bracken et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; World Health Organization <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">(WHO) &#x00026; (UNICEF), 2014</xref>).

Given its nutrient contents, human feces could increase the soil fertility to achieve sustainable agriculture (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kimetu et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). However, the high concentrations of pathogens and several harmful organisms that are found in feces can contaminate the soil and crops (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">al-Ghazali and al-Azawi, 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bracken et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Fresh human feces contains high amounts of pathogens, such as fecal coliforms, Helminth eggs, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, fecal streptococcus, and other bacteria, all of which are harmful to humans (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gold et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Langergraber and Muellegger, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Yemaneh, 2015</xref>). The direct use of FS in agriculture results in unhygienic conditions (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dold and Holland, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Forbis-Stokes et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Langergraber and Muellegger, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The different techniques typically used to reduce the infectious potential of feces vary in effectiveness. Several treatment methods, including ammonia treatment, lime addition, yeast treatment, and lactic acid fermentation (LAF), have been proposed to reduce the pathogens in FS (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 2015a</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Factura et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Feachem et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>). Although these methods have been proven feasible, they are hindered by several drawbacks. For example, although lime treatment can increase the settling efficiency, the pH declines again after the initial reaction, thereby requiring the addition of high amounts of lime. In addition, bacteria pathogens can regrow over time. The concerns in this process include, lime scaling, ammonia odors and pathogen regrowth after a few days (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Strande et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In particular, ammonia treatment is applicable in areas with urine diverting dehydrating toilets (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nordin et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). The cost increases in cases where synthetic urea should be applied, thereby limiting the economic feasibility and sustainability of the technology (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Strande et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Another constraint is the stability of nitrogen in end-treatment products and the achievement of full-nutrient benefits. Ammonia disinfection is effective in urine, sewage sludge, and compost (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adamtey et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allievi et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>); however, its applications to FS are still in the research phase of development (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Magri et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">The stabilization of FS through a fermentation and acidification process is one of the most reliable methods for pathogen inactivation and odor control (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mackie Jensen et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Verbyla et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Yemaneh et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). LAF is a cheap method that can be achieved through acidification at pH&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;4 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 2015b</xref>). LAF of feces is a simple and economical method that can be achieved through acidification (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Andreev et&#x000a0;al., 2017a</xref>). However, a number of LAB species do not produce effective lactic acids for pathogen inactivation in FS. For example, cassava is known for producing LABs such as <italic>Pediococcus, Lactobacillus fermenttum</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Colehour et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lacerda et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sanni et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). When lactic acid from fermented cassava flour was used to sanitize FS, the pH and pathogens did not significantly decrease (data not shown). Thus, effective and cheap lactic acid from food wastes must be produced to sanitize FS and preserve its nutrient value as fertilizer and reduces energy input.</p><p id="p0045">Fermented rice water allows the growth of LAB (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). However, no concrete information is available as regards the effectivity of the lactic acid produced from the combination of fermented rice flour and brown sugar for the inactivation of pathogens in FS. Given that the fermentation of rice flour is generally a non-controlled procedure, the LAB production through this process varies (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Strande et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, to produce effective lactic acid from rice, the microbial growth and population during fermentation must be understood.</p><p id="p0050">This study provided insight into the sensitive practicality of the resource-oriented sanitation of FS through lactic fermentation.

Approximately 0.02&#x0202f;kg of brown sugar was added to 1.98&#x0202f;kg w/w of rice flour during the fermentation process. The main stages involved in producing lactic acid from fermented rice flour include boiling, cooling, and fermenting with the addition of brown sugar. Soaking is important for the production of fermented rice flour because it increases the water content of rice and enhances the natural fermentation process. 50&#x0202f;mL of deionized water was added to enhance the fermentation. The process was conducted in a wooden box and covered with a woolen material. Fermentation increased the lactic acid content of the process because of the metabolism of the involved LAB (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lu et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).

The overall stability in the variation of the LAB concentration in the treatment reactors and the fermented rice flour and brown sugar beginning from day 14 confirmed the effectiveness of fermented rice flour in producing lactic acid bacteria for FS sanitization.<fig id="fig2a"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2a</label><caption><p>Lactic acid bacteria cell count in the reactors during the overall treatment process.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig.&#x000a0;2a</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="egi10ZGJ8Z1Z7G"/></fig><fig id="fig2b"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2b</label><caption><p>Lactic acid bacterial cell count on LAB agar plate 10<sup>6</sup> (A&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;LAB in fermented rice flour, B&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;LAB in 1:1 reactor, C&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;LAB in 2:1 reactor).</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0025">Fig.&#x000a0;2b</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="egi10KT0B9367L"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Acidification of fecal sludge and pH reduction</title><p id="p0110"><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> depicts the pH of the sanitization process. In the LAF experiments, the pH was monitored using two test reactors and a control reactor. The initial pH was 7.6 in the control reactor and 6.6&#x02013;6.8 in the test reactors. The lower pH in the test reactors was due to the addition of lactic acid produced from rice flour and brown sugar, which has a pH of 3.5. For the reactor containing 1:1 of FS and fermented rice flour and brown sugar and that containing 2:1 of FS and fermented rice flour and brown sugar, the pH rapidly declined in the first seven days and remained nearly constant from day 10 to the final day of the experiment The increase in and stability of the LAB in the treatment process resulted in a rapid pH drop during the experiment.

According to <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Thimann (1963)</xref>, lactic acid fermentation must have a final pH of 4.0 to be effective in sanitization. However, in addition to pH reduction, other antimicrobial compounds, such as hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and diacetyl, are produced by LAB during the fermentation process, and these compounds induce an additional hygienization effect in the fermentation system. The final low pH recorded in this study was considered to have provided the desired hygienization and odor reduction effects. Observation of the pH profile in the LAF of the FS revealed that sugar addition is needed to reduce the pH such that an efficient LAF process can be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><label>3.4</label><title>Fecal coliform inactivation</title><p id="p0120">In assessing the efficiency of the treatment of FS, measuring different pathogens is a labor-intensive and costly strategy (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Strande et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

The technology was considerably effective in completely eliminating fecal coliforms within a short period of time, implying that the process was feasible and had a low reactor footprint and short retention time. Furthermore, the LAF technology had a relatively lower energy requirement than those of other conventional options, such as anaerobic digestion, microwave application, composting, liquid fuel, and dry fuel. Thus, in view of its potential for large-scale applications, this technology can be relevant in emergency situations, such as refugee camps, where the population and the FS generation are very high. The improvement of the food supply through agriculture by using sanitized FS as soil conditioner in emergency situations will be a welcome development. However, direct application of lacto-fermented feces to agriculture may be constrained by incomplete decomposition, high concentrations of organic acids or insufficient hygienization. Post-treatment by adding biochar, vermi-composting, or thermophilic composting stabilizes and sanitizes the material before its application for soil amendment.</p><p id="p0145">This study validated the LAF application for the sanitization of FS under the tested method and laid the foundation for scaling up the method by assessing its energy consumption, process efficiency, and performance. When designing a large-scale LAF of FS technology for practical field application, food waste with LAF potential can be used to replace rice flour. One-third of the food produced globally for human consumption (approximately 1.3 billion tons) is lost. Developing and industrialized countries waste nearly the same amount of food (630 and 670 million tons annually, respectively) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">News, 2011</xref>). Using part of these wastes for the LAF of FS will be an economic advantage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0150">In this study, FS treatment technology was evaluated using fresh FS collected from a toilet septic tank. This study demonstrated for the first time that the combination of fermented rice flour and brown sugar could be applied for the quick treatment of FS to reduce its pathogens and odor content before further treatment for soil amendment. The LAF of FS with fermented rice flour and brown sugar can be potentially applied as a low-cost and simple technique for effectively eliminating pathogens and odor emissions in FS. The addition of lactic acid produced from fermented rice flour and brown sugar led to an effective acidification of the process to pH of 3.51&#x02013;3.52 and fecal coliform inactivation while maintaining high concentrations of LAB during the treatment process. The trends in the LAB composition in the FS during the treatment process revealed that LAB remained stable in the reactors, thereby enhancing the suppression of the fecal coliforms. From an economic perspective, this process could enable the storage of portions of the FS from the treatment reactor for a similar sanitization process, thereby reducing the need to purchase expensive LAB for the acidification process in the FS treatment. The results suggested that the FS treatment using fermented rice flour and brown sugar is feasible. Further investigations are needed to validate the use of food wastes to replace rice flour when considering large-scale applications and the efficiency of food waste as a LAF process for sanitizing other bacterial pathogens in FS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adamtey</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cofie</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ofosu-Budu</surname><given-names>G.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Danso</surname><given-names>S.K.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Forster</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Production and storage of N-enriched co-compost</article-title><source>Waste Manag.</source><volume>29</volume><issue>9</issue><year>2009</year><fpage>2429</fpage><lpage>2436</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19523800</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>al-Ghazali</surname><given-names>M.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>al-Azawi</surname><given-names>S.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Listeria monocytogenes contamination of crops grown on soil treated with sewage sludge cake</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Appl.
