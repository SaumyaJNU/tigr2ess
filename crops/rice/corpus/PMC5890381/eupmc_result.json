    "Providing safe fecal sludge (FS) sanitation has remained an important goal of global communities because of the high risks imposed on human health of the exposure to un-sanitized FS. This study used lactic acid fermentation as a pre-treatment technology to evaluate the sanitization effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on FS. A combination of fermented rice flour and brown sugar was used as the medium to prepare LAB, and fecal coliforms were used as the indicator organisms. The addition of a LAB suspension grown in fermented rice flour and brown sugar to FS was studied to evaluate the survival of fecal coliforms. The pH decreased during ongoing lactic acid fermentation after the addition of the LAB suspension. The results revealed that fecal coliforms in reactors containing 1:1 and 2:1 w/w of FS and LAB suspension decreased to half of the initial concentration within seven days of the treatment process in comparison with that of the control reactor. Viable plate counts of 0.6 × 108, 0.9 × 108, and 2.4 × 108 CFU/100 mL were recorded from reactors 1:1, 2:1, and the control, respectively. The total elimination of the fecal coliforms below the detection limit (<3 log 10 CFU/100 mL) was observed in both reactors after 15-17 days, whereas the number of fecal coliforms remained at 2.3 × 108 CFU/100 mL in the control reactor. The fecal coliforms were eliminated because of the acidification caused by the LAB during the incubation time. The final pH in the treatment reactors 1:1 and 2:1 was 3.7 and 3.9. While the final pH in the control reactor was 7.91. The results revealed that the bacterial pathogens in FS can be completely eliminated through a low-cost technique and a simple lactic acid fermentation process."
