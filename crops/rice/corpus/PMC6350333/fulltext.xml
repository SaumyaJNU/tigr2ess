To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rice bakanae disease resistance, we employed a 6-plex tandem mass tag approach for relative quantitative proteomic comparison of infected and uninfected rice seedlings 7&#x02009;days post-inoculation with two genotypes: the resistant genotype 93&#x02013;11 and the susceptible genotype Nipponbare.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In total, 123 (77.2% up-regulated, 22.8% down-regulated) and 91 (94.5% up-regulated, 5.5% down-regulated) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) accumulated in 93&#x02013;11 and Nipponbare, respectively. Only 11 DEPs were both shared by the two genotypes. Clustering results showed that the protein regulation trends for the two genotypes were highly contrasting, which suggested obviously different interaction mechanisms of the host and the pathogen between 93 and 11 and Nipponbare. Further analysis showed that a noticeable aquaporin, PIP2&#x02013;2, was sharply upregulated with a fold change (FC) of 109.2 in 93&#x02013;11, which might be related to pathogen defense and the execution of bakanae disease resistance. Certain antifungal proteins were regulated in both 93&#x02013;11 and Nipponbare with moderate FCs. These proteins might participate in protecting the cellular integrity required for basic growth of the susceptible genotype.

In China, rice is a staple food crop that feeds more than 60% of the population and contributes nearly 40% of the total calorie intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Under diverse ecological conditions, rice is frequently exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among biotic stresses, many diseases play an important role in determining the yield and cost of food. Rice bakanae disease, caused by the fungus <italic>Fusarium fujikuroi</italic>, is an important disease in rice. That can be soilborne or seedborne and results in characteristic symptoms of excessively elongated seedlings with chlorotic stems and leaves. Bakanae disease occurs widely throughout Asia and Europe, and sporadically in other areas of rice production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent changes in climate and in cropping patterns have aggravated the disease. Although bakanae disease can be managed to a certain extent using chemical fungicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] through seed treatment and soil amendment, a more efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly solution is to explore genetic resources that are resistant to the disease and breed additional high-resistance genotypes.</p><p id="Par16">Several studies have made progress in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing resistance against bakanae in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] first obtained two QTLs, <italic>qB1</italic> and <italic>qB10</italic>, associated with more than 13% of expressed variance for resistance to bakanae disease, via artificial inoculation at the seedling stage using a <italic>japonica</italic>/<italic>indica</italic> double haploid (DH) population derived from Chunjiang 06 and TN1. Hur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] reported a major QTL for bakanae disease resistance, <italic>qBK1</italic>, which explained 65% of the total phenotypic variation in near-isogenic lines (NILs) obtained from a cross between the resistant donor YR24982&#x02013;9-1 and the susceptible parent Ilpum. Fiyaz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] identified three QTLs (<italic>qBK1.1</italic>, <italic>qBK1.2</italic> and <italic>qBK1.3</italic>, which accounted for 4.76, 24.74 and 6.49% of phenotypic variation, respectively) using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the <italic>indica</italic> rice parents Pusa 1342 and Pusa Basmati 1121. <italic>qBK1.1</italic> is likely the same as <italic>qBK1</italic> identified by Hur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but the associated phenotypic variations were extremely different because different mapping populations were used; thus, these QTLs are far from application in marker-assisted introgression of bakanae resistance in rice breeding. Recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] using a GWAS approach to screen a <italic>japonica</italic> rice germplasm collection revealed two new genomic regions that were highly associated with the observed phenotypic variation for the response to bakanae infection on the short arm of chromosome 1 (designated qBK1_628091) and the long arm of chromosome 4 (designated qBK4_31750955), representing new genomic regions associated with <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> resistance.</p><p id="Par17">In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to illustrate the molecular mechanism of the interaction between <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> and rice plants. Different expression patterns were identified for the resistant genotype 93&#x02013;11 and the susceptible genotype Nipponbare through comparative transcriptome analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The results revealed that certain WRKYs, WAK and MAP3Ks were responsible for the bakanae disease resistance of 93-11and showed that the defense-related genes (WRKYs and MARKs) on chromosome 1 that are modulated in 93&#x02013;11 upon infection might play a crucial role in the rice-<italic>F. fujikuroi</italic> interaction. Mati&#x00107; S et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] found that PR1, germin-like proteins, glycoside hydrolases, MAP kinases, and WRKY transcriptional factors were up-regulated in the resistant genotype Selenio upon infection with <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>, whereas up-regulation of chitinases and down-regulation of MAP kinases and WRKY transcription factors were found in the susceptible cultivar Dorell. Pathways including the response to chitin, JA-dependent signalling and the hypersensitive response were found to be involved in bakanae resistance.</p><p id="Par18">In addition to QTL mapping and transcriptome analysis of rice bakanae disease resistance, other technologies and methods are needed to further dissect resistance to bakanae disease. With the completion of rice genome sequencing in 2002, proteomics is becoming an increasingly powerful tool for the investigation of complex cellular processes and has also been successfully used for genetic and physiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Proteomic technology is also playing a key role in developing an inventory of proteins that are responsive to biotic and abiotic stresses and in dissecting rice defense pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In rice breeding, proteomics is usually applied to detect stress-responsive proteins through comparisons among stressed plants. Further identification of candidate proteins may reveal that some of these proteins have functions that are clearly consistent with the stress-tolerance trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">A comparative proteomics study of rice genotypes that are resistant and susceptible to bakanae disease has yet not to be reported, nor has the correlation between the proteome and transcriptome under disease stress. In this study, the tandem mass tag (TMT) technique was applied to compare the differences in the proteomic pattern associated with the bakanae disease response using the resistant genotype 93&#x02013;11 and the susceptible genotype Nipponbare. On the basis of our previous study of the disease response at different transcriptome levels between the two genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], correlation analysis was conducted between proteomic data and the transcriptomic data. The molecular mechanism of rice resistance to bakanae disease was thereby comprehensively dissected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Responses of 93&#x02013;11 and Nipponbare after inoculation with F.

It has been reported that AQP responds to various stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], including the overexpression of <italic>TaAQP8</italic> in tobacco to increase tolerance to salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], overexpression of <italic>RWC3</italic> in rice to increase tolerance to drought stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and overexpression of BnPIP1 in tobacco to increase tolerance to water stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] suggested that aquaporin proteins might improve plant abiotic resistance through alleviating water deficit or oxidative damage. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AQP was shown to be involved in responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that vacuolar trafficking mediated by vacuolar sorting receptor1 (VSR1) is required for osmotic stress-responsive ABA biosynthesis and osmotic stress tolerance. In this study, a vacuolar-sorting receptor 3(VSR3) was significantly up-regulated, with an FC of 16.01 in 93&#x02013;11, which meant that the vacuolar-sorting protein VSR3 could improve resistance to bakanae to some extent.</p><p id="Par28">According to the the susceptible genotype Nipponbare, the FCs of the genes encoding the aquaporin and VSR3 proteins were around 1 (data in the Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), which meant that no obvious change was demonstrated for the proteins between the treatment and the control plants in the susceptible genotype.</p><p id="Par29">Plants have developed various mechanisms, including the production of antifungal proteins or resistance-related proteins to defend themselves against pathogenic fungi. In this study, antifungal proteins such as defensin, peroxidase and ribonuclease were regulated in both 93&#x02013;11 and Nipponbare, although the FCs of these proteins were only moderately high. Furthermore, although Nipponbare was susceptible to bakanae disease, the corresponding gene encoding the beta-fructofuranosidase protein LOC4335790, also known as CIN2/GIF1, was up-regulated with an FC of 11.58.

Yuan et al.

Olivares-Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that most of the variability in the protein-transcript relationship can be explained by the variation in the codon composition, and codon usage variability therefore determines the correlation between proteome and transcriptome FCs.

Further research is requisite to dissect the intriguing result.</p><p id="Par34">Some arguments regarding this aspect have been put forth.

Certain opposite change trends were demonstrated between the two omics levels. The regulation of the process leading from mRNA to protein is generally very complex. During protein translation from mRNA, factors including mRNA splicing, altered protein turnover, protein degradation, or a combination of the above may lead to a poor correlation between the expression patterns of mRNAs and their respective proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Komatsu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] maintained that transcript and protein levels cannot be correlated, due to the inability of total mRNA to be translated into protein.

In this study, TMT-based experiments were performed to identify proteins that were differentially accumulated between <italic>F. fujikuroi</italic>-infected and mock-inoculated seedlings of the bakanae disease-resistant and -susceptible genotypes 93-11and Nipponbare, respectively, to determine the key proteins involved in disease defense. The results revealed that the greatly up-regulated protein PIP2&#x02013;2 might be related to pathogen defense and the execution of bakanae disease resistance. The vacuolar-sorting protein VSR3 can improve resistance to bakanae to some extent. Certain antifungal proteins were regulated in both the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Correlation analysis of transcriptome and proteome levels revealed a significant positive correlation only in the resistant genotype, while no such correlation was found in the susceptible genotype, which could be explained by the differences in codon usage. Overall, the molecular regulation of rice bakanae disease resistance was found to be completely different between 93-11and Nipponbare. Functional verification of the key protein PIP2&#x02013;2 will be a prerequisite of our future research, which may be accomplished through transferring the related gene to the susceptible genotype or knocking down the gene in the resistant genotype.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Plant materials and inoculation with <italic>F.
