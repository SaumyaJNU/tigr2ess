The high-dose/refuge and pyramid (gene stacking) strategy are commonly employed to delay the evolution of insect resistance. Due to the anticipated difficulty for deployment of mandatory refuge for transgenic crops in China, where the size of farmer is quite small, stacking of genes with different modes of action is a more feasible strategy. Here we report the development of transgenic rice expressing a fusion protein of Cry1Ab and Vip3A toxin. Analysis of trypsin proteolysis suggested that the fusion protein is equivalent to the combination of Cry1Ab and Vip3A protein. The transgenic plants expressing the fusion protein were found to be highly resistant to two major rice pests, Asiatic rice borer <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and rice leaf folder <italic>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</italic> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), while their agronomic performances showed no significant difference compared to the non-transgenic recipient rice. Therefore, the transgenic rice may be utilized for rice pest control in China.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004573</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Agriculture of the People&#x00026;apos;s Republic of China (Ministry of Agriculture)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08010003</award-id><award-id>2016ZX08010003</award-id><award-id>2016ZX08010003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Jiahui</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (Bt) was a ubiquitous gram-positive and sporulating bacterium that produces various insecticidal proteins. Crops have been engineered to express Bt insecticidal toxins for controlling insect pest species of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Bt toxins have no significant risk to the environment or to human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Two sorts of insect specific toxins produced by Bt have been commercialized in agriculture, which are insecticidal crystal protein (Cry)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and vegetative insecticidal protein (Vip)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Most of Cry proteins are produced in parasporal crystals during sporulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. To date, more than 800 Cry proteins were identified and some of them were developed commercially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Vip toxins are produced during the vegetative growth stage of Bt and share no nucleotide sequence similarity to Cry proteins. Vip3A is a Vip3 toxin that is highly active to lepidopteran insects and has a totally different mode of action with Cry toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Several Bt genes like <italic>cry1Ab/1Ac</italic>, <italic>cry2A</italic> and <italic>cry1F</italic>, and <italic>vip3Aa19</italic> are successfully engineered to generate commercial Bt transgenic events for pest control, such as Mon810, Bt11 and MIR162<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Nevertheless, due to the long-term application, field-evolved insect resistance to Bt toxins has become a serious threat to the continued utilization of Bt crops and diminished their benefits in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A major corn pest, fall armyworm (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>), was reported evolved resistance on TC1507 maize in Puerto Rico since 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In Brazil, transgenic maize producing Bt toxin Cry1F started to be commercialized since 2008 and was found damage caused by fall armyworm in 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Cotton bollworm (<italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>) and pink bollworm (<italic>Pectinophora gossypiella</italic>) evolved resistance on transgenic cotton expressing Cry1Ac in China during the last 10 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These lessons asked for improved strategy for insect resistance management. Currently, two strategies are generally considered to delay the resistance evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. One is the refuge strategy, which is the primary approach in insect resistance management and proven effectiveness worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, it is a challenge in China and other developing countries due to their small farm size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The other prevalent approach is the pyramiding (gene stacking) strategy that pyramids two or more Bt toxins killing the same insect pest. The assumption underlying this strategy is that the toxins have different modes of action and would not cause cross-resistance. Pyramided Bt crops producing two or more toxins have been rapidly replaced single-toxin Bt crops in some area, such as transgenic cotton in Australia and the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In China, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is the staple food for most people. Although transgenic rice had not been commercially planted in China, researches on Bt transgenic rice has lasted for over 20 years. The transgenic line KMD1 expressing a synthetic <italic>cry1Ab</italic> gene was highly resistant to eight lepidopteran rice pest species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another case was Bt shanyou-63 containing a chimeric <italic>cry1Ab/cry1Ac</italic> gene, which showed high protection against rice leaffolder and yellow stem borer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. All these lines were single-toxin Bt events. To date, there is still no report on Bt transgenic rice expressing single Vip3A toxin. As to the high probability of insect resistance, tactics for pest management must be updated. Considering the breeding pattern of rice in China, the exploration on transgenic rice lines fusing two or more toxins seems to be a more convenient method for insect resistance management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here we reported the development of a transgenic rice line expressing a fusion protein of Cry1Ab and Vip3A. The truncated and active <italic>cry1Ab</italic> gene, encoding N-terminal 651 amino acid residues of Cry1Ab, was fused in reading frame to the 5&#x02032; end of the synthetic <italic>vip3A</italic> gene encoding 790 amino acid residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Proteolysis of the fusion protein by trypsin suggested that it would have an equivalent activity with individual Cry1Ab and Vip3A toxin in insect midgut. Bioassay results on transgenic events revealed that the selected event A1L3 had strong insecticidal activities against two major rice pests in China, Asiatic rice borer <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and rice leaf folder <italic>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</italic> (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Moreover, the insect resistance trait of A1L3 was found to be stable among plants of different generations. Thus, the transgenic line A1L3 could be a good candidate for rice pest control in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fusion protein expression and its insecticidal activity</title><p id="Par6">The truncated <italic>cry1Ab</italic> and the full-length <italic>vip3A</italic> gene were fused by a 24 base-pair nucleotide linker in reading frame to generate <italic>C1V3</italic> gene.

The result showed that the C1V3 protein was expressed at high level as inclusion body. The molecular weight of expressed C1V3 was about 160-kDa as expected. When digested with trypsin, active Cry1Ab and Vip3A protein generated trypsin-resistant core of about 60-kDa and 65-kDa in size, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These trypsin-resistant cores are the hallmark of active Bt toxins. A commercial trypsin and the insect midgut juice was prepared to investigate if C1V3 protein retained these trypsin-resistant cores, and then Western blot analysis was performed with Cry1Ab and Vip3A polyclonal antiserum respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We found that C1V3 protein did generate a ~60-kDa Cry1Ab and a ~65-kDa Vip3A trypsin-resistant core, exactly same as individual Cry1Ab and Vip3A were digested by trypsin and insect midgut juice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, once the fusion protein is ingested by insects, it could be processed to activated cores and works like a combination of two individual proteins of Cry1Ab and Vip3A.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of recombinant insecticidal protein expressed by <italic>E. coli.</italic> Cry1Ab, Vip3A and C1V3 were all expressed by <italic>E. coli</italic> using pET28a vector.

In this study, we developed a fusion strategy to express two Bt insecticidal toxins with different modes of action in transgenic rice simultaneously. A fusion gene of <italic>cry1Ab/vip3A</italic> with linker was utilized. Our study suggested that the fusion protein can be reconstituted into two individual toxins upon trypsin digestion. Western blot analysis revealed that C1V3 could be digested into a ~60-kDa Cry1Ab product and a ~65-kDa Vip3A product respectively, which were identical to that of the individual protein of Cry1Ab and Vip3A. The digested products by commercial trypsin and Asiatic rice borer midgut extraction indicated that C1V3 protein could successfully be activated <italic>in vivo</italic>. These trypsin-generated products were the hallmark of activated Bt toxins. Therefore, we suggested that C1V3 protein could be successfully activated and work equivalently to individual Cry1Ab and Vip3A. Expressing fusion protein has some advantages over expressing individual proteins. The fusion method equalizes the expression level of the two proteins, and also is more convenient in trait integration into different crop elite lines as no stacking is required.</p><p id="Par14">The transgenic rice event A1L3 was selected for possible commercial development after a comprehensive evaluation of about a hundred events on insertion sites, expression levels, insect bioassay and agronomic traits. Nearly 40 events of the T0 transgenic events were discarded due to the low expression level of C1V3 (less than 4.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per gram of fresh leaf weight). The C1V3 expression level of the left events was determined at the range of 4.0~28.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g-fwt. Integration of T-DNA in rice genome and bioassay on insects would be considered for events selection. Only four events were kept for further evaluation because their T-DNA didn&#x02019;t integrate into any annotated loci of rice genome and the T-DNA copy number was single. A1L3 was not the highest expressers but it already demonstrated high resistance to the two major rice pests, <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> and <italic>C. medinalis</italic>. We believe that the expression level in A1L3 is high enough to control the target pests effectively. The amount of the insecticidal protein C1V3 in A1L3 was almost triple of the chimeric Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac protein expressed in previously reported transgenic events Bt Huahui-1, in which the Bt protein was determined at 1.88~2.36&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/g fresh leaf weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We did not observe any negative effects on agronomic performances or on disease resistance in A1L3 for two consecutive years planting in fields. However, we observed in two seasons that the events with significant higher expression of C1V3 appeared to have more disease spots on leaves. We will continue our study to check if there is any relationship between the expression levels of C1V3 and the disease spots in their leaves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fusion gene assembling</title><p id="Par15">The coding sequences of <italic>cry1Ab</italic> and <italic>vip3A</italic> gene were both optimized according to the codon bias of monocots and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
