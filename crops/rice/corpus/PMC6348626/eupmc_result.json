    "BACKGROUND:As important female reproductive tissues, the rice (Oryza sativa L.) ovule and female gametophyte is significant in terms of their fertility. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important and wide-ranging roles in the growth and development of plants and have become a major research focus in recent years. Therefore, we explored the characterization and expression change of lncRNAs during ovule development and female gametophytic abortion. RESULTS:In our study, whole-transcriptome strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) was performed in the ovules of a high-frequency female-sterile rice line (fsv1) and a wild-type rice line (Gui99) at the megaspore mother cell meiosis stage (stage 1), functional megaspore mitosis stage (stage 2) and female gametophyte mature stage (stage 3). By comparing two rice lines, we identified 152, 233, and 197 differentially expressed lncRNAs at the three ovule developmental stages. Functional analysis of the coherent target genes of these differentially expressed lncRNAs indicated that many lncRNAs participate in multiple pathways such as hormone and cellular metabolism and signal transduction. Moreover, there were many differentially expressed lncRNAs acting as the precursors of some miRNAs that are involved in the development of ovules and female gametophytes. In addition, we have found that lncRNAs can act as decoys, competing with mRNAs for binding to miRNAs to maintain the normal expression of genes related to ovule and female gametophyte development. CONCLUSION:These results provide important clues for elucidating the female gametophyte abortion mechanism in rice. This study also expands our understanding about the biological functions of lncRNAs and the annotation of the rice genome."
