The household survey was implemented using a structured questionnaire administered among 1028 households in the main rice production areas of Ecuador (i.e. Guayas, Los Rios, Manabi, and El Oro provinces). Information collected was provided by household heads (male or female) and included household and plot level data. The survey information includes household socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, education, gender, main economic activity, etc.), farm characteristics (e.g. farm land size, assets ownership, other crops planted, etc.), rice management practices (e.g. variety and input use, production costs, etc.), and rice production and utilization (e.g. yields, prices, sales, etc.). Additional socio-economic context variables were also recorded such as government subsidies to rice production, participation in rural organizations, and food security related questions. The dataset contains a total of 6288 variables among numeric, categorical and string variables. The dataset is shared publicly on the Harvard dataverse site and provide access to questionnaires, the complete data and a brief report.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><bold>Specifications table</bold><table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><alt-text id="at0015">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td>Agricultural sciences</td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td>Adoption of improved rice varieties and management practices</td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td>Categorical, string and numeric variables</td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td>Household surveys through face to face interviews</td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td>STATA (dta) files and CSV files in raw format</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td>Sample consisted of 1028 rice growers selected randomly in main rice production areas in Ecuador in a cross-sectional survey</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td>Factors that facilitate or limit the adoption of rice innovations</td></tr><tr><td>Data source location</td><td>84 farm communities distributed in Guayas, Los Rios, Manabi, and El Oro provinces of Ecuador</td></tr><tr><td>Data accessibility</td><td>The data accompanying this article can be found online at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DX3F4T" id="ir0005">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DX3F4T</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0010"><bold>Value of the data</bold><list list-type="simple" id="li0005"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">The dataset with detailed plot level information can be used to characterize rice farming systems in Ecuador and parametrize and develop rice crop models to evaluate biotic and abiotic effects on production.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">The dataset can be used to estimate the level of adoption of different rice varieties and agronomic practices in Ecuador, and analyze factors influencing adoption of agricultural innovations in the rice sector.

The sample frame represented 97% of total rice production in the country. In the first stage a total of 84 farm communities were selected randomly using rice area planted at province and canton<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> levels to build an associated probability of each community of being selected <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In the second stage twelve rice producers were randomly selected within each community. Given the interest to understand the role of gender into rice production in Ecuador, the sampling design aimed to interview at least three female heads in each community. Nevertheless, due to the cultural context of the Ecuadorian rural areas, it was only possible to interview female headed households in 7.2 percent of the total sample. The dataset was collected using paper questionnaires. Field work was carried by four teams of three enumerators and a coordinator with multiple backgrounds (i.e. agronomy, sociology and economics). Data was entered and verified using CSPro (Census and Survey Processing System) before being exported to Stata 13.1 and CSV (Comma-Separated Values<italic>)</italic> formats.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yamano</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Arouna</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Labarta</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Huelgas</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohanty</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Adoption and impacts of international rice research technologies</article-title><source>Glob.
