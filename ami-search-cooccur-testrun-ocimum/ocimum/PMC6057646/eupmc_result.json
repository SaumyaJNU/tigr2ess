    "The seed coat mucilage envelope is formed just after hydration and surrounds the seed as a gel-like, transparent capsule. The mucilage envelope represents a special type of modified cell wall with all of the typical polysaccharides i.e. cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses. The chemical composition of the mucilage is well-recognized but its structural organization remains unclear. In the presented study, we visualized the spatial architecture of the seed mucilage envelope of selected taxa which produce cellulose mucilage. Using critical point drying (CPD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, we demonstrated the structural details of the mucilage from the micro- down to the nanoscale. The mucilage, after CPD, had a visibly spatial structure which differed between the studied taxa; for example, a tangled organization in Arabidopsis thaliana and a more ordered arrangement in Ocimum basilicum were revealed. In general, the mucilaginous fibrillary components formed network made of long, unbranched, thicker cellulose fibrils together with shorter, thinner and, often branched other polysaccharides. Cellulose fibrils built a kind of scaffold for the rest of the components which were spread between them and/or covered their surface. The cellulose fibrils were attached to the seed surface, and therefore prevent the loss of the mucilage envelope during mechanical impacts. The loose architecture and special chemical composition of the mucilaginous cell wall is important for water binding and storage, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the seed mucilage envelope."
