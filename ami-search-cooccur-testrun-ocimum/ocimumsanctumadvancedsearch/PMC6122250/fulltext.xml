cell generate structural changes in water. This interfacial water is ordered and
acquires features different from the bulk. Amongst those features is the
exclusion of colloidal and molecular solutes from extensive regions next to the
hydrophilic surface, thereby earning it the label of &#x0201c;exclusion zone&#x0201d; (EZ)
water. The transition of ordered EZ water to bulk serves as an important trigger
of many cellular physiological functions, and in turn cellular health. We tested
physiological doses of half a dozen agents generally identified to restore or
build health on the extent to which they build EZs. All agents known to enhance
biological function resulted in EZ expansion. On the other hand, the weed
killer, glyphosate, considerably diminished EZ size. While the expansion effect
of the health-promoting agents was observed over a wide range of concentrations,
excessive doses ultimately reduced EZ size. We hypothesize that EZ buildup may
be a mechanistic feature underlying many health-promoting agents, while agents
that impair health may act by diminishing the amount of EZ water.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exclusion zone water</kwd><kwd>hydrophilic surface</kwd><kwd>dose dependent</kwd><kwd>health-promoting agents</kwd><kwd>nutraceuticals</kwd><kwd>dose response</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1559325818796937"><funding-source id="funding1-1559325818796937"><institution-wrap><institution>SAGST Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July-September 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1559325818796937"><title>Introduction</title><p>Earlier studies have revealed the extensive presence of ordered, interfacial water

hydrophilic surfaces including those inside the cell. Interfacial, ordered water has
been given the name &#x0201c;exclusion zone&#x0201d; (EZ) or &#x0201c;fourth phase&#x0201d; water.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>The central role of water in cell function has been known since the time of
Szent-Gyorgyi, the father of modern biochemistry. Among Szent-Gyorgyi&#x02019;s famous
quotes, a relevant one is &#x0201c;Life is water dancing to the tune of solids.&#x0201d; This
aphorism was given additional substance with evidence that the transition from
ordered (now called &#x0201c;EZ&#x0201d;) water to bulk water was an important trigger of many
physiological actions, and that without that water, the cell could not properly function.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>The critical role of EZ water in cell function has led to the hypothesis that any
deficiency in EZ water will impair cellular function and therefore impair health.
Conversely, rebuilding of EZ water in EZ-deficient situations ought to return health
toward normal.</p><p>We tested that hypothesis by using agents generally acknowledged to promote or
restore health. Physiological doses of nutraceuticals such as tulsi (holy basil),
Culturelle (Cromwell, CT) kids probiotics, turmeric, and coconut water as well as
commonly used pain-relieving medications such as aspirin and Tylenol were tested for
their ability to build or diminish EZ water. A weed killer, Roundup that contains
glyphosate as its main ingredient and is well-known to adversely affect health, was
also tested to see if its effects are opposite.</p><p>To test for the quantity of EZ water, we used a preparation that has become standard.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It involves the polymer, Nafion, which nucleates a sizeable EZ, the extent of
which is defined by the exclusion of microspheres. By varying the concentration of
the respective agents in question, we could assess the extent to which the agent
increased or decreased EZ size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1559325818796937"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-1559325818796937"><title>Exclusion Zone Nucleating Surface</title><p>Nafion tubing was obtained from PermaPure LLC (Lakewood, NJ).

microspheres, polycarboxylate-coated 0.5, 1, or 2 &#x003bc;m (Polysciences Inc; # 18327;
2.5% solids-latex), and polystyrene-coated 1 &#x003bc;m (Polysciences Inc; # 19814; 2.5%
solids-latex, Warrington, PA). The microspheres were suspended in deionized (DI)
water obtained from a Barnstead D3750 Nanopure Diamond purification system,
Dubuque, IA) (type 1 high-performance liquid chromatography grade, 18.2 M&#x003a9;). The
volume ratio of microsphere to DI water was between 1:100 and 1:1000 depending
on the kind of experiment performed, and kept constant during each experimental
series to eliminate any effects that might arise from concentration
differences.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1559325818796937"><title>Measurements of EZ</title><p>The cut piece of Nafion tubing was typically held by a pair of tweezers, while a
prepared microsphere solution in a syringe was injected inside the tube until no
air bubbles were present. The Nafion tubing was then manipulated with the
tweezers so that it was well-submerged in a 35 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm Falcon polystyrene
petri dish containing 3 to 4 mL of the prepared microsphere suspension.
Occasionally, the cut piece of Nafion tubing was hydrated by submerging it first
in a 35 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm Falcon polystyrene petri dish containing 3 to 4 mL DI water
for 15 to 30 minutes before starting the experiment. For control EZ
measurements, the hydrated tubing was removed and placed in a fresh petri dish
with 3 to 4 mL DI water containing microspheres. For experimental measurements,
another segment of Nafion tubing was placed in 3 to 4 mL of the suspension to be
tested (experimental). The petri dish with the submerged Nafion tubing oriented
normal to the optical axis was covered and placed on the stage of a Zeiss
(Thornwood, NY) Axiovert 35 microscope equipped with a 2.5&#x000d7; objective lens
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1559325818796937">Figure 1 C</xref>).
Amscope software (Version: x64, 3.1.615), downloaded onto the computer, was set
on auto-image to capture an image of the EZ forming against the Nafion tubing.
All measurements of EZ were taken when a steady-state EZ size was attained, ie,
&#x0223c;15 minutes after tubing and suspension were combined. In some cases, the time
period was extended to 30 minutes. The graph tool from the Image-J (version,
1.49v) program was used to make 2 to 6 measurements of EZ size on each side of
the Nafion tubing, from which the mean EZ size was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1559325818796937"><title>Measurements of EZ in the Presence of Functional Agents</title><p>We tested diverse functional agents, for example, holy basil, turmeric,

conventional biochemical and other methods. Aspirin and Tylenol, analgesic
substances in effective use for pharmaceutical purposes were also added to the
list. We expected each of these agents to enhance EZ formation, while Roundup
was expected to diminish EZ. Each agent was tested at various concentrations
ranging above and below the anticipated concentrations in the human body; the
latter based on substance weight or volume and the approximate weight/volume of

health-promoting agents could lie in buildup of EZ water within the cells, thus
influencing general health, for water is everywhere. The results show that this is
indeed the case with a selection of nutraceuticals and pain-relieving medications
undertaken for the study that build EZ water over a sizable range of concentrations.
By contrast, the weed killer, Roundup, whose active ingredient is glyphosate, failed
to show any EZ expansion; instead, EZ diminished steadily with increasing
concentration.</p><p>With regard to the proposed hypothesis, several questions arise. One is whether the
substances tested are necessarily health-promoting. Another is whether the
concentrations over which the EZ expands correspond to the concentrations that one
might anticipate in vivo. Once the substance is ingested, concentrations begin
building; hence, the smallest concentrations must be relevant. Evaluating the extent
to which higher concentrations are relevant is less simple, for substances are
absorbed, metabolized, nonuniformly distributed, excreted, and so on. The entire
field of pharmacokinetics addresses these questions, and not all answers are secure.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, some rough estimates can be made.</p><p>Holy basil, also known as Tulsi, comes from the herb known as <italic>Ocimum
Tenuiflorum</italic> or <italic>Ocimum Sanctum.</italic> It is an Ayurvedic
medicinal plant, traditionally used for general health and a long life.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr11-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We used the liquid extract of Tulsi, prepared from the leaves of <italic>O
tenuiflorum</italic> and <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> plants with a
suggested serving size of 0.7 mL to 2 ozs (about 60 mL) of water. This would roughly
translate to 0.5 &#x000b5;L in a typical human body with 40 L of water and is equal to the
area between the concentrations of &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;5 (log [v/v]) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1559325818796937">Figure 2</xref>. Exclusion zone was observed to be
the highest at these concentrations.</p><p>The most clinically studied probiotic, Culturelle kids probiotic, is free from dairy,
gluten, and sugar, and helps to restore the balance of good and not-so-good bacteria
in children&#x02019;s digestive systems.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Probiotic packets are recommended to be taken in servings of 1 gram. In an
average human body with 40 L of water, this translates to 1 mg/40 mL (0.0025 g/100
mL). Exclusion zone increased steadily in the presence of this probiotic and
plateaued out at 0.125 g/100 mL. Higher concentrations decreased EZ; however, even
the highest concentration of 100 times more than the recommended amount (1 mg/40 mL)
elicited a larger EZ than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1559325818796937">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that even very large
concentrations of probiotics can have an EZ-amplifying effect.</p><p>Coconut water is very rich in potassium and contains sodium, chloride, and carbohydrate.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Used as a rehydration fluid,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> it is also reported to have antioxidant properties.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The usual amount of coconut water consumed by a human being at one time is
about 11 ounces (325 mL). This would amount to 0.8% when calculated based on a
typical human with 40 L of water. We obtained a good-sized EZ at concentrations of
coconut water lower than 0.5% to 1% (&#x02212;2.3 to &#x02212;2 on the log concentration axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1559325818796937">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also studied turmeric, which is a bright yellow &#x0201c;golden spice for all seasons&#x0201d;
used in daily cooking in most Indian households. Derived from the rhizome of
<italic>C longa</italic>, it is also valued as an herbal medicinal product and
is a potential candidate for the prevention and/or treatment of many diseases due to
its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Normal dosage lies within the 0.5 g range, which translates to 0.0125 g/L in
a typical human body containing 40 L of water. While data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1559325818796937">Figure 5</xref> do not represent the
effect of turmeric at concentrations lower than 0.02 g/L, it does indicate that
concentrations as high as 0.1 g/L may be safely used to elicit a good-sized EZ.</p><p>Prompted by the popular saying, &#x0201c;An aspirin a day, keeps the doctor away,&#x0201d; we studied
one of the most widely used drugs worldwide over the past 2
centuries&#x02014;acetylsalicylic acid,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> for testing the growth of EZ in its presence. Touted for its many health
benefits, aspirin can reduce pain, fever, swelling, and inflammation, and prevent
heart attack, stroke, and even certain cancers.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> There is also evidence to show that aspirin may play a role in fighting
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, Huntington disease, and
mood disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We carried out experiments with a typical aspirin tablet that contained 325
mg of acetylsalicylic acid. Thus, in a typical human body with 40 L of water, we
estimated a typical dosage of 45 &#x000b5;M aspirin, which was comparable to data obtained
in earlier reports with minor modifications in experimental details.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The other concentrations tested were based off this typical dosage. Our data
show that concentrations 10 times higher than 45 &#x000b5;M (ie, 0.45 mM, equivalent to
&#x02212;0.35 on the log concentration axis), even extending up to 100 times (4.5 mM,
equivalent to 0.65 on the log concentration axis) elicited a reasonably sized EZ
(0.45-4.5 mM), before falling off at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1559325818796937">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Another widely used and prescribed drug that is generally considered to be effective
and safe in therapeutic doses is Tylenol.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We used &#x0201c;over-the-counter&#x0201d; Tylenol from a local drugstore, so the maximum
concentration that we could obtain was limited to the concentration in which the
Tylenol was sold (160 mg per teaspoon, or 5 mL). Given that the standard dosage of
liquid Tylenol is 15 mL, each dose delivers 480 mg of Tylenol into the body. Again,
since the average human body has 40 L of water, this translates to 0.078 mM Tylenol.
Our data indicate a steady increase of EZ size at the tested Tylenol concentrations
up to 2 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1559325818796937">Figure 7</xref>), after
which there is a rapid decline at the higher concentrations (between 4.5 and 13
mM).</p><p>By contrast, glyphosate, marketed by Monsanto as Roundup, is the second most popular
weed killer and has been getting a lot of attention lately. It is a broad-spectrum,
nonselective, systemic herbicide, which is now well-associated with the endemic
kidney disease epidemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="bibr25-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr26-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set an enforceable regulation
for glyphosate, called a maximum contaminant level (MCL), at 0.7 mg/L, which
translates to 4.14 &#x000b5;M glyphosate with respect to water present in a human body. This
value lies in between &#x02212;4 (1.21 &#x000b5;M) and &#x02212;5 (0.121 &#x000b5;M) on the log concentration axis
of our tested solutions, indicating that while the EPA-quoted &#x0201c;permissible MCL
level&#x0201d; diminished the size of EZ, glyphosate concentrations both below and those
above MCL levels diminished EZ by 5 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1559325818796937">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>It appears, then, that all health-promoting substances tested increase the amount of
EZ water in concentration ranges reasonably in accord with those anticipated in the
body, whereas the health-impairing agent does the opposite.</p><p>Finally, why should an increase of EZ water promote health?</p><p>Health rests on cell function, which in turn results largely from protein folding.
Depending on cell type, the folding of proteins mediates numerous functions:
contraction in muscle cells, secretion in secretory cells, information transmission
in nerve cells, and so on. We ordinarily consider proteins in isolation, but in
fact, proteins are surrounded by interfacial (EZ) water.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>Hence, the normal microenvironment surrounding proteins is EZ water. Evidence
indicates that the melting of this interfacial water is a necessary step for
precipitating folding and that the restructuring of water, an energy-dependent
event, accompanies unfolding.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Thus, a full complement of EZ water would seem a necessary condition for
proper function. When EZ water is deficient, proteins lie outside their &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d;
environment and can be expected to misfold, leading to impaired or pathological function.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>
</p><p>A proposal coming from that vantage point is that restoration of EZ water can restore
function. Thus, agents that build EZ water should be beneficial to health, while
agents that diminish EZ water should impair health. As to the latter, we found here
that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, impairs EZ
buildup. In previous work, we found the same for various anesthetics.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Anesthetics block function, and we found that they diminish EZ buildup. By
contrast, all agents studied here, which enhance biological function, resulted in EZ
expansion. Hence, the results appear to support the hypothesis. A notable feature of
the hypothesis is the global, or holistic, effect of many of these substances.
Impact on diverse systems implies either of 2 options: multiple mechanisms of action
or a single mode of action that operates widely. As for the latter, a possibility is
water, which fills all cells. Thus, we hypothesize that while there may be no direct
molecular interaction between the agent and water, the action of these diverse
agents may somehow facilitate the buildup of EZ water.</p><p>Water is the raw material used for the buildup of EZ honeycomb layers from the
hydrophilic surface of Nafion.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Nafion contains oxygen atoms in its molecular structure and forms a template
for the EZ water honeycomb. Each honeycomb layer builds by locking OH-units into the
lattice, one at a time.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325818796937" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> While the negatively charged lattice motivates positively charged protons to
penetrate back into the EZ, these protons may otherwise latch onto water molecules
to form hydronium ions. Ordinarily, hydronium ions cannot enter the lattice; thus,
whatever EZ is formed continues to be well-stabilized. Health-promoting agents
evidently impact the dynamics of these processes in a way that creates additional EZ
layers. The observation that at the proper concentration, all health-promoting
agents studied build EZ water fits the proposed hypothesis. It also satisfies Occam
razor: the principle of simplicity.</p><p>In this context, a noteworthy feature is the expansion of EZ over large ranges of
concentration&#x02014;typically, several hundred or even thousand times. This implies a
beneficial effect over a sizeable dose range. On the other hand, we found that
excessive doses consistently diminish EZ size, a feature that may explain the
negative impact of overdosing. Aspirin overdose, for example, was at one time a
widely used suicidal expedient. If EZ expansion enhances health, then logically, EZ
diminution impairs health.</p><p>The mechanism of high-dose diminution of EZ size is not yet clear; however, it is
rather general, occurring with virtually all agents tested in our laboratory,
whether health promoting, health challenging, or health neutral. Possibly, the EZ
formed around each agent molecule at higher concentrations would result in an
amplified production of protons. These would now be available to invade the EZ
lattice, resulting in a measurable diminution of EZ size. This and other mechanistic
options will require more detailed investigation.</p><p>It appears that EZ expansion may be a fundamental mechanism for health improvement,
particularly in a holistic context. It will be interesting to see whether additional
health-promoting agents fit within this paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section24-1559325818796937"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Selected nutraceuticals and pain-relieving agents expand the EZ over a sizable range
of concentrations. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that agents that
promote health also build EZ. By contrast, the weed killer, Roundup, which impairs
health, steadily diminished EZ with increasing concentration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-1559325818796937"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the
