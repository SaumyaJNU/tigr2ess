Hippocampus is a pivotal part of the brain&#x02019;s limbic system which serves a critical role in memory, learning process and regulating the emotions. CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus is an area which has responsibility for matching sensory input with context-dependent retrieval for memory thus may guide behavior in different tasks. The dysfunction of CA 1 and CA3 area cause of aging or pathologic condition such as stroke vascular, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, could promote neurodegeneration disease which leads dementia as a clinical manifestation. To address the behavior differences between the age cohorts, the large number of studies was investigated between the young and aged animals in recent years [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These studies suggested significant differences were observed in various behaviors between age cohorts, indicating that aging is contributing to behavioral impairment [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, only a few researches describe the detailed mechanism on the central nervous system regarding the deterioration of cognitive ability. Moreover, the effect of age on behavior during the early stages of life in the absence of disease needs to be understood.</p><p><italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> belongs to the family Lamiaceae, is one of the potential herbs used for medication.

However, recent studies suggest that neuron death also occurs in functional aging and its seems in related to an impairment of neocortical and hippocampal functions during aging processes [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Data from WHO and Alzheimer report show increasing people suffering from dementia along with aging. Recently, dementia not only suffered by elderly or old people but also individual in the early stage of life (young adulthood to middle age). This phenomenon may occur because of the lifestyle condition of the modern people. Dementia is one of clinical manifestation from cognitive and memory impairment. Medication which promotes for curing dementia usually only administrated after the neurodegeneration diseases occur, thus it did not give any satisfying results. That is why the new finding of drugs to treat dementia is crucial not only for medication but also for prevention of disease. <italic>O. sanctum</italic> is one of herb which easies to find especially in the tropical and subtropical country. Some data already mentioned and describe <italic>O. sanctum</italic> have much beneficent as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammation, and some research also reported an ethanolic extract from <italic>O. sanctum</italic> probably might act as neuroprotection [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite its potential role in different diseases, until today restricted data are available regarding the preventive and curing effects of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> in cognitive impairment mainly with dementia as a clinical sign.</p><p>In our study, we already found that there is a decreasing amount of pyramidal cells on CA 1 and CA3 gradually from 6 months old rats (24 weeks old rat) to 9 months old rats (36 weeks old rat). When we administrated 100 mg/kg b.w. of ethanolic extract <italic>O. sanctum</italic> for 45 days showed a significant improvement in the pyramidal cell density in the CA1 and CA3 area of 9 months old rats, as same as on the young adult rats (3 months old) (Figures-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Of note, in here 9 months old rats are equal to 25 years old human (adult) whereas 3 months old as same as like 9 years old human [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Decreasing amount of pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 on the rat without treatment are in line with another evidence, which is mention that numerical density of pyramidal cells on the CA1 and CA4 on the 5-21 months old rats are less than the amount of the cells on the 1-4 months old rats [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The other research observes that the spatial learning and memory functions were declined from 8 to 12 months of age in C57BL/6J mice [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. From the functional description, the CA1 region is an area which plays an essential role to participate in new memory formation, and memory strengthens [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whereas, CA3 represents the primary component of CA1 activity through Schaffer collaterals pathway which may guarantee the sustainability signal from entorhinal cortex to reach CA1 region. The connectivity between CA1 and CA3 may enhance the long-term potentiation related to learning memory ability in the healthy individual [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, CA1 neuron number has been found related to the severity of dementia [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the sustainability pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 become important thinks. The intriguing question is how the ethanolic extract of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> may maintain and or promote increasing the density of pyramidal cell in CA1 and CA3?</p><p>To answer the question, we propose an experiment using ELISA to analyze the concentration of neurotransmitter Ach on the brain tissues. In the present study, we found that in the treatment of 100 mg/kg b.w. ethanolic extract <italic>O. sanctum</italic>, the middle-aged rats (6 and 9 months old) showed a higher concentration of Ach in comparison to the young adult age group (3 months old) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3</xref>). The increasing Ach concentration also found when we give 50 mg/kg b.w. ethanolic extract to the rat. However, there is no significant difference between treated and untreated rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure-3</xref>). Already known Ach is one of classical neurotransmitter which runs as a regulator of neuronal cells neurogenesis and differentiation [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Indeed, some investigation also reported that the cholinergic system played an important role in learning and memory [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. More importantly, Ach is a principal arranger neurotransmitter in hippocampal cholinergic transmission [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the changes of Ach output is positively related to spatial memory performance [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. From our experimental study, we can postulate that the ethanolic extract promotes Ach concentration thus it is may help the neurogenesis processes on the CA1 and CA3. The sustainability of neurogenesis on CA 1 and CA3 may help or avoid the impairment in cognitive, learning, and memory.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated daily oral administrations of 100 mg/kg b.w. ethanolic extract <italic>O. sanctum</italic> promotes the increasing of pyramidal cells density on CA1 and CA3 hippocampus. In here also we can rule out the involvement of Ach in the mechanism of neurogenesis thus may stimulate increasing density of neuronal cells in CA1 and CA3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taking together, ethanolic extract <italic>O. sanctum</italic> increase the density of pyramidal cells on CA1 and CA3 hippocampus through upregulated Ach signaling.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>DLK and HW designed the experiments and study; DLK, HW, and AH performed the experiments; DLK and HW interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript.
