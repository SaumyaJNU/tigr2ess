impeding the catalytic activity of proteolytic enzymes. They can
be found in all kingdoms of cellular life including viral genomes,
thus exhibiting its wide distribution in nature [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The
importance of proteolysis in biological processes is reflected by
the percentage of genes encoding for proteases and protease
inhibitors, accounting for about 2-4% of the genome [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These
proteases and its inhibitors are known since 20th century and
their identification has become more effective because of protease
degradomics [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and association with proteomic tools and
enzymatic assays can result in efficient characterization of a
number of novel protease inhibitors. Its characterization and
exploring its physiological significance has elevated significantly
due to their biological applicability in an array of living processes
including blood coagulation system, complement cascade,
apoptosis, cell cycle and hormone processing pathways [<xref rid="R05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
<xref rid="R06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
<xref rid="R08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. On the other hand, deficiencies or alterations in the regulation
of these enzymes determine distinct pathological conditions like
cancer, arthritis, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases
[<xref rid="R09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>PIs (protease inhibitors) are classified based on the protease they
inhibit, which comprises of serine, cysteine, aspartic and
metalloproteases [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Amidst them, serine protease inhibitors are
the largest and broadly apportioned superfamily of PIs [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>],
and on the basis of conserved functional motifs they can be
partitioned into many classes, being the Kunitz-type inhibitors
the best characterized of them, probably due to their copiousness
in several organisms [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They play a major part in
all organisms by constraining unwanted proteases that may be
harmful for its own cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In humans, they can even control
molecular pathways associated with tissue homeostasis,
development and cell defense. Some of them are also involved as
non-inhibitory molecular chaperons (HSP47), storage
(ovalbumin, in egg white), blood pressure regulation (angio
tensinogen SERPINA8) and hormone carriage proteins
(thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
Therefore, it is of interest to isolate and purify protease inhibitor
from Capsicum frutescenes.</p><p>Capsicum frutescens, coming under the solanaceae family is a
shrubby perennial plant. The leaves are broadly ovate,
acuminate, usually wrinkled, and more or less pubescent. It's
distributed throughout the warmer parts of India and cultivated.
The fruits bear a chemical called capsaicin, which reduces pain
sensations. It's associated with an array of medicinal uses
including a general ailment for various problems including upset
stomach, intestinal gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, and cramps. It
can also be used for heart and blood vessels including poor
circulation, excessive blood clotting, high cholesterol and 
prevention of heart diseases. It can also be explored as a relief for
toothache, seasickness, alcoholism, malaria and fever.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><p>Leaves of Capsicum frutescens were manually harvested locally
and authenticated by Dr. Pradeep, Department of Botany,
University of Calicut, Kerala.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of PI from Capsicum frutescens</title><p>Capsicum frutescens leaves (50g) were collected, washed and
homogenized with 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (200ml) in a
blender for 5 minutes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10000
rpm for 15 minutes at 40C. The crude extract obtained as clear
supernatant after centrifugation was used to assay protease
inhibitor activity, protein content and specific activity as
described.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Caseinolytic plate assay for PI screening</title><p>50 plants were screened for the presence of PI. Casein agar plates
were used for initial screening of protease inhibition activity. It is
a visualising method for detecting Protease inhibitors.1% Agar
and 1% casein was solidified in petri plates. Wells were made on
the agar plate using metallic plunger. Central well contains 10&#x003bc;l
trypsin (1000 U), surrounding wells contain the plant sample.
Plates were kept in incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for overnight. After
overnight incubation, adding TCA stopped the reaction and
inhibition can be clearly visualized by the decrease in diameter of
zone of trypsin in the presence of inhibitor when compared to
that of the control plate, which comprised of trypsin alone
surrounded by buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Inhibitory activity assay</title><p>To quantify the inhibitory activity, the enzyme assay was
performed in presence and absence of extracts using casein as a
substrate in 0.1M phosphate buffer as described by Kunitz et al
with slight modifications [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] 200&#x003bc;L of trypsin (SRL, India), (0.1
mg/mL) prepared in phosphate buffer was pre incubated with
200 &#x003bc;L of the protease inhibitor at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes. To this
mixture 400&#x003bc;L of 1% Hammerstein casein (SRL), prepared in 0.1
M phosphate buffer was added and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30
minutes. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 250&#x003bc;L of
0.44M, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution. The reaction mixture
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes and the absorbance
of the clear supernatant was measured at 280 nm in a UV-visible
spectrophotometer against appropriate blanks. The TCA soluble
peptide fractions of casein formed by the action of trypsin in the
presence and absence of the inhibitor were quantified by
comparing with tyrosine as standard. One unit of trypsin activity
was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberated 1&#x003bc;g of
tyrosine per milliliter of the reaction mixture per minute under
the assay conditions. One unit of protease inhibitor activity was
defined as the decrease by one unit of absorbance of TCA soluble
casein hydrolysis product liberated by trypsin action at 280 nm
per minute under the assay conditions. For easy computation and
understanding the protease inhibitor activity was expressed in
terms of percent inhibition of trypsin activity throughout the
course of study. Appropriate blanks for the enzyme, inhibitor
and the substrate were also included in the assay along with the
test.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Standard purification methods</title><p>Ammonium sulphate precipitation of the prepared sample was
done (30-90%) [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The fractionation using ammonium sulphate
precipitation removes unwanted proteins with the simultaneous
concentration of the protein of interest. The precipitate obtained
was further dialyzed against 0.01M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for
the removal of ammonium sulphate from the precipitate.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Purification of PI from Capsicum frutescens</title><p>The protease inhibitor fraction obtained after the dialysis of
ammonium sulphate precipitation was further purified by ion
exchange chromatography using CM cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) as
the cation exchanger. Proteins bind to ion-exchangers due to
surface charge. These reversibly adsorbed proteins were eluted
by a step gradient of 0.1M NaCl in 0.01 M phosphate buffer with
a flow rate of 1ml/min. Peak fractions from the column were
pooled and dialyzed against 0.01M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).
The dialyzed fractions were concentrated using amicon UF-
10KDa membrane and assayed for protease inhibitor activity,
protein content and specific activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Protein quantification</title><p>Protein content was estimated using bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as the standard and the concentration was expressed in
mg/ml. specific activity of the sample was calculated and
expressed as U/mg [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>SDS PAGE, Reverse Zymography</title><p>The molecular mass and homogeneity was determined by SDSPAGE
[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Reverse zymography is a gel-based procedure to
detect the presence of protease inhibitor. In this method 1%
gelatin is used as a substrate for proteolysis and is copolymerized
within the polyacrylamide matrix. Protein extracts are fractioned
by SDS PAGE and then the gel is treated with 0.1mg/ml trypsin,
which degrades gelatin, except in the areas where inhibitory
activity is present. After the electrophoretic run, gel was
incubated with 2.5% w/v Triton X 100 for 30 min to remove SDS
followed by rinsing the gel in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). After
the gelatin hydrolysis, the gel was washed with distilled water
and stained. Inhibition of protease activity appears as colored
bands against a clear background after staining with coomassie
brilliant blue.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Temperature and pH stability studies</title><p>Thermal stability of the inhibitor was studied by incubating
purified protease inhibitor (0.1mg/ml) at different temperatures
ranging from 40C to 1000C for 60 min. The samples were drawn
and protease inhibitor activity of each sample was assessed. The
stability of protease inhibitor over a range of pH was determined
by performing the inhibitor assay at pH 7.5, after incubating the
purified protease inhibitor at different buffers from pH 2-12 for
4hrs at 40C. The different buffers used were HCl-KCl (pH 2),
citric acid-sodium citrate (pH 4), phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), Tris
(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane-HCl (pH 8), sodium carbonatesodium 
bicarbonate (pH 10) and potassium chloride-sodium
hydroxide (pH 12).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Effect of metal ions, detergents, reducing and oxidizing agents</title><p>Effect of various metal ions on activity of protease inhibitor
activity was evaluated by incubating the protease inhibitor along
with 1mM concentrations of various metal ions in the inhibitor
solution for 30 min followed by measuring the protease inhibitor
activity. The metal salts used in the study included sodium
chloride, barium chloride, cadmium sulphate, magnesium
sulphate, sodium molybdate dehydrate, ferric chloride, calcium
chloride dehydrate, mercuric chloride and manganese chloride.
Effect of various non- ionic and ionic detergents such as Triton X-
100, Tween-80, Tween-20, SDS and CTAB on protease inhibitor
activity was determined by incubating the protease inhibitor in
each detergent at 1% w/v for 30 min, dialyzed against 0.01M
phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and estimated the residual inhibitory
activity. The effect of reducing agents on the activity of protease
inhibitor was studied by incubating the protease inhibitor with
varying concentrations of &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol
for 30 min and measuring the residual inhibitory activities were
measured in each concentration of reducing agent. Impact of
oxidizing agents on the activity of protease inhibitor was studied
by incubating the protease inhibitor with hydrogen peroxide (1-
2%, v/v) and dimethyl sulfoxide (1-5%, v/v) for 30 min and
measuring the residual inhibitory activity as described.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Caseinolytic plate assay</title><p>Out of 18 plants screened for the presence of PI, 11 of them
showed trypsin inhibitory activity in the primary screening over
casein agar plates (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the inhibition of
casein hydrolysis by trypsin by Capsicum frutescens (CF) crude
extracts in casein agar plates. Out of 11, CF was showing
maximum inhibition and thus was subjected to secondary
screening. Tyrpsin alone was showing a visible zone of diameter
corresponding to 24 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Isolation of protease inhibitor</title><p>Capsicum frutescens, which showed maximum protease inhibitor
activity, was subjected to further screening. Crude samples
prepared from the leaves of CF were partially purified by
ammonium sulphate precipitation and evaluated for their
inhibitory activity. Among the different ammonium sulphate
fractions 30-60% fraction was showing maximum specific
protease inhibitor activity of 140.67 U/mg (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Since the 30-
60% fraction recorded maximum protease inhibitor activity, it
was selected for the isolation of protease inhibitor and further
studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Purification of the protease inhibitor</title><p>Standard purification methods were employed for the
purification of protease inhibitor. The crude extract was purified
employing ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis and CM
cellulose chromatography. The yield and fold of purification of
protease inhibitor extracted from the leaves of Capsicum frutescens
is summarized in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The dialysate obtained after
ammonium sulphate saturation (30-60% fraction) was subjected
to ion exchange chromatography using CM cellulose. 2ml (5.6
mg) of ammonium sulphate (30-60%) fraction was loaded to CM
cellulose column (15x1.5 cm). peak fractions were pooled and
concentrated using Amicon 10 KDa membrane. Inhibitory
activity was shows peak with 65.81 fold of purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Characterization of the protease inhibitor</title><p>Partially purified inhibitor was further subjected to
characterization for its biophysical and physicochemical
properties like molecular weight, stability at different
temperature and pH. SDS PAGE profile of the peaks is depicted
in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Both reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE was
performed. The molecular weight from the non-reducing SDSPAGE
was determined to be 43 KDa, the prominent band present
and which gets cleaved in the reducing SDS-PAGE into two
bands of molecular weight less than 21 KDa each. This indicates
that the PI is a protein of 43 KDa and is a dimer with molecular
weight less than 21KDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This was further confirmed by
reverse zymography, which is done for confirming the presence
of protease inhibitor. Blue bands on lighter background
confirmed the presence of protease inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Stability studies</title><p>The partially purified Capsicum frutescens protease inhibitor
(CFPI) was observed to show considerable stability over a broad
range of temperatures up to 90&#x000b0;C. Although maximum activity
was observed around 30-40&#x000b0;C which gradually decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations indicate that the PI has high intrinsic
stability and which is a desirable trait for most of the
biotechnological applications of proteins and for their
commercial exploitation [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly considerable stability was
observed for a pH range up to 12, the maximum inhibitor activity
was observed at pH 7.5. It was noted that at high acidic condition
of pH 2-4, the PI was unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The high thermal and
pH stabilities of inhibitor have wide application in various
industries.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Effect of metal ions, reducing and oxidizing agents</title><p>Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Hg2+, Na2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Fe3+, Mo6+ were studied
for their impact on the activity of CFPI. Addition of Mg2+ at 1mM
concentration led to an enhancement in the PI activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).
None of the divalent ions could enhance PI activity. The effect of
different concentrations of &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol
was studied and the results are documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>From the results it was inferred that the activity was increased by
dithiothreitol up to a concentration of 60&#x003bc;M, and a concentration
above 140&#x003bc;M resulted in the complete inactivation of the
inhibitor. However, in the case of &#x003b2; - mercaptoethanol
inactivation occurred at a concentration of 400&#x003bc;M. The results
depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> testify that the protease inhibitor activity
decreased along with increase in concentrations of oxidizing
agents H2O2 and DMSO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proteolysis is one of the most indispensable metabolic processes
entailed for protein processing and turnover. During
germination, proteases are involved in the degradation of storage
proteins for the assimilation of nitrogen into biosynthetic
pathways. These enzymes are indispensable in developmental
processes like programmed cell death. Proteases are highly
specific to their substrate, and the specificity depends on the
localization of the substrate and the proteolytic enzyme, and
structural and chemical properties at the active site of the enzyme
[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plants are a rich source of protease inhibitors. In this context
in the present study, plants were screened based on the activity
of protease inhibitor and thus as a potential source for deriving
protease inhibitor. Among the different plants screened subjected
to partial purification with ammonium sulphate saturation,
maximum activity was demonstrated by Capsicum frutescens
extract compared to the others which showed much lesser
activity. Hence C. frutescens was selected as the potential source.</p><p>The proteinaceous nature of the PI was confirmed further after
partial purification using ammonium sulphate precipitation. The
phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 was standardized for the extraction of
PI and it was reported to be a good extractant for the maximal
extraction of proteins from Cajanus cajan seeds and Moringa
oleifera with high amount of trypsin inhibitor activity and protein
concentration [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The optimum pH for protease activity was
7.5.</p><p>Capsicum, also known as red pepper or chilli pepper, is an herb.
The fruit of capsicum plant is used to make medicine and is used
as a spice in food worldwide. The principal constituent being
capsaicin, seems to reduce pain sensations when applied to the
skin. This compound is responsible for its pharmacological
properties especially against obesity, hyperglycemia and pain
[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The inhibitory protein obtained from C.frutescens was partially
purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by CM
cellulose chromatography. It was found that 30-60% ammonium 
sulphate saturation was efficient for precipitating the protease
inhibitor compared to other fractions. The fold of purification of
protease inhibitor obtained for ion exchange chromatography
was 65.81 times. Fold and recovery of protein can be increased by
the combination of purification methods. The same results were
also reported in other plant species e.g.chickpea [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], A.senegal
[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and A.nilotica [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
The fold of purification obtained in this
study is comparatively higher when compared to other species
[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
Protease inhibitor purification methods reported in
the research on legumes, achieved purification levels, which
ranged from 19 to 489. The purification folds were 489 for kidney
bean [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], 19 for P.mungo [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], 116.2 for Dimorphandra mollis, 246
for Prosopis juliflora [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and 29 for Terminalia arjuna [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The purification steps were observed in 12.5% SDS-PAGE and
resolved in protein bands. The size of the plant protease inhibitor
varied from 4 to 85 KDa with the majority in the range of 8-20
KDa [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Different molecular mass was reported for protease
inhibitor from different plant resources e.g. cowpea (18.5 KDa),
soybean (19 KDa), mustard seed (20 KDa) and Cajanus cajan (14
KDa) [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Most of the plant inhibitors are active at temperatures upto 50&#x000b0;C.
In the present study the inhibitor was showing wide temperature
stability. The stability at high temperature of the inhibitor may be
attributed to its rigid and compact protein structure stabilized by
a number of disulphide linkages, as suggested for protease
inhibitor from pea seeds [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly all the protease inhibitors
isolated from plants have a wide range of pH from 2 to 10 [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
The maximum activity was at pH 7.5, while the inhibitors were
unstable at extreme acidic pH (pH 2). The amino acid
composition of plant protease inhibitors is enriched in cysteine
residues that are significant in the formation of disulphide
bridges and in conferring stability to heat, pH changes, and
proteolysis [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In the present study among the metal ions evaluated for their
impact on the activity of protease inhibitor. Addition of Mg2+ at
1mM concentration, led to an enhancement in the protease 
inhibitor activity. None of the other divalent ions could enhance
the activity. Involvement of heavy metal ions in the activity of
cysteine proteases, papain and clostripain has been reported
earlier [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These ions may be involved in maintaining structural
integrity of the inhibitor. Results obtained from the effect of
oxidizing agents H2O2 and DMSO on PI showed that the
inhibitory activity decreased along with an increase in
concentrations of oxidizing agents. Further increase in
concentration led to complete inactivation of the same. Similarly,
inhibitory activity of PI isolated from M.oleifera was declined in
response to an increase in the concentration (from 1% to 5%) of
oxidizing agents H2O2 and DMSO [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Intra sulfide bonds are
vital for the proper folding and stability of many proteins. The
effect of reducing agents studied on PI activity using &#x003b2;-
mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol indicated complete
inactivation of the inhibitor at concentrations above 150 &#x003bc;M of
dithiothreitol. Compared to this, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol inactivation
was noted at 400&#x003bc;M.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A protease inhibitor from Capsicum frutescenes was isolated and
