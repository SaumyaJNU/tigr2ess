    "Acute cough represents the most common illness evaluated in the outpatient settings. Available remedies for its management are generally allopathic combinations of antihistamines and decongestants that achieve antitussive activity, but often with unpleasant side effects prompting the need to explore safer and effective options. Honitus is an Ayurvedic proprietary herbal cough syrup with benefits of honey, intended to provide relief in acute nonproductive cough and throat irritation without causing drowsiness. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of Honitus in reducing acute nonproductive cough and throat irritation in comparison to a standard marketed allopathic cough syrup intended for use in similar conditions.This was a randomized double-blind study conducted in 105 individuals who received orally 2 tsp (10 ml) of either Honitus or marketed cough syrup (MCS) four times a day for 3 days. Response to treatment was evaluated from baseline to the end of treatment period on the basis of changes in day and night frequencies of cough, throat irritation and development of adverse events (AEs).Honitus was found safe and effective in reducing symptoms of acute nonproductive cough, throat irritation, and comparable to MCS in reducing day and night frequencies of cough, the time to relief from cough and throat irritation and the Physician's Global Assessment of cough. Honitus showed comparably better results than MCS on throat irritation, the duration of relief from cough and throat irritation without causing drowsiness. No AEs related to study or study products were reported.Honitus Syrup is safe and effective in reducing the symptoms of acute nonproductive cough and throat irritation without causing drowsiness."
