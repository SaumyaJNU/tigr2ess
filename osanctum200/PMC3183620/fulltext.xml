Meloxicam is a COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitor at its lowest therapeutic dose and is an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting prostanoid synthesis in inflammatory cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]. Meloxicam inhibits COX-2 about 12 times more selectively than COX-1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Meloxicam is reported to be safer as it produce significantly lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects as compared to diclofenac sodium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Most NSAIDs are absorbed well from gastric and intestinal mucosa. They are bound to plasma albumin and distributed all over the body evenly. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the liver by oxidation and converted to inactive metabolites, which are then typically excreted in the urine while some drugs are partially excreted in bile. Meloxicam, as NSAID, either alone or with antimicrobial drugs, is indicated for use in ruminants for the treatment of pneumonia, pleuritis, laminitis, myositis, sprain, mastitis, prolapse of uterus, premature labour etc. The principle side effect of meloxicam is gastrointestinal irritation (vomiting, diarrhea and ulceration). Rare but important side effects include liver and kidney toxicity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>].</p><p>The plant <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> belongs to family &#x0201c;Labitae&#x0201d; and is a well-known pot herb regarded as sacred by Hindus. <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (Tulsi) is a medicinal plant commonly grown in India. Different parts of this plant have been reported to exhibit several medicinal properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> has been reported to possess antihepatotoxicity property,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and two triterpenes from the leaves have been shown to possess hepatoprotective effect against carbon tetrachloride induced damage in rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The present study is formulated to study sub acute toxicity of meloxicam in Wistar rats.

The powder was stored in glass bottle in cool and dry place away from direct sunlight and used for preparation of aqueous extract. The aqueous extract was prepared by the method described earlier.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The extractability percentage was 6.25 and extract was dark brown in color.

All the animals were maintained in polypropylene cages, (47 &#x000d7; 34 &#x000d7; 18 cm). The maximum number of animals in each cage was six. Dried rice husk was used as a bedding material. Bedding material was changed every alternate day. All the animals were kept under standard managemental conditions as per the norms of Committee for the purpose of control and supervision on experiments on animals (CPCSEA), and were maintained under a controlled environment with temperature at 23 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C, relative humidity at 55 &#x000b1; 5%, and a 12-hours/12 hours light/dark cycle throughout the experiment. The animals were fed on a standard pellet diet. The pellet diet consisted of 22.02% crude protein, 4.25% crude oil, 3.02% crude fiber, 7.5% ash and 1.38% sand silica. They were given <italic>ad-lib</italic> feed and wholesome drinking water throughout the experiment.

Haematology parameters like Hemoglobin (Hb), PCV, Total Erythrocyte Count (TEC), Total Leukocyte Count (TLC), Differential Leukocyte Count (DLC) and haematocrit values were studied by standard routine procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Blood samples collected in vials without anticoagulant and were kept undisturbed.
