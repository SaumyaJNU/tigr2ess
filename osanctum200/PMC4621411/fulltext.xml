Using random combinations of rhizospheric bacterial species at different richness levels, we analysed the contribution of species richness, compositions, interactions and identity on soil microbial respiration and plant biomass. We showed that bacterial inoculation in plant rhizosphere enhanced microbial respiration and plant biomass with complementary relationships among bacterial species. Plant growth was found to increase linearly with inoculation of rhizospheric bacterial communities with increasing levels of species or plant growth promoting trait diversity. However, inoculation of diverse bacterial communities having single plant growth promoting trait, i.e., nitrogen fixation could not enhance plant growth over inoculation of single bacteria. Our results indicate that bacterial diversity in rhizosphere affect ecosystem functioning through complementary relationship among plant growth promoting traits and may play significant roles in delivering microbial services to plants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Microbial diversity in soil plays critical roles in ecosystem functioning including a large number of important processes like nutrient cycling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, promotion of plant growth and health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

For example, nitrogen fixers may provide extra nitrogen to other microbes, thus increasing their population, which, in turn, may facilitate nitrogen fixation through increasing availability of other essential nutrients like phosphorus. Here we study the functioning of microbial diversity in the rhizosphere and its role in plant growth. Bacterial strains were isolated from rhizospheric soil of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) on the basis of their common occurrence in the plant rhizosphere and their fast growing capability on nutrient agar medium. We hypothesized that the diversity in plant growth promoting traits in a bacterial community will be beneficial to plant growth, and functionally diverse bacterial community will promote more plant growth than simplified community.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Isolation and molecular characterization of rhizospheric bacteria</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (cv.

Six weeks old healthy plants were uprooted and the soil firmly attached to the roots was collected after removing loosely adhered soil by shaking vigorously. One gram of homogenised soil sample was serially diluted in saline water (0.85%) and aliquot of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L was spread on nutrient agar plates (peptic digest of animal tissue, 5&#x02009;gL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; beef extract, 1.5&#x02009;gL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; yeast extract, 1.5&#x02009;gL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; NaCl, 5&#x02009;gL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; agar 15&#x02009;gL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; HiMedia Laboratories India).

At all richness levels, species combinations were made randomly without replacement such that each species is selected equally at each of the richness level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Information Tables S2 and S3</xref>). The process of constructing a set of experimental units was carried out independently three times at each richness level, and each of the combination was replicated three times.

The advantage of the separation of species richness into linear and fixed factor is that once linear richness has been entered into the model, the effect of species identity and the effect of nonlinear species richness are orthogonal (i.e., do not share sums of squares). In this analysis, the nonlinear richness explains the effect of species interaction on the response variable. For avoiding the problem of pseudoreplication, F-statistic was calculated with specific error terms. The effects of species richness were tested against partitioned species pools and the effects of species identities against compositions. Diagnostic plots of residuals versus fitted values revealed the lack of significant heterogeneity of variance and Q-Q plots showed that assumptions of normality were justified. Cook&#x02019;s distances were tested to examine the level of influence of extreme data points. No data point was noticed influential to change the output of analyses and interpretation of results.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Plant biomass varied on inoculations with different bacteria in monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Although all the bacterial species were found to express plant growth promoting activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, only 50% of them significantly increased the plant biomass as compared to control. Two bacteria i.e. <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Brevibacillus agri</italic> were found to be better than others in increasing plant growth in monoculture. On the other hand, 60% of nitrogen-fixing bacteria were found to be plant growth promoters in pot experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Soil microbial respiration was not significantly different among species monocultures, and it was also not different from control suggesting the species individually couldn&#x02019;t increase the microbial respiration over control as analysed through our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Plant biomass increased linearly with inoculation of increasing diversity of rhizospheric bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>; F<sub>1, 172</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;133.4, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), on the other hand, no relationship was found between plant biomass and nitrogen-fixing bacterial species richness (F<sub>1, 94</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.055, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3071). Species richness, however, greatly increased soil microbial respiration (F<sub>1, 172</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.27, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 for rhizospheric bacteria and F<sub>1, 94</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60.51, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001 for nitrogen-fixing bacteria). Interestingly, some species-poor compositions performed similar to some compositions of higher richness levels indicating the positive effects of the presence of particular species in the compositions in both the cases.</p><p>As species richness was found to be an important predictor of improved plant biomass and respiration, we tried to establish if the functional diversity of plant growth promoting traits within species richness further enhances the performance of a community. A strong positive relationship was also observed between functional group richness and dependent variables (plant biomass and soil microbial respiration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). In our experiments, though species richness and functional group richness were observed to be important but found to be highly correlated (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84), and therefore it is difficult to establish their exclusive effects.</p><p>The presence of transgressive overyielding indicates the positive biodiversity effects may be due to niche complementation or mutualistic interactions. Transgressive overyielding was calculated only for plant biomass in case of rhizospheric bacteria where monocultures differed in their performance. At lower levels of species richness transgressive underyielding was also observed, however, at higher levels overyielding was prevalent. A significant relationship between transgressive overyielding and species richness was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>; F<sub>1, 44</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;29.81, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). A similar relationship was observed between transgressive overyielding and functional group richness. As monocultures within nitrogen-fixing bacterial group did not differ among themselves in their ability to promote plant growth and microbial respiration in the soil, no such analyses were performed in this case.</p><p>In linear model analyses, the linear effect of species richness on plant biomass and respiration was significant. However, in case of nitrogen-fixing bacteria the relation between species richness and plant biomass (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">3</xref>) was not noticed. The significant linear relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning indicates complementary effects of biodiversity where the presence of any new species has some additional increase in ecosystem functioning. The linear effect of species richness was significant in the case of rhizospheric bacteria only, and the absence of this effect in the case of nitrogen-fixing bacterial group shows the redundancy of functional traits in this group. Fixed effects of species richness on plant biomass were not significant at all, in any case. The fixed effect shows the effect of species richness above the complementarity, where the deviation from linearity indicates the strength of species interactions. Interestingly, the effects of species identities were found significant in the case of soil respiration in nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The effect of particular species compositions on plant biomass and soil microbial respiration was consistently significant in all the cases. It shows that regardless of the general pattern of diversity-functioning relationship, specific compositions of some species, at all richness levels, have a large effect.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Functional diversity is assumed a strong predictor of ecosystem functioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> because it can approximate niche heterogeneity in a community. We found that functionally diverse rhizospheric bacterial communities enhance plant productivity while functionally redundant nitrogen fixing community did not; the plant biomass could not increase over monocultures. Linear increase in ecosystem functioning and presence of transgressive overyielding in several combinations indicate that bacterial functional traits may work in a complementary way and enhance plant biomass. These results fall in the line of several earlier reports, where increasing bacterial richness increased ecosystem functioning of the system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, in these reports as well as in ours, some species combinations at lower richness levels were also observed to be as productive as the higher richness levels, indicating the effects of species identities in these compositions. We found significant antagonistic interactions at lower levels of species richness in case of rhizospheric bacteria, however, these were infrequent and non-significant at higher levels of species richness. It might be due to the modification of species interactions such as direct competition in the presence of other species. An increase in soil respiration with species richness in case of both experiments indicates that bacterial diversity positively affects the functioning of the microbial community, however, its impact on plant growth depends on diverse plant growth promoting activities.</p><p>Diversity effects are overall outcomes of several types of negative and positive interactions such as facilitation and competition in microbial communities. Bacterial strains, which lack a particular activity when tested alone, may act synergistically in promoting ecosystem functioning when included as a part of microbial consortia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. These interactions were reflected in transgressive underyielding in case of plant biomass, where the yield of plants inoculated with species mixture was significantly lower than maximum yielding monocultures. Similar negative biodiversity- ecosystem functioning relationships were obtained by Becker <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Besides direct antagonism among species such as toxin production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, competition for root exudates and space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> may also play a significant role in underyielding in plant biomass. Accumulation and/or dominance of underproductive species may also exert considerable influence in underyielding. The overall effect of diversity is affected by species interactions in which the positive and negative effects may neutralize each other, and the net diversity effect may be zero<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. However, at higher richness levels, this deleterious effect may be compensated by the presence of many highly productive species indicating the sampling effect of biodiversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our observations indicate that role of bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere ranges from positive to negative interactions that may also counteract each other at some instances. It is also found that plant actively recruits beneficial microorganisms in rhizosphere probably for increasing its fitness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> through antagonising harmful microorganisms. The probability of including beneficial microorganisms increases with diversity compensating the deleterious effects caused by opportunists. It is supported by our results also where increasing trends in diversity effects (overyielding) with species richness were observed. At higher levels of richness, the beneficial effects superimpose deleterious one and overall improvement in ecosystem services may be achieved.</p><p>Several limitations should be considered before generalising the results of present and all similar type of studies. The diversity of our system was very low, and the observations are based on short-term response to initial diversity. The competitive relationships among species may, however, change with long-term observations due to the extirpation of some species. In the present experiment, only a minor part of the variation in plant growth could be explained by bacterial richness, however, this would remain an active question of research that may provide better understanding of rhizosphere ecosystem functioning. In conclusion, we have shown that complementarity among different plant growth promoting traits within the community is useful in increasing plant productivity. These observations would be helpful in understanding plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Singh, M. <italic>et al.</italic> Complementarity among plant growth promoting traits in rhizospheric bacterial communities promotes plant growth. <italic>Sci.
