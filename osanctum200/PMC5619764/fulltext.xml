The PdNPs are characterized by techniques like FTIR, TEM, SEM-EDX, XRD and XPS analysis. It is worthnoting thatwhen the synthesis of nanoparticles was carried out in absence of starch, agglomeration of particles has been noticed.The starch-assisted PdNPs showed excellent aqueous-phase catalytic activities for three important reactions: the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides (aryl bromides and iodides) with arylboronic acids; selective oxidations of alcohols to corresponding carbonyl compounds; and reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III). Our catalyst could be reused up to four cycles without much compromising with its activity. Furthermore, the material also demonstrated excellent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities against a novel multidrug resistant clinical bacterial isolate <italic>Cronobactersakazakii</italic> strain AMD04.

Amid other metal NPs, Pd is gaining special mention because of its profound applications as catalyst in large number of organic transformations which includevarious types of carbon-carbon cross-coupling [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]and reduction reactions. [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Traditionally, Pd NPs are synthesized <italic>via</italic> various physical or chemical methods with the aid of toxic and hazardous reducing and stabilizing agents, however, over the years, in the quest of &#x02018;going green&#x02019;, there has been a paradigm shift towards bio-inspired strategies for the synthesis of metal NPs [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The biocompatibility and environmentally benign properties attributes to these biological techniques to supersede the conventional physical and wet-chemical methods. The field of biological synthesis of Pd NPs encompasses the use of plant extracts, microorganisms, marine organisms, <italic>etc</italic>. as green-reductants. Amongst those methods, the tapping of bio-resources, particularly the plant extracts for the synthesis of the NPs seems promising owing to their ready availability, rapid process, better cost-effectiveness, and the ability to use in large-scale biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, plant mediated syntheses of PdNPs, has gained many recent attentions[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Examples include use of peel-extract of banana [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], leaf-extracts of <italic>Pulicaria glutinosa</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>],<italic>Perilla frutescens</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>],<italic>Euphorbia granulate</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>],<italic>Ocimum Sanctum</italic>[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>],<italic>etc</italic>. and some of the systems have been successfully applied as catalysts for organic reactions like Suzuki-Miyaura reactions[<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], oxidation of alcohols [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], hydrodechlorination of p-chlorophenol [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], <italic>etc</italic>. Unfortunately, baring a couple of examples [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], majority of these reported plant-based catalysts often suffer from limitations like high reaction temperatures (up to 120&#x000b0;C), high catalyst loadings (up to 12 mol%), limited substrate scopes and / or use of undesirable organic solvents as reaction, etc. Moreover, the reported plant-based Pd NPs mostly tested for a single catalytic system, while their multifunctional potentiality remains largely under-explored. Thus, the appropriate selection of plant extract which can bestow multifunctional roles <italic>viz</italic>., bio-reduction of Pd salts, aid in multiple catalytic reactions and afford biological activities is highly desirable. In this context, we would like to exploit a bio-resource namely <italic>Garcinia pedunculata</italic> Roxb aqueous leaf extract for the synthesis of Pd NPs. This leaf extract has been traditionally known to possess multiple medical uses, validated by ethno-pharmaceutical research [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Literature reveals the presence of phytochemical constituents like polyphenol, flavonoid, hydroxycitric acid in the leaf extract, which functions as active components for bio-reduction [<xref rid="pone.0184936.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the potentiality of this plant has not been explored for synthesizing and functionalizing metal NPs till date. Herein, along with the synthesis of PdNPs, we have also explored the versatility of these NPs as multifunctional catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides, alcohol oxidation and Cr(VI) to Cr(III) reduction reactions using water as a reaction media. The antibacterial activity of the Pd NPs was also was investigated against a novel multidrug-resistant clinical bacterial isolate <italic>Cronobacter sakazakii</italic> strain AMD04. It is worth mentioning that the novelty of this reported synthesis of Pd NPs lies in appropriate selection of the bio-resource, which not only aids in the synthesis, but unlike other biogenic process plays a crucial role in bestowing multiple catalytic and antibacterial properties. Of note, the multifunctional catalytic aspects of the synthesized PdNPs viz., C-C cross-coupling, oxidation and reduction reactions constitute an added asset.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Experimental materials and methods</title><p>Fresh green leaves of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>pedunculata</italic> Roxb (ESI: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184936.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) were collected from Dergaon area (26.6969&#x000b0; N, 93.9853&#x000b0; E) of Golaghat District, Assam, India.

Based on our initial success; we have tested the scope of our catalytic system for other representative aryl bromides or iodides including heteroaryl halides that are usually difficult to activate in the Suzuki reaction. Our study revealed that aryl bromides and iodides bearing electron-neutral (entry 4 &#x00026; 5), electron-withdrawing (entry 3 &#x00026; 6) and electron-donating groups (entry 2) underwent smooth coupling with phenylboronic acid and almost quantitative conversion was obtained in all the cases.

Similar studies carried out using AuNPs suggested that the increased stress exerted by nanoparticles on microbial cells resulted in increased planktonic growth and decreased adhesion of microbes on substrate.</p><fig id="pone.0184936.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0184936.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Graph showing anti-biofilm effect of PdNPs against MDR clinical isolate <italic>Cronobactersakazakii</italic> strain AMD04.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0184936.g010"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we presented a green protocol of synthesizing PdNPs by using aqueous leaf extract of <italic>Garciniapedunculata</italic>Roxb as bio-reductant. The PdNPs showed excellent activity as catalyst for three important reactions namely the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, alcohol oxidation and reduction of Cr(VI) to nontoxic Cr(III). The Pd NPs also showed excellent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities against a novel MDR clinical isolate <italic>Cronobactersakazakii</italic> AMD04. The MIC and MBC values of Pd NPs are much lower than that of USP administration limit for oral tolerable daily intake, which make these PdNPs potential drug candidate to fight against MDR bacteria. The multifunctional applications along with &#x02018;in water&#x02019; reactions for both synthesis and catalysis are the main features of our catalyst.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>Garcinia pedunculata</italic> roxbleaves used for nanoparticle synthesis.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>HRMS spectrum of bio-extract of <italic>Garcinia pedunculata</italic> Roxb.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>TEM images of PdNPs in absence of starch.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>SEM-EDX images of the PdNPs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>FTIR spectra of PdNPs andpowdered dry leaf of <italic>Garcinia pedunculata</italic> Roxb.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>DLS spectra of PdNPs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s006.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>XPS survey spectrum of the PdNPs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s007.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s008"><label>S8 Fig</label><caption><title>TG thermogram of biosynthesized PdNPs.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s008.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s009"><label>S9 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic relationship of the MDR isolate <italic>Cronobacter sakazaki</italic> strain AMD04 (highlighted in yellow colour) with ten most closely related strains based on BLAST results taking <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic> ATCC 15580 as out group.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s009.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s010"><label>S10 Fig</label><caption><title><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the products for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s010.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s011"><label>S11 Fig</label><caption><title>Mass spectra of selected products for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s011.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184936.s012"><label>S12 Fig</label><caption><title>Mass spectra of products for the alcohol-oxidation reaction.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184936.s012.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Department of Biotechnology is gratefully acknowledged for financial support (Grant no:MED/2013/23) under DBT-Twinning programme and also for providing Delcon as well as IBT hub facility to the Centre for Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Dibrugarh University.
