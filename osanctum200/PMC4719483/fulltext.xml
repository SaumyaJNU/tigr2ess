This signifies impaired learning and memory with cyclosporine insult. There was no significant difference between readings of day 25 and 26. Treatment with Piracetam failed to reverse both learning and memory impairment induced by cyclosporine. However, treatment with plant drugs, showed a trend toward reduction in TL when tested on day 25 but these values were not significantly less than cyclosporine control [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Thus, none of the plant drugs were found to correct the learning impairment induced by cyclosporine. However, on day 26, there was decrease in TL and it was significantly less as compared to cyclosporine control as well as Piracetam treated mice indicating the ability of plant drugs to reverse the memory deficit induced by cyclosporine. The TL of mice treated with <italic>Tc</italic>, <italic>Pe</italic>, H1 and H2 formulations remained comparable with each other like in earlier model. Amongst all, again H2 formulation showed better values but statistically all the plant drugs were comparable [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The dearth of an ideal drug for dementia in modern medicine prompted us to investigate traditional system of Indian medicine-Ayurveda. Various plants have shown actions on learning and memory. Studies are done on <italic>Bacopa monniera</italic>, <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, <italic>Rose alba</italic>, <italic>Dacus carota</italic>, <italic>Desmo gagenticum</italic>, <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>, <italic>Convolvulus pluricaulis</italic>, <italic>Eclipta alba</italic>, <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, <italic>Myristica fragrance</italic>, <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, <italic>Butea frondosa</italic>, <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>, <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic>, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, St. John's wort, <italic>Kava kava</italic> and <italic>Valerian</italic> for their actions in brain disorders.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Indian traditional system, Ayurveda mentions plants like <italic>Pe</italic>, <italic>Tc</italic> and <italic>Os</italic> to have memory enhancing properties. Fruits of <italic>Pe</italic>, stems of <italic>Tc</italic> and leaves of <italic>Os</italic> have been evaluated earlier for their effects on learning and memory performances and have shown promising results.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] <italic>Os</italic> also reported to have anti-inflammatory, chemo-preventive, antioxidant, adaptogenic, psychopharmacological activities.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Additionally <italic>Os</italic> extracts have shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and improve cognition in rats and also reversed the ibotenic acid or colchicine induced learning and memory deficits.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Recently published review by Cohen has highlighted multiple important uses of <italic>Tulsi</italic> including the actions against physical, chemical, metabolic and psychological stress.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The Ayurvedic texts also revealed that these plants are often prescribed in combination as per the concept of <italic>Pathsanyojana</italic> or rational combination of drugs.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In the Indian market too; most of the Ayurvedic formulations for improving learning and memory are multi-ingredient in nature. <italic>Tc</italic>, <italic>Pe</italic> and <italic>Os</italic> are often the common ingredients of these formulations. Though the efficacy of extracts of individual plants was proven, an extensive literature search revealed that the effects of a combination of these three plant drugs on learning and memory had not been evaluated using modern scientific methodology. It was, therefore, interesting to find out whether combining these plants produces a greater effect on learning and memory. The results of the present study substantiated the memory enhancing properties of <italic>Tc</italic>, <italic>Pe</italic> and <italic>Os</italic> as seen in earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It has also shown that effects of individual plant drugs as well as in combination were comparable and at times better to those of modern medicinal agents. In addition, the effects of combinations of <italic>Tc</italic> and <italic>Pe</italic> with or without <italic>Os</italic> were not more than those of the individual agents.</p><p>Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of cognitive functions. According to the cholinergic hypothesis, memory impairments in patients with senile dementia are due to a selective and irreversible deficiency of the cholinergic functions in the brain.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Hence, Rivastigmine is used in the management of Alzheimer's dementia. Similarly, scopolamine, an antimuscarinic agent has shown memory impairment when given to mice shortly before training.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Thus, a model of amnesia induced by scopolamine was selected in the present study. Rivastigmine is a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and increases acetylcholine concentration in the brain.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] By increasing high-affinity choline uptake, Piracetam facilitates acetylcholine production and turnover with varying actions at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Hence, we used these two positive controls in the present study. The plant drugs have successfully prevented the learning impairment and deficit in short-term memory caused by scopolamine insult. The effects of Rivastigmine and Piracetam on memory were comparable though plant drugs showed a trend toward enhancement. Amongst all the plant drugs, H2 formulation exhibited promising results and was significantly better than Piracetam indicating actions on the cholinergic system that was possibly enhanced by <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic>. This suggests that selected plant drugs may have actions on the cholinergic system or preventing the effects of the cholinergic blocker. But in the present study, acetylcholinesterase activity or concentration of acetylcholine was not measured. Hence, the exact mechanism of action of these plant drugs cannot be commented upon.</p><p>Diazepam and several other benzodiazepines have been reported to impair learning and memory in animals and humans.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Diazepam is known to produce anterograde amnesia and state-dependent learning.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Thus, it was used as an amnestic agent in the present study. As the mechanism of action of diazepam is mediated through facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] it was decided not to use Rivastigmine as a positive control, which has a specific action mediated through acetylcholine. Instead, Piracetam was selected due to its nonspecific nootropic actions and multiple mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] As evident from the results, diazepam impaired learning in EPM test. The learning impairment appears to be partly due to anxiolytic effect. This was contrary to the observations made by Itoh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] The plant drugs prevented the amnestic effect of diazepam indicating possible actions on GABA that needs to be evaluated further.</p><p>Cyclosporine has shown to cause degeneration of neurons and subsequent memory deficit.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The dose and regime of pretreatment with cyclosporine was as described by Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2002.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] <italic>Tc</italic> has successfully reversed the memory deficit and protected against the neurodegenerative changes produced by cyclosporine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus we used cyclosporine to induce amnesia by neurodegeneration and the findings of Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 2002 corroborate with ours.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this model too, Piracetam was selected as a positive control based on the claims regarding its neuroprotective effects.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Treatment with plant drugs after the use of cyclosporine has shown to reverse the memory impairment indicating possible protective effects of plant drugs against the degeneration of neurons induced by cyclosporine. The results with the plant drugs were significantly better as compared to Piracetam indicating possibly better neuroprotective effects, which can be substantiated further by studying histopathological examination of mice brains.</p><p>The present study revealed that both, H1 and H2 formulations have memory-enhancing properties in normal animals. In three models of amnesia, wherein memory impairment was induced by scopolamine, diazepam, and cyclosporine, they showed promising results and these effects were comparable and at times better than currently used modern medicinal agents like Rivastigmine and Piracetam. However, the results with a combination of <italic>Tc</italic> + <italic>Pe</italic> with or without <italic>Os</italic> were comparable. Moreover, their effects were not statistically different than the individual plant drug that is, <italic>Tc</italic> and <italic>Pe</italic>. Hence, the concept of <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic> could not be explored in the present study but results showed a trend of better effects with <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic> that can be evaluated further. These results are consistent with our earlier findings using complex maze, evaluating spatial learning and memory in rats.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</p><p>Validation of <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic> will need series of studies involving larger sample size and multiple models that was beyond the scope of the present study. It will be interesting to compare the combination of these plant drugs with the <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic> on individual plant drugs. It will also be interesting to compare these plant formulations with only <italic>Os</italic> treated group as well. This offers a good scope for further research, which can help validation of <italic>Bhavana samskara</italic>.</p><p>The plant drugs have also shown to have some possible actions on the cholinergic system, GABA and in the prevention of neurodegeneration. This can be further studied using tests like acetyl-cholinesterase assay or histopathological examination of brains in affected animals to see the reversal of neurodegenerative changes. It is important to carry out further studies with both the plant formulations as well as single-ingredient plant drugs using battery of other behavioral tests including tests for effects on long-term memory. Multiple such studies will help us to identify the lead compound, which can be developed further by exploring for its mechanism/s of action using various neurobiological and cellular techniques. And further investigations in human subjects and patients with dementia will make it a valuable and cost-effective addition to the existing armamentarium of the nootropics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Bhavana Samskara on <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> and <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> combination showed promising results as nootropic agent st times it was better than modern medicinal agents.
