In the recent decade, dengue has re-emerged and with it being endemic in more than 110 countries, it has been the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two fifths of the world populations are at risk, estimating around 100 million of dengue fever infections, 2.1 million cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 200 thousand deaths worldwide are caused by dengue every year. Despite extremely high rates of dengue for decades, Southeast Asia region still recorded an increase of 67% from 1985-1989 to 2002-2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Similarly, a total of 4.6-fold increase in dengue cases has also been reported in America over the three decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Dengue appears in two forms; the first classic dengue fever with symptoms that range from mild fever to high fever with retro-orbital pain, severe headaches, maculopapular rashes, muscle and joint pain. The other more severe form, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) may present with abdominal bleeding, hemorrhage and circulatory failure, which is fatal if without prompt and proper management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There are four serologic types of dengue virus, DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4. A primary infection with any of the four serotypes results in a lifelong immunity to that serotype, and temporary immunity to the others. However, this temporary immunity usually wanes after 6 months, at which point an individual is susceptible to the other three DENV serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The primary infection is most often asymptomatic, but sequential infections in the presence of heterologous dengue antibodies often leads to a more severe secondary infection causing DHF or DSS. Murrel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] attributed this to the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect. Studies on the outbreaks in endemic areas, such as South East Asia revealed that a primary infection with DENV-1 or DENV-3 frequently resulted in a more severe disease than if DENV-2 or DEV-4 were the primary infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>With the rapid expansion of dengue disease in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world, it is crucial to develop effective prevention and control measures, including antiviral drugs and vaccines against dengue disease. However, the development of a dengue vaccine is complicated by the ADE effect, which happens when a child experiences a second dengue infection with a different serotype from the previous infection, causing DHF/DSS. The vaccine must not only protect against all four dengue serotypes but also must avoid inducing the ADE effect. Early studies have shown that extract from different parts of plants could provide good antiviral results as compared to their synthetic analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As such, the development of a plant-based antiviral preparation promises a more potential alternative in combating dengue disease. Over the years, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocated that countries should interact with traditional medicine with a view to identify and exploit aspects that provide safe and effective remedies for ailments of antiviral. In addition, there are still no antiviral drugs being tested against dengue disease in any clinical trials. As such, present studies aimed to screen and determine the anti-dengue activity of methanolic extracts of <italic>Andrographis paniculata </italic>(Burm. f.) Nees<italic>, Citrus limon </italic>(L.) Burm. f., <italic>Cymbopogon citratus </italic>(DC.)

The botanical identities of each plant were determined and authenticated by taxonomist from Institute of Bioscience, University Putra Malaysia. After the taxonomy identification, the plants were washed and cleaned prior to air drying at room temperature for one week. The whole aerial body of <italic>A. paniculata, O. sanctum, P. citrosum </italic>and <italic>C. citratus </italic>was blended and used. As for <italic>C. limon </italic>and <italic>M. charantia</italic>, the roots and entire fruits were utilised, respectively. Upon drying, 100 g of the plant materials were ground to powder and extracted consecutively with 500 mL of absolute methanol (Fisher Scientific, UK) for three to four days in dark condition. The resulting suspension was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure at 50&#x000b0;C until dryness.</p></sec><sec><title>Standardisation of extracts</title><p>Standardisation of extracts was carried out based on the total flavanoids content of the extracts measured using aluminium chloride colourimetric assay as described by Pourmorad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For this assay, 0.1 mg of extract was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol. The solution was then mixed with 0.1 mLof 10% (v/v) aluminium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 0.1 mL of 1 M potassium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 2.8 mL of distilled water. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance reading of the reaction mixture was measured at 415 nm using spectrophotometer (UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Japan) with methanol as blank. A standard curve was constructed using quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as the standard at the concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 &#x003bc;g/mL. Total flavonoids content of the extracts was then compared with the standard curve, expressed in mg quercetin equivalents per 100 g dry weight (mg QE/100 g DW) and further calculated as % of total flavonoids content.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of extracts</title><p>For the cytotoxicity and antiviral assays, a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 2.0 g of extract in 100 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich, USA).

Cells were transferred carefully to 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks (Corning, USA) containing 4 mL of DMEM with 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (GIBCO, South America). Cells were then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 2 to 3 days until confluent.</p><p>At 80-100% confluency, the cells were subcultured. The subculturing process was initiated by removing the used medium followed by rinsing the cells twice with Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (MP Biomedical, France). Then, 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO, Canada) was added and incubated for 5 to 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. After trypsinisation, 1 mL of fresh medium with 10% FBS was added and mixed. The mixture was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded while the pellet was resuspended with 2 mL of fresh medium and re-distributed into new tissue culture flask for further maintenance.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of virus stock</title><p>The serotype of dengue virus obtained from Makmal Kesihatan Awam Kebangsaan (MKAM), Malaysia was confirmed through Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The PCR was conducted based on the protocols described by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In brief, the nucleotide sequence (~400 bp) of the dengue virus was amplified using the primers, AD3 5' CTGATTTCCATCCCGTA 3' and AD4 5' CATATGGGTTATTGGATAGA 3'. The PCR products were then sequenced. The sequencing results were compared with the library sequences using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Thus, the dengue virus obtained was confirmed to be of serotype 1 (DENV-1).</p><p>The stock of dengue virus was obtained by adding 1 mL of DENV-1 to confluent Vero E6 cells and gently shaken for 1 hour to maximise the viral adsorption to the cells.

The proportion of wells with CPE in each serially diluted DENV-1 was calculated and the TCID<sub>50 </sub>was estimated using the formula 'Log TCID<sub>50 </sub>= L - d (s - 0.5)', whereby L = lowest dilution factor; d = difference between dilution steps; s = sum of proportion. The value of TCID<sub>50 </sub>determined was applied in the antiviral assay.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>antiviral assay</title><p>The <italic>in vitro </italic>antiviral assay was initiated by seeding 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well into each well of 96-well plate, and left to incubate at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the medium was removed and 100 &#x003bc;L of each plant extract at its MNTD was added. After incubating for 1 hour, 100 &#x003bc;L of DENV-1 at its TCID<sub>50 </sub>was added. The assay was also conducted with the controls, which included the cells alone, cells treated with extracts and cells with DENV-1. The 96-well plate was further incubated for five days, after which the CPE of the cells were observed under inverted microscope on a daily basis. The antiviral effect of each plant extract was assessed using a grading system as described by Kudi and Myint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], whereby the degree of CPE inhibition upon treatment was marked at the following order: '++++' represented a total inhibition, '+++' for 75% inhibition, '++' for 50% inhibition, '+' for less than 50% inhibition, '-' as no inhibition. The antiviral assay for each plant extract was conducted in five replicates and repeated twice.</p><p>The potency of these extracts on DENV-1 inhibition were also further examined using MTT assay, in which the percentage of viability of cells alone, cells infected with DENV-1, and infected cells treated with extracts at MNTD were measured and compared.

As determined in this study, these two plants also recorded the highest amount of total flavonoids content. Hence, it is anticipated that the flavonoids present in the methanolic extract might have contributed to a high cytotoxic concentration. Flavanoids have been reported to possess antioxidative activities, such as to inhibit lipid peroxidation, chelate redox-active metals and inhibit free-radical mediated events and even increasing resistance to DNA strand breakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These protect the cells by scavenging of free radicals that cause oxidative stress and can also induce changes in membrane to reduce membrane lipid and protein oxidation. Oteiza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] suggested that the flavonoids interact at the surface of bilayers to reduce the access of harmful oxidants, thus protecting the structure and function of membranes.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>antiviral assay</title><p>In order to screen the anti-dengue properties of methanolic extracts of the six medicinal plants, <italic>in vitro </italic>antiviral assay was conducted. The antiviral assay was initiated using the MNTD of each plant extract against TCID<sub>50</sub>. Prior to the qualitative observation of antiviral assay, a grading system was developed according to Kudi and Myint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This system denoted the degree of inhibition seen under inverted microscope using the '+' symbol. The more '+' symbols signified a higher percentage of inhibition was observed whereas the '-'symbol indicated no inhibition or widespread cell death. Thus, '++++' represented a total inhibition, '+++' for 75% inhibition, '++' for 50% inhibition, '+' for less than 50% inhibition and '-' as no inhibition was observed upon the treatment with methanolic extracts.</p><p>The Vero E6 cells grown in the tissue culture flasks with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS would form a monolayer sheet of cells. The morphology of Vero E6 cells were clearly visualised using an inverted light microscope. Under 200&#x000d7; magnification, the uninfected Vero E6 cells were polygonal in shape with well defined, black nuclei in the centre.

From the observation, it was clearly shown that DENV1-infected cells showed CPE, which refers to the structural changes of the host cell due to viral infection. Generally, in comparison to the uninfected monolayer sheet of Vero E6 cells, DENV1-infected cells appeared to have a congested and haphazard pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Cytopathic effects included syncytia formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and cell lysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Syncytia formation could be due to viral fusion proteins being transported to the cell surface membranes, which later fused with neighbouring cells. In addition, blebbing of cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), which referred to small detached remnants of apoptotic bodies that have undergone programmed cell death could also be observed upon DENV-1 infection.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Various cytopathic effects observed in DENV-1-infected Vero E6 cells after 7 days post infection</bold>.

Observation of CPE under the inverted microscope showed the presence of fragmented cells and debris (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Nevertheless, this was not in accordance with the MTT assay conducted as only 48.0% and 32.0% of the cells treated with <italic>O. sanctum </italic>and <italic>C. citrates </italic>survived upon DENV-1 infection, respectively. The values recorded were not much differed from 44.6% achieved in the positive control that infected with DENV-1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The variation in findings based on CPE and MTT assay could be due to the fact that these extracts were able to inhibit the cytopatic effect without inhibiting the virus replication in Vero E6 cells. Among the six plant extracts tested, <italic>C. limon </italic>and <italic>P. citrosum </italic>did not prevent CPE or cell death from the effects of DENV-1. The normal polygonal-shaped cells were not visible followed by widespread of cell death, indicated by the amount of debris strewn across Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>. Furthermore, cells treated with <italic>P. citrosum </italic>showed granulation and cell densing (pyknosis).</p><p><italic>A. paniculata, C. limon, C. citratus, M. charantia, O. sanctum </italic>and <italic>P. citrosum </italic>have been traditionally known to possess antiviral activity. Out of the six plants tested, <italic>C. citratus, O. sanctum, P. citrosum </italic>and <italic>C. limon </italic>showed no anti-dengue activity even though some of their methanolic extracts exhibited high total flavonoids content. One of the possible explanations to this non-inhibitory effect could be that there lies a relationship between the structure of the flavonoids and antiviral activity as described by Sanchez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It was found in their comparative study that flavonoids with no prenyl side-chain totally lacked anti-dengue activity. <italic>P. citrosum </italic>and <italic>C. limon </italic>extracts showed obvious cell death when treated with DENV-1 infected control cells. A possible explanation to this result could be that the compounds present in these plants could have affected cell proliferation instead of virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], thus, preventing the cell sheet from regrowing after DENV-1 infected cell death.</p><p>In this preliminary screening study for anti-dengue agent, methanolic extract of <italic>A. paniculata </italic>and <italic>M. charantia </italic>was found to have high potential to be an anti-dengue agent, particularly towards DENV-1 serotype. <italic>A. paniculata </italic>extract showed a total of 75% of inhibition while <italic>M. charantia </italic>showed approximately 50% of inhibition on CPE upon infection with DENV-1. These findings suggested that the anti-dengue activity might be owing to the presence of flavonoid compounds or other compounds such as terpenes and polyphenols that were extractable by methanol. Various flavonoid compounds have been documented to possess antiviral properties. For instance, <italic>M. charantia </italic>that was reported to show anti-HSV-1, polio type 1, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was found to contain flavonoids such as lutelin, kampherol and quercetin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Flavonoids are able to inhibit viruses by inhibiting different pathways. Chang et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] disclosed that dehydroandrographolide succinic acid monoester (DASM) could interfere with cell fusion, thus preventing HIV from entering the cell. Alternately, certain flavonoids with potent anti-HIV effects are capable of inhibiting virus associated reverse transcriptase and even cellular DNA or RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Even though flavonoid compounds have been the main constituent of interest in search of anti-dengue agent, the role of diterpenes such as andrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide present in methanolic extract of <italic>A. paniculata </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] against DENV-1 should not be neglected. Andrographolide, and 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide have been reported to exhibit anti-HIV activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similarly, methanolic extract of <italic>M. charantia </italic>was found to contain terpenes, saponins and steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In a related study, the methanolic extract of <italic>M. charantia </italic>was presumed to contain the major compound such as unglycosides terpenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, there is a lack of literature to support that unglycoside terpenes cause any antiviral activity.</p><p>There are two probable pathways that could be the mode of antiviral action: 1) interfere with viral adsorption, and 2) inhibit viral replication. Schitzler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] noted that pre-treatment of the cells might give the cells protective effects against viruses by preventing viral adsorption. Furthermore, the dengue virus E protein is a potential target of inhibition due to its principal role in cell membrane adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As such, there is a possibility that the extract supplied might have blocked the E protein. Alternatively, the inhibitive event could have also occurred during viral replication. One stage of inhibition of viral replication by flavonoids was found using flavonoid SP-303, which showed a mode of antiviral action on DNA and RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Another stage of inhibition of viral replication might be by blocking certain enzymes, such as an antiviral compound (NITD-982) that inhibit an enzyme needed for pyrimidine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Non-structural proteins are also potential targets of inhibition. For example, a study on STAT2, a component of type-1 interferon signalling pathway that is targeted for degradation once nNS5 is bound to it. The study showed that mouse STAT2 could restrict early dengue virus replication <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Studies on <italic>Andrographis paniculata </italic>and <italic>Momordica charantia </italic>that showed anti-dengue properties should be further conducted extensively. Isolation, purification and characterisation of the active compounds in order to discover the potential anti-dengue compounds should be carried out. Furthermore, investigations into the mode of action of anti-dengue activities by the active compounds can be done to provide more insight into inhibition of dengue adsorption and replication.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>CPE: cytopathic effects; DENV-1: Dengue virus serotype 1; DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; FBS: Fetal Bovine Serum; MNTD: maximum non-toxic dose; TCID<sub>50</sub>: median tissue culture infective dose</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>APKL participated in the design and coordination of the study, carried out the extraction and standardization studies and edited the manuscript.
