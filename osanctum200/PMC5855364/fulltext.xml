The foremost drawback of poultry production in tropical and subtropical countries is high environmental temperature and humidity as it induces a heat stress to the birds by altering its thermoregulatory mechanisms. Birds have a greater challenge in maintaining homoeothermic body temperature during heat stress because of the absence of the sweat glands and higher body temperature when compared to other domestic animals.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Earlier studies reported that an increase in temperature above 25&#x000b0;C significantly lowers the growth rate of broilers.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Typically, birds can tolerate and adapt to the temperature of about 20&#x000b0;C&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C, and beyond this, it turns down the birds' immunity, feed intake, weight gain, egg production, hatchability of fertile eggs, number of eggs and carcass quality, mineral balance, semen quality, and fertility in male birds.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>As the ratio of humidity and temperature overdoes the thermal comfort zone, the birds start to exhibit the signs of heat stress. The cardinal symptoms exhibited by birds during heat stress are gasping, panting, pale comb and wattle, dull and depressed, decreased appetite, and increased cannibalism resulting in production loss.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] During the heat stress condition, birds would be panting excessively by keeping the mouth wide opened, spreading the wings, and squatting close to the ground and more blood flow gets diverted from internal organs to skin which leads to dark skin color.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, during the period of heat stress, most of the production energy would be engaged toward the thermoregulatory adaptations which results in induction of oxidative stress in birds. Birds of all ages could be susceptible to heat stress but it is more common in meat-type rather than egg-type birds that is why raising broilers under increased environmental temperature had gained much attention.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Combating heat stress remains a challenge for the broiler industry in the tropics and subtropics, which is even aggravated by the changing climatic conditions. Heat stress exhibits a negative response on body weight, plasma glucose, protein and cortisone level, heterophil lymphocyte ratio (H:L ratio), and sometimes even lead to increased mortality. The development of novel dietary measures such as supplementation of anti-stress agents, vitamins, and minerals may be beneficial in ameliorating heat stress and enhancing optimum performance in broiler chickens.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Of several strategies, the dietary modification is one of the most preferred which could be accomplished using traditional antioxidants such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and acetylsalicylic acid to attenuate the effects of heat stress on performance of birds.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Moreover, supplementation with Vitamin C is the most beneficial among other vitamins throughout the heat stress period.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid is nonessential vitamin in poultry diet as the birds possess the enzyme gluconolactone oxidase required for its biosynthesis in kidneys;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] however, the ability to synthesize Vitamin C becomes inadequate during heat stress.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Phytocee&#x02122; (M/s Natural Remedies Private Limited, Bengaluru, India) is a polyherbal supplement for poultry and other animal species, a combination of herbs, namely <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic>, <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>, and <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>. All these plants are reported for their antioxidant property.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Phytocee&#x02122; was extensively studied for its efficacy and safety in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models; it demonstrated a significant antioxidant and protective effect against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress in albino Wistar rats.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In addition, cellular antioxidant potential of Phytocee&#x02122; was demonstrated against AAPH-induced oxidative stress using HepG2 cells and reported to be safe and free from causing toxic effects in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In the traditional system of Indian medicine, polyherbal formulations and combined extracts of plants are used as a drug of choice rather than individual plants and extracts.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This therapeutic approach is not considered to be an alternative to conventional medicine by others due to lack of scientific validation of efficacy and safety.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] An editorial in Journal of American Medical Association emphasizes that the fundamental issue is not traditional medicine versus alternative medicine, but medical practice supported by clinical and scientific evidence.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, there is an obvious need for establishing the proof of efficacy of these polyherbal formulations in target animal species. Although scientific evidence is available for antioxidant and anti-stressor activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, Phytocee&#x02122; is not scientifically validated for its efficacy as an anti-stressor in broiler chickens exposed to heat stress. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the anti-stressor activity of Phytocee&#x02122; in broiler using heat stress model in comparison with Vitamin C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Phytocee&#x02122;</title><p>Phytocee&#x02122; is a proprietary polyherbal formulation developed by M/s.

One hundred leukocytes including granular (heterophil, eosinophil, and basophil) and nongranular (lymphocyte and monocyte) cells were counted on duplicates slide per bird, and the H: L ratio was calculated using the average counts of these cell types.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Determination of serum corticosterone level</title><p>On day 42, the blood samples (approximately 2 ml) were collected from 12 birds per group (2 birds/replicate) in plain centrifuge tubes (BD Vacutainer tube, India). The blood was collected from brachial vein of chicks and serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. The serum corticosterone level was measured using a commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, this assay is based on the competition between corticosterone and a corticosterone-acetylcholinesterase conjugate (conjugate tracer) for a limited amount of corticosterone antiserum. Because the concentration of the corticosterone varies, the amount of corticosterone tracer that binds to the corticosterone antiserum is inversely proportional to the concentration of corticosterone in the well. This antiserum-corticosterone (either free or tracer) complex binds to the mouse anti-rabbit IgG that has been previously attached to the well. The plate is washed to remove any unbound reagents and then Ellman's reagent is added to the well. The product of this enzymatic reaction has a distinct yellow color and absorbs strongly at 412 nm. The intensity of this color, determined spectrophotometrically, is proportional to the amount of corticosterone tracer bound to the well, which is inversely proportional to the amount of free corticosterone present in the well during the incubation. The assay has a range of 8.2&#x02013;5000 pg/ml and a sensitivity of approximately 30 pg/ml. NC, HSC, PC, and TC birds were alternated for blood collection, and their blood was taken at the same time of the day (i.e., between 0800 and 1000 h) to decrease data variability of serum corticosterone levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Assessment of zootechnical parameters</title><p>The chicks in the individual pen were observed for mortality, three times a day throughout the experimental period.

Feed intake was calculated by subtracting the amount of left-over feed from the total amount of feed offered per replicate, and it was measured on day 21 and 42. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated as feed intake divided by body weight. The European Production Efficiency Factor (EPEF) was calculated according to the equation: Body weight (kg) &#x000d7; livability (%) &#x000d7; 100/FCR &#x000d7; age (days).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Assessment of cloacal temperature</title><p>On day 21, 28, 35, and 42, the cloacal temperature was recorded from 5 birds per replicate (<italic>n</italic> = 30 per group) during peak temperature of the day (between 1100 and 1500 h) using digital thermometer (Medigold&#x02122;; &#x000b1;0.1&#x000b0;C accuracy) inserted into the cloaca of the birds.

It has been suggested that modern poultry genotypes produce more body heat, due to their greater metabolic activity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, alleviation of stress is essential for maintaining the health, productivity, and reproductive performance in birds. Several methods are available to alleviate the negative effects of high environmental temperature on performance of poultry. However, of the high cost and impracticality of cooling animal buildings, interest on dietary manipulations has increased in recent times.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The propensity for natural anti-stressors is growing because of the global trend of restricting the use of synthetic substances in feed. In pursuit of the above, the present study investigated the anti-stress potential of Phytocee&#x02122;, a novel polyherbal formulation using a heat stress model as it is one of the well-recognized and widely used models to study the stress in broilers. In addition, the study also aimed at evaluation of efficacy of Phytocee&#x02122; in comparison with Vitamin C and at elucidation of the possible mechanism for anti-stress activity of Phytocee&#x02122; on alleviation of heat stress.</p><p>In the present study, the chronic heat stress model was employed for comparative evaluation of Phytocee&#x02122; and Vitamin C; the stress was induced in chicks by exposing them to high temperature (34&#x000b0;C&#x02013;36&#x000b0;C) for 8 h per day from day 8 to day 42. The chicks were subjected to heat stress from day 8 because the broiler chick seems anatomically complete after hatching, but thermoregulatory systems need further development and maturation and become fully homeotherm about 7 days after hatching.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Moreover, the heat stress during the 1<sup>st</sup> week may lead to greater adaptability to high temperatures due to high metabolic rate of broiler chickens[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and may not cause changes in markers of stress such as corticosterone, H:L ratio, and cloacal temperature.</p><p>The heat stress or any kind of homeostatic disturbances alter the activity of the neuroendocrine system of poultry, resulting in activation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis; it is an important system for integration of body functions and activation of which causes release of Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from anterior pituitary and subsequent elevation in plasma corticosterone levels and deterioration of the health status of animals.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Broilers with elevated corticosterone levels have demonstrated a depressed lymphocyte numbers culminating in a higher H:L ratio.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The concentration of blood corticosterone and H:L ratio are the most sensitive indicators of stress in broilers[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and are commonly used as tools to measure the physiological stress. Gross and Siegel[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that H:L ratio only measures the physiological change but the concentration of blood corticosteroids alters before physiological change occurs and concluded that the H:L ratio and the concentration of glucocorticoids are the better measure of long-term changes and short-term changes, respectively, in the environment. The results of the present study indicate that exposure of broilers to high temperature induced a long-term heat stress; as a consequence, there was activation of HPA axis followed by a significant elevation in both serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio, whereas supplementation of Phytocee&#x02122; and Vitamin C in the diet was shown to restore the serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio toward normal. However, inhibitory effect of Phytocee&#x02122; on serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio was statistically significant as compared to HSC, superior to Vitamin C and comparable to NC. Hence, the present study clearly indicates that Phytocee&#x02122; could modulate HPA-induced stimulation of corticosterone release and subsequent elevation in blood H:L ratio. In contrary to earlier report, our study findings suggest that both serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio were significantly increased in heat stress and could be used as reliable measures of chronic stress in broiler chickens.</p><p>The corticosterone is the principal glucocorticoid involved in the regulation of feed intake, body weight gain, relative immune organ weight, and innate immunity in poultry.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] The chronic heat stress is reported to cause a significant reduction in feed intake, body weight, higher FCR,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and a higher mortality rates in broilers.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The supplementation of Vitamin C aids in attenuation of elevated corticosterone level and H:L ratio[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and improves the body weight in broilers exposed to heat stress.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] In the present study, the elevated serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio observed in HSC displayed a significant negative impact on body weight, body weight gain, feed intake, and mortality rate, whereas the supplementation of Phytocee&#x02122; or Vitamin C was able to reverse the heat stress-induced serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio, thereby restoring the body weight and FCR. This result also corroborates with Attia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] who reported the feeding of Vitamin C to heat-stressed birds, relieves the undesirable effect, and improves the feed intake, protein digestibility, dressing percentage, and FCR. In addition, Phytocee&#x02122; group exhibited a lower mortality rate than Vitamin C group (1.33% vs. 2.00%) suggesting a possible immunomodulatory effect attributable to the bioactive compounds present in the Phytocee&#x02122;.</p><p>Beside serum corticosterone and H:L ratio, the cloacal temperature is also one of the indices used to evaluate the degree of heat stress in broilers, reflecting the core body temperature;[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] it will be altered when the thermoregulatory mechanisms of birds are compromised. The supplementation of Vitamin C was reported to decrease the cloacal temperature and ameliorate the ability of the birds to discern higher heat loads in broiler chickens during the heat stress.[<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] Moreover, the optimum recommended dose of Vitamin C was found to be 100&#x02013;200 ppm for broilers under stress conditions such as beak trimming, disease, and heat stress.[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] In the present study, HSC group presented a statistically significant increase in cloacal temperature on days 21, 28, 35, and 42 indicating that the thermoregulatory mechanism of the birds was adversely challenged, apparently due to heat stress and concomitant increase in metabolic rate. Furthermore, supplementation of Phytocee&#x02122; caused a reduction in cloacal temperature on all time points, but statistical significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) was observed on days 28 and 42. Although Vitamin C supplementation reduced the cloacal temperature on all time points, statistical significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was noticed only on day 28. It signifies that Phytocee&#x02122; supplementation is comparable or relatively superior to Vitamin C in alleviation of body temperature toward normal in broilers during heat stress. These findings are in line with previous reports wherein supplementation of Vitamin C was reported to reduce the rectal and skin temperatures as well as oxygen consumption in heat-stressed birds.[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</p><p>Phytocee&#x02122; is an unique polyherbal formulation containing <italic>W. somnifera</italic>, <italic>O. sanctum</italic>, and <italic>E. officinalis</italic>. <italic>O. sanctum</italic> was reported to improve body weight in immunosuppressed birds through enhancing the immune status[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and displayed an anti-stress effect by directly inhibiting cortisol secretions and indirectly having an antagonist effect on CRHR1 receptor.[<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] Similarly, <italic>E. officinalis</italic> and <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were also known to improve the body weight and FCR in broilers attributable to anabolic effect[<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and possess an anti-stress effect and antioxidant activities.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] These findings strongly indicate that improvement in body weight and FCR of Phytocee&#x02122; supplemented group could be attributed to its anti-stress effect.</p><p>The results of the present study also indicates, for the first time, that the polyherbal formulation Phytocee&#x02122; has tendency to decrease the cloacal temperature of the broiler chickens possibly through modulating the thermoregulatory mechanisms. Phytocee&#x02122; was shown to decrease the serum corticosterone level and H:L ratio probably by modulating the HPA axis and having an antagonist effect on CRHR1 receptor that could have contributed to its anti-stress effect and further improvement in zootechnical parameters in broilers exposed to heat stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Phytocee&#x02122; demonstrated an anti-stress effect in the current study by ameliorating the negative effects of heat stress on zootechnical parameters, serum corticosterone, H:L ratio, and cloacal temperature of broilers through modulating the HPA axis and thermoregulatory mechanism. Hence, Phytocee&#x02122; could be recommended in broilers and livestock animals for modulating and combating adverse effects and thereby reducing the economic losses incurred by farmers due to heat stress. However, the phytoactives of Phytocee&#x02122; are yet to be explored, and further investigations are required at molecular level to elucidate the concrete mechanism of action of Phytocee&#x02122; on alleviation of heat stress in broiler chickens.</p><sec id="sec2-17"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of
