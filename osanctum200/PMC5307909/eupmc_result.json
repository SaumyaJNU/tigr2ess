    "The present study evaluated the effect of ethanolic extract of Nardostachys jatamansi roots (NJet) on MYCN mediated regulation of expression of MDM2 and p53 proteins in neuroblastoma cell lines, IMR-32 and SK-N-MC.The effect of NJet on cell viability was determined by MTT; and on growth kinetics was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion method and soft agar assay. The expression of p53, MDM2 and MYCN proteins in response to NJet treatment was evaluated by immunoblotting.NJet decreased the viability of neuroblastoma cells without affecting the viability of non-cancerous, HEK-293 cells. It altered the growth kinetics of the cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. NJet down regulated the expression of MYCN and MDM2 proteins with a simultaneous increase in the expression of tumor suppressor protein p53.The present data demonstrated that NJet regulated the growth of IMR-32 and SK-N-MC through reduction in MYCN expression that lead to down regulation of MDM2 protein and increase in p53 expression. These preliminary results warrant further in depth studies to explore the therapeutic potential of Nardostachys jatamansi in the management of neuroblastoma.NJet reduced the viability of human neuroblastoma cell lines without affecting the viability of non-cancerous, HEK-293 cells.NJet regulated the growth kinetics of the cancer cells.NJet decreased the expression of MYCN and MDM2 proteins and simultaneously increased the expression of tumor suppressor protein p53. Abbreviation used: NJet: Ethanolic extract of Nardostachys jatamansi MTT: 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide HPTLC: High performance thin layer chromatography."
