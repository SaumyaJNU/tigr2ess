    "The protein/isozyme fingerprint is useful in differentiating the species and acts as a biochemical marker for identification and systematic studies of medicinal plant species.In the present study, protein and isozyme profiles for peroxidase, esterase, acid phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase of five species of Memecylon (Melastomataceae), Memecylon umbellatum, Memecylon edule, Memecylon talbotianum, Memecylon malabaricum, and Memecylon wightii were investigated.Fresh leaves were used to prepare crude enzyme extract for analyzing the five enzymes isozyme variations. Separation of isozymes was carried out using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the banding patterns of protein were scored. Pair-wise comparisons of genotypes, based on the presence or absence of unique and shared polymorphic products, were used to regenerate similarity coefficients. The similarity coefficients were then used to construct dendrograms, using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages.A total of 50 bands with various Rf values and molecular weight were obtained through PAGE analysis. Among the five Memecylon species, more number of bands was produced in M. wightii and less number of bands was observed in M. edule. The results of similarity indices grouped M. malabaricum and M. wightii in one cluster with 98% similarity and M. umbellatum, M. edule, and M. talbotianum are grouped in another cluster with 79% similarity showing close genetic similarities which is in accordance with the morphological identification of Memecylon species.The protein/isozyme fingerprint is useful in differentiating the species and acts as a biochemical marker for identification of Memecylon species.Biochemical characterization of Memecylon species was evaluated by SDS-PAGE of extracted protein and isozyme profiling on native PAGE.After electrophoresis, each gel was stained with specific stains. Genetic distance relationships were evaluated based on the banding patterns of protein on isozymes.Unique banding pattern of esterase, peroxidase, acid phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase and polyphenol oxidase are observed in all the five species of Memecylon, which represent the fingerprint of Memecylon species.SDS-PAGE and isozyme profiling of five Memecylon species revealed that M. malabaricum and M. wightii grouped in one cluster and M. umbellatum, M. edule and M. talbotianum grouped in another cluster showing close genetic similarities which is in accordance with the morphological identification of Memecylon species.This is the first report on the comparison of protein and isozyme profile of five different Memecylon species.
