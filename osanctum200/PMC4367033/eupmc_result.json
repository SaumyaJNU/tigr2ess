    "BACKGROUND:This study evaluated the antioxidant potential of a polyherbal formulation (Phytocee(™)) in the rodent model. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Four groups of rats (n = 6) were pretreated with Vitamin C (20 mg/kg) or Phytocee(™) (20, 100, and 200 mg/kg), respectively for 10 days. Oxidative stress in rat liver was induced by administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at 2 ml/kg as a single dose orally to all groups except the vehicle control group. After 24 h of administration of CCl4, hepatic levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated. RESULTS:Phytocee(™) administered groups at all the dose levels significantly reduced the hepatic MDA, serum ALT and AST levels with a marked increase in hepatic SOD and catalase as compared with CCl4 treated group. CONCLUSION:The findings suggest that Phytocee(™) markedly reversed the effects of CCl4 induced oxidative stress and can be used as an antioxidant feed supplement."
