    "Oxitard, a polyherbal formulation comprising the extracts of Withania somnifera, Mangifera indica, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Daucus carota, Vitis vinifera, powders of Syzygium aromaticum, Yashada bhasma and Emblica officinalis; and oils of Triticum sativum.Current study deals with the assessment of Oxitard (a marketed polyherbal formulation) for its adaptogenic potential in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and chronic stress (CS) induced dysfunctional homeostasis in rodents.Animals were immobilized for 2 h every day for ten days to induce CS. In order to induce CUS, animals were employed in a battery of stressors of variable value and duration for ten days. Following administration of Oxitard, stress was induced in the animals. Stress-induced efficient changes were evaluated by assessing organ (adrenal gland) weights, ulcer index, hematological parameters and biochemical levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and catalase (CAT).CS and CUS significantly modified the oxidative stress parameters (increased MDA and decreased GSH). Furthermore, CS and CUS lead to weight reduction, adrenal hypertrophy and gastric ulceration. Pre-treatment with Oxitard (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly modified CS and CUS induced hematological changes, oxidative stress parameters and pathological effects.In conclusion, Oxitard-intervened antioxidant actions are accountable for its adaptogenic effects in stress-induced dysfunctional homeostasis."
