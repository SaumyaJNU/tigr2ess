Abstract</div> <div class="background:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background:</div> <p>Preparation of highly standardized herbal products with respect to chemical composition and biological activity is considered to be a valuable approach in this field. SJT-DI-02 polyherbal formulation was successfully developed at our institute and filed for patent at Mumbai patent office. </p> </div> <div class="objective:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Objective:</div> <p>The present work was marker based standardization of patented, novel and efficacious polyherbal formulation namely SJT-DI-02 for the treatment of diabetes. The SJT-DI-02 was comprised of dried extracts of rhizomes of <i>Acorus calamus</i>, leaves of <i>Aegle marmelose</i>, fruits of <i>Benincasa hispida</i>, roots of <i>Chlorophytum arendinaceum</i>, seeds of <i>Eugenia jambolana</i>, leaves of <i>Ocimum sanctum</i>, pericarp of <i>Punica granatum</i>, seeds of Tamarindus indica. Selected plants were collected, dried and extracted with suitable solvents. The formulation was prepared by mixing different fractions of extracts. </p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and Methods:</div> <p>For successful and best standardization, first of all selection and procurement was carried out. Selection is done on the basis of therapeutic efficacy and amount of the marker present in the particular plant part. At the time of procurement side by side phytochemical screening and estimation of phytoconstituents was carried out. After completion of preliminary screening using characterized markers, we tried to develop best TLC systems using selected solvent composition. Finally well-developed TLC systems were applied in HPTLC. In the present study polyherbal formulation was standardized by using different four markers. TLC Densitometric methods were developed using HPTLC for the quantification of these marker compounds. Solvent systems were optimized to achieve best resolution of the marker compounds from other components of the sample extract. The identity of the bands in the sample extracts were confirmed by comparing the R <sub>f</sub> and the absorption spectra by overlaying their UV absorption spectra with those of their respective standards. The purity of the bands due to marker compounds in the sample extracts were confirmed by overlaying the absorption spectra recorded at start, middle and end position of the band in the sample tracks. After conforming all these things fingerprints were developed for all three formulations which will be act as authentification and quality control tool. </p> </div> <div class="results:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results:</div> <p>% w/w of asarones is 3.61, % w/w of marmelosin is 4.60, % w/w of gallic acid is 10.80 and % w/w of lupeol is 4.13. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of quantification and accuracy. In well-developed mobile phase system linearity was found to be in the range of 0.983-0.995, % recovery was found to be in the range of 97.48-99.63, % RSD for intraday and interday was found to be 0.13- 0.70 and 0.32 -1.41 and LOD and LOQ was found to be in the range of 0.15- 0.61 and 0.45 -1.83 microgram per ml. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion:</div> <p>Thus High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) methods were developed and validated in terms of linearity, precision, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of quantification and accuracy. The methods were rapid, sensitive, reproducible and economical. It does not suffer any positive or negative interference due to common other component present in the formulation and would also serve as a tool for authentication of herbal products containing marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol and asarones. Thus this work provides standardized and therapeutically active polyherbal formulations for the different ailments. </p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

SJT-DI-02</div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <p>In India, currently 50.8 million peoples are estimated to be suffering from diabetes. Further projections indicate that India will have maximum number of diabetic patients by the year 2030.[ <a href="#ref1">1</a>] Currently available drugs having plenty number of side-effects. So in the present scenario, there is usage of safe, efficacious and cheap antidiabetic drug from the plants. Medicinal plants used in the traditional Indian system of medicine are known to produce a variety of compounds with acknowledged therapeutic properties. In the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift from single-target drugs to multi-target polyherbal formulation. </p> <p>Standardization encourages marketing opportunism for polyherbal formulation.[ <a href="#ref2">2</a>] It enables drug companies to claim exclusive patents for processed herbs. Standardization of herbal formulation in terms of raw materials, manufacturing practices and composition is important to ensure quality and optimum level of active principles for their bio potency. Identification of major and unique compounds in herbs as markers and development of analytical methodologies for monitoring them are the key steps involved in marker based standardization.[ <a href="#ref3">3</a>] High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) as a preferred analytical tool for fingerprints and quantification of marker compounds in herbal drugs due to its simplicity, sensitivity, accuracy, suitability for high throughput screening etc.[ <a href="#ref4">4</a>] </p> <p>SJT-DI-02 polyherbal formulation comprising of dried extracts of rhizomes of <i>Acorus calamus</i>, leaves of <i>Aegle marmelose</i>, fruits of <i>Benincasa hispida</i>, roots of <i>Chlorophytum arendinaceum</i>, seeds of <i>Eugenia jambolana</i>, leaves of <i>Ocimum sanctum</i>, pericarps of <i>Punica granatum</i>, seeds of Tamarindus indica. </p> <p>The polyherbal formulation SJT-DI-02 was developed and evaluated for its antidiabetic activity previously. The developed formulation was safe and efficacious.[ <a href="#ref5">5</a>] To makes it available to large pool of patients, it should be standardized. Thus, the present study was aimed to standardize SJT-DI-02 using chemical markers marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol and asarones by HPTLC methods. </p> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Estimation of chemical markers in polyherbal formulations</div> <p>A volume of 35 μl of test solution for marmelosin and asarones, 25 μl of test solution for gallic acid and 50 μl of test solution for lupeol were used for spotting. The plates were developed and dried. For lupeol the plate was derivatized by 5% aqueous H2SO4 and heated at 110°C. The developed plates were scanned at 305 nm (marmelosin), 245 nm (gallic acid), 559 nm (lupeol) and 295 nm (asarones). Peak areas were noted and concentration of markers in the formulation was calculated from the calibration curve. </p> </div> <div class="validationofhptlcmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Validation of HPTLC methods</div> <p>Linearity of the method was evaluated by constructing calibration curves, i.e., peak area versus concentrations, at different concentration levels (1.5-3.5 μg/spot of pure marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol [0.5 mg/ml] and 6-18 μg/spot of asarones [3 mg/ml]) respectively. The results were expressed in terms of correlation co-efficient of the linear regression analysis. Intra-day and inter-day precision were determined by analyzing sample solutions of analyte at three levels covering low, medium and higher concentrations of calibration curve (2-3 μg/spot of pure marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol (0.5 mg/ml) and 9-15 μg/spot of pure asarones (3 mg/ml) respectively for 3 times on the same day and over a period of 3 days. The peak areas obtained were used to calculate mean and % coefficient variance (CV) values. Repeatability of measurement of peak area and sample application (by analyzing 2.5, μg/spot of pure solution of marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol [0.5 mg/ml] and 12 μg/spot of pure solution of asarones [3 mg/ml]), Recovery experiments were performed by adding three different amounts of standard drug, i.e., 50, 100 and 150% of the drug, to the pre-analyzed formulation (SJT-DI-02) and the resultant is reanalyzed 3 times and %recovery was calculated. The specificity of the method was ascertained by matching of overlain spectra of standard and test formulation. Limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were determined at signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 and 10:1 (3.3 σ/S and 10σ/S) respectively. Determination of the signal to noise ratio was performed by comparing measured signals from samples with known low concentration of analyte can be reliably detected[ <a href="#ref4">4</a>]. </p> </div> </div> <div class="resultsanddiscussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
