In type 2 DM, there is excess sorbitol formation due to increased availability of glucose and sorbitol gets accumulated in insulin- sensitive tissues like lens, nerves, retina leading to cataract, retinopathy, and neuropathy. AR-inhibitors prevent the conversion of glucose to sorbitol and are capable of controlling diabetic complications.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Limited literature data and molecular docking analysis in terms of binding energy have shown that natural bio-molecules such as quercetin, quercitrin, myricitrin, coumarins, monoterpenes, and stilbenes are potent AR inhibitors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Enzyme ACE is associated with hypertension, a long-term complication of diabetes. ACE activates angiotensin-I into a potent vasoconstrictor called angiotensin-II.

DPP-4 rapidly deactivates GLP-1. Phyto-molecules, mostly triterpenoids, steroids, and phenolic constituents with DPP-4 inhibitory activity, help to increase the levels of endogenous active GLP-1 and act as an important therapeutic compound against type 2 DM, the fact being further supported by molecular docking studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) like singlet oxygen or various radicals is detrimental for anabolic activities and ROS-induced oxidative damages to cellular tissues leading to diseases like cancer, chorionic villous sampling, nephropathy, and aging.

Solvents like ethyl acetate being less polar gives low extraction yield and those with higher polarity like ethanol and methanol, or their hydroalcoholic solutions will give higher extraction yields.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>The quantitative yield of polyphenols and flavonoids follows a descending order from hydro-ethanolic extracts, hydro-methanolic extracts, and aqueous extracts. However, there is an appreciable increase in polyphenol and flavonoid content amongst the composites of the three species blended in different ratios [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], and the hydro-ethanolic extract of the composite (1:1:2) showed highest polyphenol and flavonoid content.</p><p>For <italic>in-vitro</italic> explorations of NEIs amongst the leaves of three plant species, it was found that hydro-ethanolic extracts in all cases gave higher IC50 values, thus, showing greater effectivity. Composites, whether aqueous extracts, hydro-methanolic, or hydro-ethanolic showed synergistic inhibitory actions; the appreciable one being 1:1:2 followed by 1:1:1.</p><p>Prior research suggested a strong positive correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99) between phenolic content and anti-oxidative potential.[<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] Polyphenols can prevent damage from ROS through radical scavenging or prevent the generation of these species by iron chelation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref><xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref><xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] Polyphenols also bind and inhibit the enzymes &#x003b1;-amylase and &#x003b1;-glucosidase.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref><xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref><xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] Polyphenols have also shown to facilitate insulin response and attenuate secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1. Other suggested mechanisms for the hypoglycemic actions of polyphenols were down regulation of the expression of liver glucokinase, upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), induction of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and enhancing peripheral glucose utilization by stimulating glucose transporter subtype 4, etc.[<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref><xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref><xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]</p><p>Flavonoids inhibit the ACE enzyme by generating chelate complexes within the active center of ACE.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Flavonoids were found to attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate and PEPCK, subsequently improving glycemic control.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Our research data are in accordance with this phenomenon. A strong correlation was found between polyphenol (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.81&#x02013;0.92) and flavonoid contents (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.57&#x02013;0.99) with the anti-oxidative and enzyme inhibitory potentials of the extracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>NEIs can serve as an important therapeutic tool against type 2 DM. The current research aims to provide the state-of-the-art of search of NEIs amongst three species of Indian medicinal plants by <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays which can be further utilized for bioactivity-guided isolations of such enzyme inhibitors. Further development of polyherbal composites and achieving phyto-synergistic actions was another goal of the work. Our research results showed the multi-dimensional hypoglycemic potential of the three species of Indian medicinal plants for future exploitations in phytotherapy of type 2 DM. However, extensive pharmacology and toxicological studies in animal and human models are further warranted.</p><sec id="sec2-23"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-24"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>ABOUT AUTHORS</title><fig id="F4" position="float"><caption><p>Dr. Analava Mitra</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PM-11-522-g013"/></fig><p><bold>Dr. Analava Mitra</bold>, MBBS, PhD is currently the Associate Professor of School of Medical Science and Technology, IIT Kharagpur.
