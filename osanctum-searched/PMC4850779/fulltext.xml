Both of these viruses are RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hepatitis A infection is caused largely due to faeco-oral transmission. Contaminated food including milk, some fruits such as raspberry and even shellfish has been implicated as the causative agents. Improper personal hygiene of people living in a congested, overcrowded locality only compound the problem.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Hepatitis E also has a similar mode of spread as that of Hepatitis A, however a person to person contact is rare in the case of Hepatitis E.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is generally known to occur in those individuals who are immune to a Hepatitis A infection, since they had it in the past. Another issue of concern is that an infection of Hepatitis E during pregnancy can lead to acute liver failure. This has disastrous consequences with such patients having a high rate of mortality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>There is no specific treatment available for infective hepatitis in biomedicine. There are no antiviral drugs which can alleviate a patient's symptoms, and since this condition is self-limiting, most physicians advocate rest to their patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The primary author of this article had the misfortune of getting affected by both the variants of Infective hepatitis over a short span. On both occasions he was advised rest by his physician colleagues. The immense nausea, discomfort and the overall agony experienced by him was the trigger to the present article.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>HEPATITIS AND AYURVEDA</title><p>A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted employing the following search terms: (Treatment of hepatitis) AND (Ayurveda). There were no restrictions on the date of publication. The search was performed on 16<sup>th</sup> June 2015. A total of 27 articles were revealed by the search. The abstracts of these 27 articles were studied and 16 relevant papers were selected which commented specifically upon the treatment of hepatitis. These 16 papers were reviewed in detail and the following short report was written.</p><p>Chturvedi <italic>et al</italic>., in their clinical study on <italic>Kalmegh</italic> (Skt. <italic>Bh&#x0016b;nimba</italic>, <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> Nees) have reported an 80% cure rate in the study population suffering from infective hepatitis. A significant decrease in the liver enzymes was noted in all these patients who were administered <italic>Kalmegh</italic> in the form of a decoction.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Keche <italic>et al</italic>., conducted a randomised double blind placebo controlled clinical trial. This was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a polyherbal preparation called Livwin, in patients suffering from acute viral hepatitis. They have stated that this drug gives good results in those patients who suffer from uncomplicated cases of hepatitis. Adverse effects of epigastric distress and diarrhoea were reported with this drug treatment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Naturally occurring substances such as fruits or by products of certain insects such as honey produced by bees have also been shown to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of hepatitis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Eugenia <italic>Jambolana</italic> (Skt. <italic>Jambu</italic>, <italic>Jamun</italic>), is commonly found in the tropical countries such as India. It has anti-oxidant properties. Donepudi <italic>et al</italic>., report a study conducted on mice with hepatic damage induced in them following bile duct ligation. They were thereafter administered an extract prepared from the <italic>Jamun</italic> fruit. Subsequently the authors have documented that the hepatic inflammation induced in rats due to the bile duct ligation was reduced by the <italic>Jamun</italic> fruit extract (JFE). Suppression of lipid peroxidation was postulated to be the main hepatoprotective effect. Other important findings noted were reduction of macrophage infiltration, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen substances found after bile duct ligation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The fruit extract of Long pepper (piper longum) has been shown to have hepatoprotective action. In a study conducted on rodents with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), induced liver damage, the extract was shown to restrict ongoing liver fibrosis. This action resulted in stimulation of regeneration of the cells. However there was no protective effect against cirrhosis of liver or acute liver damage. The most abundant component isolated from this plant is called Piperine. It's mechanism of action is reduction of lipid peroxidation, by which it offers a hepatoprotective effect.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The medicinal value of bee's honey has been vividly mentioned in ancient texts. The <italic>Caraka Sa&#x01e43;hit&#x00101;</italic> mentions four different types of honey viz. <italic>m&#x00101;k&#x01e63;ik</italic>a, <italic>bhr&#x00101;mara</italic>, <italic>k&#x01e63;audra</italic> and <italic>paittaka</italic>, whereas the <italic>Su&#x0015b;ruta Sa&#x01e43;hit&#x00101;</italic> mentions eight different types of honey namely pauttika, <italic>bhr&#x00101;mara</italic>, <italic>k&#x01e63;audra</italic>, <italic>m&#x00101;k&#x01e63;ika</italic>, <italic>chatra</italic>, <italic>arghya</italic>, <italic>audd&#x00101;laka</italic> and <italic>dala madhu</italic>. Of these, the best type is <italic>m&#x00101;k&#x01e63;ika</italic> which is produced by the honey bee which is of red colour. A mixture of 15 ml of honey with 120 ml of <italic>Adhathoda vasica</italic>, given twice daily has been recommended as a treatment for jaundice.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The medicinal importance of <italic>Tulas&#x0012b;</italic> (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> Linn) has been well documented in ancient Indian literature. This amazing plant has a substance called adaptogen, which is known to counteract multiple nonspecific stresses. Mondal <italic>et al</italic>., in their study noticed enhanced physical endurance and improved healing in rodents that were fed with an ethanol extract of <italic>Tulas&#x0012b;</italic>. The extract was prepared by drying the whole plant. This ethanol extract was also shown to have a hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Dange <italic>et al</italic>., studied the efficacy of an Ayurvedic medication called <italic>Arogyavardhini</italic>, on rats that had CCl4 induced hepatic damage. <italic>Arogyavardhini</italic> consists of the following ingredients in a 200 mg tablet, 1 part each of mercury, sulphur, <italic>lohabhasma</italic>, <italic>t&#x00101;mrabhasma</italic> and <italic>abhrakabhasma</italic>; 2 parts of <italic>Triphal&#x00101; c&#x0016b;r&#x01e47;a</italic> (<italic>Terminalia chebula</italic>, <italic>Terminalia bellerica and Phyllanthus emblica</italic>); 3 parts of <italic>Shilajit</italic> (Skt. <italic>&#x0015a;il&#x00101;jatu</italic>); 4 parts of <italic>Guggulu</italic> (Commiphora mukul); 18 parts of <italic>Ku&#x01e6d;ak&#x0012b;</italic> (Picrorhiza kurroa) and 72 parts of the decoction of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>. They noted that the group treated with <italic>Arogyavardhini</italic> not only had a less marked rise in the liver enzymes but also had a much subdued histopathological picture with less severity of degenerative and necrotic tissue. The authors of this study could not conclusively state as to which ingredient of <italic>Arogyavardhini</italic> was hepatoprotective but postulated that it could be <italic>Picrorhiza kurroa</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Vaidya <italic>et al</italic>., in their study on the hepatoprotective effect of <italic>Picrorhiza kurroa</italic> have shown significant results in the rats that had galactosamine induced liver injury. This study emphasises the need of standardization of the active agent picroside in the medications prepared from <italic>Picrorhiza kurroa</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Liv. 52 is a commonly available over-the-counter medication for liver ailments. This drug is prescribed by almost all Ayurvedic physicians at some point in their practice. Mandal and Roy studied the role of Liv. 52 in cases of acute viral (infective) hepatitis. Among the patients treated by them, 73% had good results, 23% had fair and only 3% had poor results.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a recent placebo controlled study, Katiyar <italic>et al</italic>., state that the polyherbal formulation, New Livfit<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (NLF) has been shown to clear the viral load of Hepatitis B (HBV-DNA) sooner in patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). This drug however had no effect on the kidney disease of the patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Buwa <italic>et al</italic>., in their study on <italic>Abhraka Bhasma</italic>, attribute the hepatoprotective property of this compound to it being a derivative of mica. Silica which is known to be a free radical scavenger is one of the constituents of mica. <italic>Abhraka Bhasma</italic> is supposedly thought to exert free radical scavenging and hepatoprotective effect because of its peculiar composition.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>As the saying goes, &#x02018;There are two sides to every story&#x02019;. We also find a recent study which has criticised Ayurvedic medicines. Bunchorntavakul and Reddy in their study state that a high content of metals in Ayurvedic medicines is a major causative factor for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Liv. 52 which was reported by Mandal and Roy to have a good effect in their patients,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] has been reported to have a higher rate of mortality in patients suffering from alcoholic cirrhosis. Surprisingly enough, while on one hand this study criticises Ayurvedic medicine, its authors also acknowledge the fact that the reported prevalence of hepatotoxicity is extremely less, about 1.3% in India, where these drugs are used the most.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>A recent study done by Manvar <italic>et al</italic>., on Eclipta Alba (<italic>Bh&#x01e5b;&#x01e45;gar&#x00101;ja</italic>), evaluates the action of this traditional compound on Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Their study identified three active phytochemical compounds in Eclipta Alba. These were Wedelolactone, Luteolin and Apigenin. These potent compounds inhibited HCV replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell culture. Moreover when these compounds are combined, they show a synergistic activity in inhibiting HCV replication.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma as a long term complication of hepatitis is well documented. A recent study has revealed that <italic>Tridham</italic> (TD) might have a role to play in the treatment of Hepatocellular carcinoma. This medication has been known for years by the practitioners of the Siddha system of medicine. &#x02018;<italic>Tri</italic>&#x02019; means three and as the name implies, <italic>Tridham</italic> consists of three plant ingredients viz. seed coat of <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> (<italic>T. chebula</italic>), fruit of <italic>Elaeocarpus ganitrus</italic> (<italic>E. ganitrus</italic>) and leaves of <italic>Prosopis cineraria</italic> (<italic>P. cineraria</italic>) in equal proportions. <italic>Tridham</italic> is believed to bring about a programmed cell death, so called &#x02018;apoptosis&#x02019; in the cancer cells responsible for Hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanism of action is via the action of the caspase cascade. This act is independent of the expression of the p53 gene.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-3"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ayurvedic medicine definitely has a lot to offer to the society by way of improving liver health and this is quite evident from the various studies reported in literature. However certain studies have raised questions as to whether Ayurvedic medicines are worthwhile. We believe that apart from conducting more evidence based clinical research in Ayurvedic medicine, the need of the hour is to educate the masses about the rich heritage of Ayurveda. That day may not be too far away when Ayurvedic medication might answer some of the most difficult questions faced by the modern day physician.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dienstag</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Longo</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Fauci</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasper</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jameson</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute viral hepatitis</article-title><source>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine</source><year>2012</year><edition>18th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Printed in the United States of America</publisher-loc><publisher-name>The McGraw Hill Companies Inc</publisher-name><fpage>2537</fpage><lpage>57</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anstee</surname><given-names>QM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>DEJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Longo</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Fauci</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasper</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Jameson</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Loscalzo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Liver and biliary tract disease</article-title><source>Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine</source><year>2014</year><edition>22nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>London, United Kingdom</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier Health Sciences</publisher-name><fpage>948</fpage><lpage>55</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chturvedi</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomar</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiwari</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical studies on kalmegh (andrographis paniculata nees) in infective hepatitis</article-title><source>Anc Sci Life</source><year>1983</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>208</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22556984</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keche</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Badar</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Hardas</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and safety of livwin (polyherbal formulation) in patients with acute viral hepatitis: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>Int J Ayurveda Res</source><year>2010</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>216</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21455448</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Donepudi</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>Aleksunes</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Driscoll</surname><given-names>MV</given-names></name><name><surname>Seeram</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name><name><surname>Slitt</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The traditional ayurvedic medicine, <italic>Eugenia jambolana</italic> (Jamun fruit), decreases liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis during cholestasis</article-title><source>Liver Int</source><year>2012</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>560</fpage><lpage>73</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22212619</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ediriweera</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Premarathna</surname><given-names>NY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Medicinal and cosmetic uses of Bee's honey &#x02013;
