To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study reporting the efficacy and safety of this combined Syferol-IHP and triple therapy schedule.

The drug compliance was checked before the follow-up test. Any patient found to be developing complications such as perforation and bleeding were discontinued from the study and were given appropriate treatment.

However, rapid recovery was seen, with the reduction in all incidences of epigastric pain at least 4 weeks after randomization, and without significant differences in adverse events. Therefore, significant differences were recorded for the disappearance of epigastric pain (NNT=3.7) and healing of the ulcer and rate of gastritis (NNT=3.6) and gastric ulcer (NNT=1.7) but not duodenitis (NNT=4.0) or duodenal ulcer (NNT=3.0) in the Syferol-IHP in combination with triple therapy group compared with the triple therapy and placebo groups.</p><p>The primary endpoint of our study, healing of gastric ulcer confirmed by endoscopy 4 weeks after the commencement of treatment, was significantly better in patients receiving Syferol-IHP than in patients receiving placebo, although the healing of duodenal ulcer did not show significant difference between the two groups. It is important to note that the overall effects of Syferol-IHP appear to have high predilection to gastric mucosa than duodenal mucosa. The <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication at the follow-up endoscopy-directed biopsy was 100% with Syferol-IHP population and 50% with placebo population (<italic>P</italic>=0.066). These findings were comparable to previous study by Delchier et al<xref rid="b19-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in multi-European countries involving quadruple therapy. In a comparable prospective non-randomized study involving quadruple therapy in Italy, 95% of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients were successfully treated, although our present study was a randomized control trial in design but with lower sample size.<xref rid="b5-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Previous studies have indicated the positive effect of VCO on ulcer healing in animal models.<xref rid="b9-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Findings of study by Anosike and Obidoa<xref rid="b9-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and Nneli and Woyike<xref rid="b12-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> indicated that VCO plays an important cytoprotective role in gastric and duodenal ulcer diseases. Previous studies have also revealed the synergistic effects of <italic>O. sanctum</italic> oil, which is basil oil used as flavoring liquor for VCO. Akin to VCO, <italic>O. sanctum</italic> oil has been reported to have antibacterial and antiulcerogenic properties.<xref rid="b13-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Our study has also revealed that in all the study populations, the prevalence of gastric ulcer was 20%, which was equal to the prevalence of duodenal ulcer of 20%. These findings are in great contrast to results of previous epidemiological studies conducted in Europe, which showed a prevalence of 4.1% (gastric ulcer 2% and duodenal ulcer 2.1%)<xref rid="b21-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> to 6.2% (gastric ulcer 2.3% and duodenal ulcers 3.9%),<xref rid="b22-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> with the prevalence of gastric ulcers in all these studies being less than duodenal ulcer or higher than duodenal ulcer. Also, in a systematic review by Li et al,<xref rid="b23-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the prevalence of gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer in China was 1.6% and 13.3%, respectively. The difference could be explained based on the fact that while the previous studies were done in the general population, ours were performed in patients with dyspeptic symptoms referred for endoscopy. This explanation is plausible because in one recent study involving only women with PUD diagnosed endoscopically, the prevalence of gastric ulcer was 55.5% and that of duodenal ulcer was 45.5%.<xref rid="b24-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in patients with peptic ulcer in Nigeria would be expected to approach 100%. However, in our case, more than 50% of the patients were negative for the infection. In fact, a previous Nigeria study by Jemilohun et al<xref rid="b25-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> that relied on biopsy-based method (similar to our index study) revealed that the diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was made in only 64% of patients. Another study by Olokoba et al<xref rid="b26-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> revealed a prevalence rate of 80.0% using a biopsy-based method. The difference between our findings and those of previous studies could be that women with normal findings at endoscopy were excluded from the study. This reason could be reliable because a previous study by Jemilohun et al showed that 72.2% of the patients who had normal endoscopic findings were <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive.</p><p>In the present study, in terms of the epigastric pain, there was a significant difference between the Syferol-IHP and the placebo groups and the NNT was 3.7. This means that about four patients are needed to be treated with Syferol-IHP and conventional triple therapy for one of them to benefit compared with a conventional triple therapy alone in a clinical trial. Similar reduction outcomes were reported in cases of gastritis and duodenitis but that of duodenitis did not reach significant levels between the two treatment arms. The statistical significant difference seen in both groups with respect to the disappearance of epigastric pain and the healing of ulcer and rate of gastritis could be due to synergistic effect of the antibacterial and anti-ulcer properties of Syferol-IHP and triple regimen combination. Therefore, this paves way for a proposal of making Syferol-IHP an important addition to the regular triple therapy regimen in patients with gastritis and gastric ulcerations.</p><p>In view of these findings, a treatment concept that combines Syferol-IHP and triple therapy, as evaluated in the present study, appears to be associated with a superior clinical outcome, although a number of factors have to be taken into account, which may have an impact on patient clinical outcome, such as geographical regions, previously failed triple therapy, resistance issues, and different diagnostic tool opportunities. For instance, triple therapy containing clarithromycin but not metronidazole appears to be the most prescribed therapy in the study population and there could be high occurrence of clarithromycin-resistant <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains, which could justify the quadruple therapy.<xref rid="b20-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Also, considering the apparently noncompliance rate of PUD therapy in the study population, we decided to use Pylorest (three-in-one tablet) to avoid any risk of failure of compliance to therapy during the course of the study.<xref rid="b20-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Again, none of the patients experienced a major adverse event including death, renal or liver damage, or serum lipid profile abnormalities during therapy.<xref rid="b27-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These abnormal changes were not observed in the present study, indicating that the study products appear to be safe.</p><p>Our findings have some strengths. First, this is the first randomized controlled study confirming that the use of this new quadruple therapy involving Syferol-IHP and triple therapy was effective. Therefore, Syferol-IHP is a combined natural product therapy, which suggests synergism in effective management of the PUD.<xref rid="b16-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, we found that this therapeutic quadruple regimen is always effective, both as ulcer therapy and nonulcer (gastritis, duodenitis) therapy; in both cases, the eradication rate was &#x0003e;95%.</p><p>The second strength of our study is the safety of the treatment regimen. Adverse events were reported in 8.3% of the enrolled patients and none of the patients had to discontinue the treatment due to adverse effects. These findings were lower than findings of Delchier et al,<xref rid="b19-ceg-12-021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which reported mild adverse effects in 67% of patients. However, cases of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness occurred in our population, but none led to the discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>As a limitation of our study, we did not have a control group without any triple combination therapy because it was considered unethical withholding conventional therapy in patients with PUD without any prior randomized trial comparing the use of Syferol-IHP for the treatment of PUD. We therefore compared patients receiving Syferol-IHP and triple therapy and patients receiving placebo and triple therapy. The results of the present study are to be considered as preliminary or pilot, to be confirmed in larger patient cohorts. Some patients may have been over treated because all patients with the diagnosis of PUD at endoscopy received <italic>H. pylori</italic> treatment, even though some of them were confirmed to be <italic>H. pylori</italic> free at histology of the biopsied specimen. Thus, <italic>H. pylori</italic> status was an exploratory outcome. Another potential limitation is the nonuse of permutated block randomization pattern, which could not allow us to allocate even number of individuals from both trial arms since the study was stopped after completing the follow-up of 60 participants due to costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study may suggest that Syferol-IHP in combination with conventional triple therapy is more efficacious (produces high cure rates) than conventional triple therapy alone for improving symptoms and signs of PUD. Both treatment arms were equally safe and well tolerated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the study sponsor (Bioresource Development Group, Nigeria) for providing the product (Syferol-IHP) and placebo for this study free of charge.
