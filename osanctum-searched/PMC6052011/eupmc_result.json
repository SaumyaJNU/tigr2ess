    "Persistence of antibacterial drugs for prolonged period in milk increases the probability of antimicrobial resistance progress. Ceftizoxime was found to be excreted in milk for a prolonged period in goats, cows and buffaloes following intravenous injection of ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime. A single dose of ceftriaxone was administered intravenously in healthy control goats (group I) and a single oral dose of the commercial mammary protective polyherbal drug (1.9 gm) was given one hour prior to intravenous ceftriaxone injection in healthy (group II) and induced mastitic (group III) goats to evaluate milk disposition of ceftizoxime following single intravenous dosing of ceftriaxone at 42.25 mg kg-1.Ceftriaxone/ceftizoxime was analyzed by HPLC. The t1/2α and t1/2β values were 14.755 ± 2.733 and 149.079 ± 18.565 hour, respectively indicating prolonged persistence of ceftizoxime in milk. The polyherbal drug increased the milk concentration at later hours and hastened the excretion of ceftizoxime from milk compared to control group. Ceftriaxone could not be detected in milk. The study suggested that adjunct single or repeated therapy of  the polyherbal drug may cause non persistence of ceftriaxone and shorter persistence of ceftizoxime in milk."
