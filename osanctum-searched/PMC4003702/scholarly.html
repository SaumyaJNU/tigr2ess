Abstract</div> <p>Nicotine is a parasympathomimetic alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae) and is a cholinergic drug. It acts directly by stimulating the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors or indirectly by inhibiting cholinesterase, promoting acetylcholine release, or by other mechanisms. 3% of tobacco or one cigarette yields 1 mg of nicotine. As nicotine enters the body, it disturbs the healthy functioning of the body. In this study, we isolated UMNSAH/DF-1 cell line from <i>Gallus gallus</i>. For this, 9 ± 2 day old chicken embryo was taken. This was followed by the extraction of nicotine (1 mg/ml) from cigarette. The cells were then given nicotine stress and were observed for blackening after 24 h of incubation under 40× resolution of microscope. It was found that this blackening of the cells was permanent even after a wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by replenishing the medium. The phytochemicals extracted were from the dried powder, which included <i>Curcuma longa</i> (薑黃 Jiāng Huáng; Turmeric) 40 mg/ml, <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (neem) 50 mg/ml, <i>Cinnamomum tamala</i> (bay leaf) 30 mg/ml, <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (綠茶 Lǜ Chá; Green Tea) 100 mg/ml, and <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> (tulsi) 30 mg/ml. When applied to nicotine-stressed cells, it was observed that ursolic acid in neem recovered 70%, followed by 65% recovery by tulsi (having triterpenoid), 50% recovery by the catechins in <i>Ca. sinensis</i>, and very little recovery shown by <i>Ci. tamala</i>. Due to the yellow coloration of the cells by <i>Cu. longa</i>, much could not be inferred, although it was inferable that it had resulted in little effects. Mixtures of these phytochemicals were used, and it was found that neem: tulsi diluted in 3:1 ratio was highly effective and cell recovery was almost 80%. 68% was recovered by tulsi: green tea in a ratio 1:3 and 42% by turmeric:green tea in a ratio of 1:5. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

INTRODUCTION</div> <p>Nicotine is an alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae) and has been found to be a potent parasympathomimetic and a stimulant drug. It is synthesized in the roots of the tobacco plant and stored in its leaves, and it constitutes around 0.6-3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco.[ <a href="#ref1">1</a>] An average cigarette contains 1 mg of absorbable nicotine,[ <a href="#ref2">2</a>] which acts as a stimulant in mammals. Nicotine has been found to inhibit chromatin-modifying enzymes and class I and II histone deacetylases.[ <a href="#ref3">3</a>] It increases the levels of several neurotransmitters by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with a higher affinity in the brain than in the skeletal muscles.[ <a href="#ref4">4</a>] Tobacco smoke contains nornicotine, anabasine, and anatabine, along with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.[ <a href="#ref5">5</a>] Nicotine has a half-life of 2 h, and is therefore easier to analyze.[ <a href="#ref6">6</a>] When a cigarette is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the lungs to the brain within 7 s and immediately stimulates the release of many chemical messengers such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, histamine, arginine, serotonin, dopamine, autocrine agents, and β-endorphin.[ <a href="#ref7">7</a>] The side effects of nicotine include increased blood clotting tendency, bronchospasm, tremor and pain in muscles, dried mouth, nausea, dyspepsia, headache, light-headedness, dizziness, sleep disturbance, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, coronary artery constriction, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance.[ <a href="#ref8">8</a>] </p> <p>In this study, phytochemicals were extracted from five different plants, <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> (tulsi), <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (neem), <i>Cinnamomum tamala</i> (bay leaf), <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (綠茶 Lǜ Chá; Green Tea), and <i>Curcuma longa</i> (薑黃 Jiāng Huáng; Turmeric). Tulsi is considered to be an adaptogen, balancing different processes in the body, and is helpful for adapting to stress.[ <a href="#ref9">9</a>] It contains oleanic acid which is a naturally occurring triterpenoid acting as a powerful inhibitor of cellular inflammatory processes. Tulsi also has ursolic acid which decreases proliferation of cancer cells and induces apoptosis.[ <a href="#ref10">10</a>] Neem is found to have the same effects as tulsi. Tamala leaves contain caryophyllene oxide which undergoes reduction and produces β-caryophyllene. It is also found to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiulcer, and anticarcinogenic effects. When nicotine (1 mg/ml) extracted from tobacco was added as a stressor, all these compounds showed stress-relieving effect on cells and promoted growth and differentiation of UMNSAH/DF-1 AT cell. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
MATERIALS AND METHODS</div> <p>Nine-day-old fertilized egg was obtained from Midnapore (West Bengal, India). T25 flasks were procured from BioRad (Gurgaon, India). Medium A and Medium B were obtained along with chicken fibroblast isolation kit (Medox, Bangalore, India). CO <sub>2</sub> incubator was from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Mumbai, India). All other equipments including micropipette were obtained from Amity Institute of Biotechnology (Noida, India). </p> <div class="dissectionanddisaggregationof9-day-oldchickenembryo" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Dissection and disaggregation of 9-day-old chicken embryo</div> <p>A mark was made on the pointed side of the egg shell. The handle of a sterilized surgical scissors was used to give short gentle blows and then the egg was cut through the mark. Sterile forceps were used to separate the egg shell. Through the small opening, the embryo was dropped on a sterile Petri plate, followed by separating the embryo from the other yellow mass. The embryo was washed with sterile distilled water twice and kept on a fresh sterile Petri plate for dissection. The head followed by the small tail was cut with a sharp sterile scalpel and then the body was split open as shown in <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>. The tissue was washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer which was diluted from a 10 × stock. The tissue was cut to small pieces, which was followed by its disaggregation using a sterilized mesh. Following the disaggregation of the tissue, the cells were passed through a 5 ml disposable syringe for further disaggregation. This step was repeated five times to yield loosened separate cells. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Stepwise extraction of the 9-day-old chicken embryo from the shell</p>   </div> </div> <div class="isolationofcellsandprimaryculture" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</div> <p>When nicotine was added to the cells, the positive control (A1) showed browning of the cells after 24 h of incubation when observed under 40× resolution of inverted light microscope. Also, the cell membrane started to blacken which could be distinctly seen in <a href="#F3">Figure 3</a>. A few of the cells also died and, therefore, got detached and started to move when a little tap was given to the culture plate. Further, dark black blotches or spots started to appear at various places. Upon further incubation for 24 h, there was complete browning of the cells [ <a href="#F4">Figure 4</a>] with distinct black cell membranes. Also, almost one-third of the plate was completely covered with the black blotches or spots where the effect of nicotine was found to be stronger. Similar was the case in all the wells where nicotine was added. The negative control [ <a href="#F5">Figure 5</a>] was made by culturing the pure cells, which were not subjected to nicotine stress or the addition of any phytochemical extract. No sign of blackening was observed. Also, there was no blackening of the cell membrane or browning of the cells. This gives clear evidence that nicotine deposition had taken place in the cell and the initiation of cell death is also responsible for it. </p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3</span> </a> </div>   <p>Nicotine-stressed cells after 24 h of exposure</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4</span> </a> </div>   <p>Positive control – nicotine-stressed cells after 48 h of exposure</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 5</span> </a> </div>   <p>Negative control – cells without nicotine exposure</p>   </div> <p>Among the cells to which <i>A. indica</i> (neem) extract was added [ <a href="#F6">Figure 6</a>], 70% could be recovered and prevented from the browning coloration.

The attachment of peroxidants to membrane can result in hemolysis of cell.[ <a href="#ref10">10</a>] Cigarette smoke increased 2,2’-azo-bis-(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride–induced membrane hemolysis.[ <a href="#ref11">11</a>] Ursolic acid in <i>A. indica</i> was found to be a weak aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase, also called estrogen synthetase or estrogen synthase, catalyzes many reactions involved in steroidogenesis, due to which it results in a complete reversal of plasma membrane transbilayer sterol distribution. Triterpenoids are terpenoid derivatives of triterpenes such as sterols, cholesterol, etc., found in <i>O. sanctum</i> (tulsi). The addition of neem: tulsi extract in 3:1 ratio suited best for inhibiting the steroidogenesis reaction, hence stopping the attachment of peroxidant molecules to the membrane and minimizing hemolysis. As ursolic acid is a weak inhibitor, it is needed in an appropriate ratio. Therefore, neem is added to tulsi in a ratio of 3:1. Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a type of natural phenol and a weak antiperoxidant present in green tea ( <i>Ca. sinensis</i>). Hence, it is also added in 3:1 ratio with tulsi extract. Turmeric contains curcuminoids (diferuloylmethane), demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin which are antioxidants; but for proper visualization of cells, we added turmeric in a ratio of 1:5 with green tea. The basic idea though was to get the best result for recovery of the nicotine-stressed cells. </p> <p>The remarkable recovery of cells from nicotine stress using the combinations of phytochemicals is the first of its kind and, hence, is significant in the preparation of therapeutic drugs for usage in <i>in vivo</i> systems. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
CONCLUSION</div> <p>When the five extracted phytochemicals were applied to nicotine-stressed cells, it was observed that ursolic acid in neem recovered 70%, followed by 65% recovery by tulsi (having triterpenoid), 50% recovery by catechins in <i>Ca. sinensis</i> (綠茶 Lǜ Chá), and very little recovery by <i>Ci. tamala</i>. Due to the yellow coloration of the cells by <i>Cu. Longa</i>, much could not be inferred, although it was inferable that it had resulted in little effects. Mixtures of these phytochemicals were used and it was found that neem: tulsi diluted in 3:1 ratio was highly effective and cell recovery was almost 80%. This was followed by tulsi: green tea in the ratio of 1:3 and the least effect was shown by turmeric: green tea in a ratio of 1:5. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
