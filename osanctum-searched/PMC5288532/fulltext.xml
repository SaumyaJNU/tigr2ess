Orientin (Ori), a flavonoid component isolated from natural plants, possesses abundant properties. Thus, we aimed to discover the potential therapeutic effects of orientin on lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells and the underlying mechanisms. In our studies, we evaluated the effects of Ori on proinflammatory mediator production stimulated by LPS, including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-18, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, along with prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and NO. Our data indicated that orientin dramatically inhibited the levels of these mediators. Consistent with these results, the expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were also reduced. Further study demonstrated that such inhibitory effects of Ori were due to suppression of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) pathway and nucleotide-binding domain- (NOD-) like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects.

Introduction</title><p>Inflammation, which occurs with various pathological conditions, is well recognized as a complicated innate immune response that protects host organisms from external injuries and pathogens [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, excessive inflammation also contributes to the development of metabolic disorders and cancers [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Sources of inflammation can be diverse, varying from pathogenic infection to tissue damage [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among these causative factors, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the bacterial cell wall and a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), has the ability to activate various inflammation-related cellular responses [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Among downstream events of the TLR4 signaling pathway initiated by LPS, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) is one of the most powerful proinflammatory transcription factors, and it drives a classical signal transduction pathway and gene regulation [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Heterodimers of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B are physiologically linked to a family of inhibitory proteins (I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>Bs) and reside in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. When exposed to stimuli, IKK contributes to the phosphorylation and degradation of I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>Bs, and then, the latter detach from NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequently, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B enters the nucleus and initiates the transcription and expression of proinflammatory genes, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, interleukin- (IL-) 1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, nitric oxide (NO), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These proinflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for numerous immune processes, are majorly regulated by NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B. Among them, IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, a key proinflammatory cytokine, plays a pivotal role in LPS-driven inflammation [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the final mature form of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> requires proteolytic cleavage associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The nucleotide-binding domain- (NOD-) like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) is a multiprotein complex composed of NOD-like receptor (NLR), the adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1 [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once initiated by stimuli, for instance LPS, NLRP3 proteins polymerize and bind to the ASC adaptor, which in turn promotes the recruitment and activation of procaspase-1. Then, the inactive precursors of IL-18 and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> are proteolytically cleaved by the promotion of caspase-1 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These secretions of these proinflammatory cytokines further exacerbate the inflammatory process.</p><p>Considering the detrimental effects of excessive inflammation, the duration and magnitude of inflammation must be exactly controlled, which may be achieved by regulation of the pathways described above. Therefore, the application of anti-inflammatory drugs may have potential therapeutic effects. Orientin (Ori) is a flavonoid component isolated from natural plants, such as<italic> Ocimum sanctum</italic>,<italic> Phyllostachys</italic> species (bamboo leaves) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Over the past decade, it has been suggested to possess abundant properties, such as antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antiglycation, anticancer, and anti-thrombus activities [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite definite anti-inflammatory effects, the underlying mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7 cells has not yet been fully elucidated. Accordingly, in the current study, we sought to evaluate whether the anti-inflammatory activity of Ori is achieved by inhibition of the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Effects of Ori on LPS-Induced Proinflammatory Cytokines</title><p>To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Ori, proinflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. Treatment with LPS alone significantly increased cytokine release in RAW 264.7 cells; however, pretreatment with Ori significantly attenuated release of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicated that Ori inhibited LPS-induced inflammation by reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 in RAW 264.7 cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Effects of Ori on LPS-Induced NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> Production and iNOS and COX-2 Gene Expression</title><p>To further clarify the anti-inflammatory effects of Ori, iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were also measured. LPS exposure induced markedly increased iNOS and COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, and such changes were blocked by Ori treatment in RAW 264.7 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(d)</xref>). Additionally, LPS exposure led to a clear increase in NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> production, which were suppressed by Ori treatment in RAW 264.7 cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>). Such results revealed that reduced NO and PGE<sub>2</sub> production by Ori was due to decreased iNOS and COX-2 expression, which may be important for the inhibition of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Effects of Ori on NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B (p65) Activation</title><p>NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B is an essential transcription factor in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as COX-2 and iNOS.

Effects of Ori on Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome</title><p>To investigate the effects of Ori on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, Western blot analysis of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 was performed. Treatment of the cells with LPS followed by ATP markedly increased the protein levels of all three components of the inflammasome. However, Ori blocked the increase induced by LPS plus ATP. The result also showed that Ori effectively inhibited IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> secretion triggered by LPS plus ATP in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, Ori reduced mature IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> levels via inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is important for inhibiting LPS-induced inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Inflammation is a complex host response triggered by various pathogens and injury. Despite initial protective effects, it is widely accepted that uncontrolled inflammation promotes further tissue damage and serious disorders [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As a major inducer of inflammatory processes, LPS promotes the pathogenesis of inflammation by eliciting vigorous accumulation of neutrophils and the production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 as well as iNOS and COX-2. In previous studies, RAW 264.7 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide were accepted as a canonical model for inflammation research and were applied in our studies [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Orientin (Ori), a flavonoid component that has attracted considerable attention because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, was explored in the present study to unveil molecular mechanisms of its inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine generation and inflammasome activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Our results revealed that Ori significantly decreased LPS-stimulated production of proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-18 as well as iNOS and COX-2. Consistent with this, the levels of iNOS-derived NO and COX-2-derived PGE<sub>2</sub>, which cause inflammation in various diseases, were also remarkably reduced.</p><p>In fact, when LPS is recognized by TLR4 as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), it typically activates macrophages via NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B. As an essential regulatory transcription factor, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B is implicated in pathways that are involved in the excessive generation of inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Aberrant NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activity is known to be involved in many inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, sepsis, gastritis, asthma, COPD, and atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B has been recognized as a pivotal target for the treatment of inflammation. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of Ori, the impact of orientin on NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activation was examined. As shown in the present study, pretreatment with Ori effectively blocked the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and inhibited NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B nuclear transcription in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. These results indicated that the inhibition of inflammation by Ori might be achieved by suppressing NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway activation.</p><p>Although proinflammatory cytokines are essential in inflammatory disease and have been proven to be the most important NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B targets [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the TLR4/NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway is not sufficient to affect some of them, such as IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and IL-18. An increasing number of studies have discovered that NLR is another vital factor during inflammation, except in the TLR-4/NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling pathway [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Inflammasomes containing different NLRP family proteins have already been identified, such as NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been extensively studied in recent years and has been proven to play a pivotal role in the LPS-challenged inflammatory condition. Major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are composed of three sections: NOD-like receptor family, the pyrin domain containing protein (NLRP), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1. In response to different stimuli, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, and ASC then recruits and activates caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 in turn converts pro-IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> to its mature form [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our results revealed increased expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components in RAW 264.7 cells following treatment with LPS. However, such an increase of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> were abolished by Ori pretreatment.</p><p>In conclusion, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Ori treatment effectively prevented inflammatory damage, which may be closely associated with inhibiting activation of the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome.
