    "BACKGROUND:Successful endodontic treatment depends on effective disinfection and complete sealing of root canal. Various medicaments are advised for disinfecting root canal, such as herbal and non-herbal medicaments. This study was done to assess the antimicrobial activity of herbal medicines (neem extract, tulsi extract) and chlorhexidine against Enterococcus faecalis in Endodontics. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Agar diffusion method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial action of different medicines. Sixty samples were segregated into four groups with 15 samples in each: Group I: chlorhexidine 2%, Group II: neem extract, Group III: tulsi extract, and Group IV: distilled water. The inhibition zones against E. faecalis were recorded and statistically assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test (P < 0.05). RESULTS:Significant antibacterial effect against E. faecalis was observed with chlorhexidine followed by neem extract and tulsi extract. CONCLUSION:Herbal medicines seemed to be effective against E. faecalis compared to 2% chlorhexidine gluconate."
