We have earlier isolated and characterized three OS compounds; Ocimarin, Ocimumoside A and Ocimumoside B. However, their role in modulating stress-induced central changes is unexplored.

The monoamine levels and the <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant status in brain regions were evaluated by HPLC-EC and spectrophotometric assays, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>RS significantly increased the dopamine levels in the frontal cortex and decreased in the striatum and hippocampus, and accompanied with selective increase of dopamine metabolites compared to the NS control group. The serotonin and its metabolite levels were significantly increased, while noradrenaline levels were decreased by RS in the three brain regions studied. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the frontal cortex and striatum were significantly increased by RS with decreased glutathione levels and increased lipid peroxidation. Pre-treatment with Ocimumoside A and B (40 mg/kg po) for a period of 3 days prevented the RS-induced changes with an efficacy similar to that of standard anti-stress (<italic>Panax quinquefolium</italic>; 100 mg/kg po) and antioxidant (Melatonin; 20 mg/kg ip) drugs, while, Ocimarin failed to modulate these changes. OS compounds <italic>per se</italic> had no effect on these parameters.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Interpretation &#x00026; conclusions:</title><p>The present findings showed the anti-stress potential of Ocimumoside A and B in relation to their simultaneous modulatory effects on the central monoaminergic and antioxidant systems implicating their therapeutic importance in stress-related disorders.

However, investigating the effect of single stress exposure on central nervous system is also crucial, specifically in terms of initial brain region specific monoaminergic and oxidative responses, and in understanding the mechanism of various anti-stress agents at the early stage of stress exposure.</p><p><italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> Linn (OS), is one of the most widely used medicinal herb in indigenous system of medicine, it belongs to the family <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> and is commonly known as sacred basil or &#x0201c;<italic>Tulsi</italic>&#x0201d;. Stress alleviating and immuno-modulatory potential of OS has already been established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>.

Previously, we have reported the anti-stress activity of ethanol extract of OS leaves and its n-butanol fraction, further Ocimarin, Ocimumoside A and B were isolated and identified for the first time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. However, the underlying anti-stress mechanism of these novel OS compounds, particularly with reference to their modulatory role on the monoaminergic systems and oxidative routes of damage in acute stressful condition remains to be elucidated. Thus, the current study was designed to evaluate the effects of novel Ocimarin, Ocimumoside A and B on acute restraint stress (RS)-induced changes in these central stress systems in rats. The brain regions selected in the study were the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, as these are intricately connected through monoaminergic systems and play an important role in stress responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>. To understand the effect of OS compounds on RS-induced monoaminergic changes, the levels of nor-adrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites were evaluated. We also attempted to explore the RS-induced changes in the <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant status and the modulatory role of OS compounds by measuring the activities of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), selenium dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the extent of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde levels) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the selected brain regions.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p><italic>Animals</italic>: Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethical and Usage Committee of Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow. Adult male <italic>Sprague Dawley</italic> rats, weighing 180-220 g procured from National Laboratory Animal Centre, CDRI, were used in the study. Rats were housed three to four per cage in a room with temperature regulated at 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and a 12h/12h light/dark cycle.

These responses are believed to be developed during the first exposure of stress and/or novel environment. In the present study the initial response of monoaminergic and oxidative systems in important brain regions was evaluated under RS condition. Acute immobilization (restraint) procedure was need to investigate the changes induced by a short acting severe stressor. Among the various stress models, immobilization has been used extensively and accepted widely for studying stress-induced alterations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>.</p><p>RS significantly increased the DA levels in the frontal cortex and decreased in the striatum and hippocampus with selective increase of their metabolites. The variable response of DA in the frontal cortex and striatum by RS can be explained on the basis that the terminals of DA neurons on the frontal cortex may differ from those in the striatum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>. In the striatum, the decreased DA levels were accompanied by subsequent increase in the DOPAC and HVA levels suggesting increased conversion of DA to its metabolite. However, the decreased DA levels in the hippocampus could be due to a possible decrease in the cholinesterase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>. Pre-treatment with Ocimumoside A and B prevented RS-altered DA changes in the frontal cortex and striatum, while Ocimarin failed to prevent any of these changes towards normal values. The NA system is known to be activated by stress; although only for a short duration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, which could explain the decreased levels of NA by RS, as the stressor applied was of relatively longer duration (2.5 h). Administration of Ocimumoside A and B prevented the RS-induced decrease of NA levels. Impaired monoamine function is one of the major contributors to stress-mediated disorders like anxiety and depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>. The exact mode of action of these two compounds cannot be explained, however, a corticosterone like effect can be hypothesized as such effects are inhibited either by alpha-helical CRF, a CRF antagonist or adrenalectomy, suggesting the possible mediation through corticosterone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that RS led to an increase of 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels similar to the reports where physical and psychological stressors increased the serotonergic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>. A report suggested that an acute stress exposure activates tryptophan hydroxylase (TH) in the cortex and midbrain causing an increased level of 5-HT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>. Hence, it can be assumed that the prevention of these serotonergic changes by Ocimumoside A and B may operate by influencing either the activity of TH or the reuptake of 5-HT. However, the differential monoaminergic responses under RS condition suggested regional variations in their levels of distribution, synthesis and degradation. PQ was found to be effective in preventing these RS-induced monoaminergic changes in the three brain regions which could be associated to the presence of its major constituent ginsenosides, known to possess corticosteroid like actions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. The ginsenosides of PQ also modulated the nerve transmissions by altering the availability of neurotransmitters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>.</p><p>It was observed that RS significantly enhanced the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the frontal cortex and striatum, while, CAT activity was increased but did not reach statistical significance. In hippocampus, there was no significant change in the activity of these enzymes. The increased activity of SOD during RS is an indicator of a relative increase in the superoxide radical production, which could stimulate the second line of defence including GSH-Px and CAT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>. However, a lesser change in the CAT activity as compared to GSH-Px indicated that in the brain CAT activity has been found to be low and confined to peroxisomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>. The increased GSH-Px activity may also indicate the increase in cellular peroxide levels, whereas, the decreased GSH concentrations could be due to its increased rate of utilization during oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>. Pre-treatment with Ocimumoside A and B prevented the RS-induced perturbations in the antioxidant enzyme activities, GSH content and the extent of lipid peroxidation. However, Ocimarin failed to alter such oxidative processes. These differential alterations in the antioxidant systems and variable effect of OS compounds in selected brain regions may arise from the differences in antioxidant buffering capacities or differential susceptibilities to oxidative stress. The prevention of altered redox state in RS group by MEL is in agreement with reports demonstrating its potent antioxidant capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this study identified the anti-stress potential of Ocimumoside A and B in relation to their simultaneous modulatory effects on the central monoaminergic and antioxidant systems during acute stressful condition. Further studies need to be done to understand the mechanism of such pharmacological interventions with OS constituents in the prevention of stress-induced neurological and related disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors acknowledge the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India, for providing financial
