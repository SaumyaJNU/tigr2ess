# AMI

## 
[AMI](http://github.com/petermr/normami) is the generic name for a program system for querying and analyzing a small-to-medium (up to 10,000) collection of documents, normally 
on local storage. The primary system includes:

* tools for processing documents into sections and XML
* analyzing components (text, tables, diagrams)
* creating dictionaries
* searching using dictionaries, regexes and other patterns

In TIGRESS we shall use dictionaries in fields such as:

* species (plants). Also possibly microorganisms and animals
* genes
* plant parts
* diseases (plant, humans)
*
