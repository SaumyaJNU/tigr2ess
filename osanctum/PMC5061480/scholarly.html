Aims/Background:</div> <p>This study was to investigated the synergistic effect of polyherbal formulations (PHF) of <i>Allium sativum L</i>., <i>Eugenia jambolana</i> Lam., <i>Momordica charantia</i> L., <i>Ocimum sanctum</i> Linn., and <i>Psidium guajava</i> L. in the inhibition/induction of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and Phase-II conjugated drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). Consumption of these herbal remedy has been extensively documented for diabetes treatment in Ayurveda. </p> </div> <div class="methodology:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methodology:</div> <p>PHF of these five herbs was prepared, and different doses were orally administered to Spragueâ€“Dawley rats of different groups except control group. Expression of mRNA and activity of DMEs were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and high performance liquid chromatography in isolated liver and intestine microsomes in PHF pretreated rats. </p> </div> <div class="results:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results:</div> <p>The activities of hepatic and intestinal Phase-II enzyme levels increased along with mRNA levels except CYP3A mRNA level. PHF administration increases the activity of hepatic and intestinal UDP-glucuronyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase in response to dose and time; however, the activity of hepatic sulfotransferase increased at higher doses. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions:</div> <p>CYPs and Phase-II conjugated enzymes levels can be modulated in dose and time dependent manner. Observations suggest that polyherbal formulation might be a possible cause of herb-drug interaction, due to changes in pharmacokinetic of crucial CYPs and Phase-II substrate drug. </p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

INTRODUCTION</div> <p>Diabetes is a chronic endocrine disorder, characterized by absolute or relative insulin deficiency. The peoples of the world especially in India are facing major health problem such as diabetes. There were 366 million people with diabetes in 2011, a number projected to rise to 552 million by 2030 [ <a href="#ref1">1</a>]. Herbal remedies remain one of the major approaches as complementary alternatives in the management of diabetes mellitus. This is because their benefits are well documented from a historical perspective in diabetic populated areas [ <a href="#ref2">2</a>]. A huge proportion of Indian population relies on the use of traditional medicines for the use of their primary health care [ <a href="#ref3">3</a>]. A major problem resulting from a combination of Ayurvedic medicine in present medical practices is a lack of clinical and scientific data to provide evidence for their efficacy and safety. It is a requirement to carry out research on herbal mixtures, to develop simple bioassays for biological standardization and pharmacological evaluation. </p> <p>However, polyherbal formulations (PHF) are well documented to have the potential of inducing or inhibiting enzyme expression and their activities [ <a href="#ref4">4</a>- <a href="#ref6">6</a>]. Several native products have been studied for the activity on drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) by several researchers [ <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>] and North American botanicals [ <a href="#ref9">9</a>]. Furthermore, most of the studies on herb-drug interactions deal with induction or inhibition of enzymes, and less attention has been paid toward the recovery of these modulated enzymes back to normal levels following the discontinuation of respective herbal drug [ <a href="#ref10">10</a>]. The major DMEs, the cytochrome P450 (CYP), consist of hemeproteins superfamily that catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of exogenous and indigenous chemicals. Several isoforms such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2B1, CYP2C1, CYP2D6, CY2E1, and CYP3A4 appear to be most relevant isozymes participated in the metabolism of clinically significant drugs [ <a href="#ref11">11</a>]. </p> <p>Five plants, all native in India were used in PHF. <i>Eugenia jambolana</i> Lam. is known for its anti-diabetic activity [ <a href="#ref12">12</a>]. Fruit of <i>Momordica</i> <i>charantia</i> L. is a known for anti-diabetic activity [ <a href="#ref13">13</a>]. <i>Psidium</i> <i>guajava</i> L. and <i>Allium sativum</i> L. are known for their anti-diabetic activity [ <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>]. <i>Ocimum</i> sanctum Linn. (Holy basil) has been mentioned in Indian system of traditional medicine to be of value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus [ <a href="#ref16">16</a>]. To achieve the aim, the effect of PHF administration on the transcriptional level as well as the functional activity of Phase-I and II DMEâ€™s in dose and time dependent manner. The effect of PHF treatment discontinuation after multiple weeks on Phase-I and II DMEs was evaluated to assess the time required for the recovery of PHF modulated enzymes back to control levels. With this aim, the present work was designed to study the effect of PHF administration on Phase-I and II DMEs of liver and intestine to assess its drug interaction potential. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The prepared hydroalcohol extracts were concentrated using rotary evaporator at 40Â°C temperature. The concentrated extracts were freeze-dried at âˆ’20Â°C for 12 h then lyophilized using lyophilizer. The lyophilized extracted powders were stored in an airtight glass box and kept in the desiccator until used. PHF was prepared by mixing 200 mg powder of each herb in a single formulation. </p> </div> <div class="animals" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Animals</div> <p>Male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats of weight between 220 Â± 20 g were provided by CSIR-IITR (India). Animals were maintained at 25Â°C temperature in steel cages with alternate 12 h of light and dark cycles and given a pallet diet and water. Before start of experiment, rats were acclimatized for 7 days then divided into two groups, PHF pre-treated ( <i>n</i> = 5) and vehicle treated control ( <i>n</i> = 5). Rats in pretreated group were gavaged (16-gauge gavage needle) with PHF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) for 7 days and multiples of weeks. The PHF suspension was made in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose for oral administration. The control group was administered the same volume of vehicle for 7 days. Animals were allowed free access to food and water but before euthanasia, rats were overnight fasted to decrease the intestinal content. At the end of the experiment, rats were sacrificed by anesthetic ether inhalation. Experiments were carried out in accordance with current legislation on animal experiments as per Institutional Animal Ethical Committee at King Georgeâ€™s Medical University Lucknow (IAEC approval no IAEC/2013/44). </p> </div> <div class="assessmentofphfpretreatmentonhepaticandintestinalphase-idmes" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

DISCUSSION</div> <p>Recent studies have explained the importance and putative effect of anti-diabetic herbs in a single formulation on CYPs and conjugating enzymes. In this study, we used self-prepared polyherbal formulation to evaluate its effect on hepatic and intestinal CYP and conjugation enzymes. This herbal preparation was prepared by five herbs that have been traditionally used as an option for the treatment of diabetes. For effective and safe use of potential herbs, DMEs mediated herb-drug interactions must be studied. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such report available on hepatic and intestinal CYP and Phase-II (conjugation) enzymes for this type of polyherbal formulation. Therefore, the mechanism of herb-drug interactions that might occur with herbal consumption, alterations at transcriptional and/or translational level of DMEs must be studied. The true measure of enzyme response is their catalytic activity instead of total protein. Therefore, in the present study, we directly measured the enzymatic activities of individual CYP enzymes along with individual mRNA level instead of protein level to assess the fundamental mechanism of PHF mediated herb-drug interactions. </p> <p> <i>In vivo</i> modulation of hepatic and intestinal DMEs was studied in a dose response manner using different doses, <i>viz</i>., 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day. Dose response experiment with PHF on CYP suggested that a lower dose (50 mg/kg/day) was adequate to produce effect on hepatic CYP enzymes. PHF pretreatment increased mRNA expression levels of hepatic CYPs to CYP1A1 &amp;gt; CYP2D2 &amp;gt; CYP2D1 &amp;gt; CYP2B2 &amp;gt; CYP1A2 that correspond well with catalytic activities of each CYP (CYP1A1-dependent EROD &amp;gt; CYP2D-dependent bufurolol hydroxylase &amp;gt; CYP1A2-depenedent phenacetin-O-dethylase). However, CYP1A1 is the only intestinal CYP that has been considerably upregulated with PHF treatment. Moreover, PHF pretreatment decreased the mRNA expression of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A1 and CYP3A2 genes and this decrease in mRNA level correspond well with CYP3A-dependent testosterone hydroxylase catalytic activity. Interestingly, no dose dependency was observed at mRNA level as well as the catalytic activity level of any CYPs. Alteration at mRNA level corresponds directly with the activity of respective CYP that may be attributed to alteration at the translational level. However, PHF at dose studied (50-200 mg/kg/day) failed to modulate the expression of hepatic and intestinal CYP2C11 and CYP2E1 activities at transcriptional and activity level. Besides, CYP2C11 and CYP2E1, intestinal CYP2D isoform was also unaffected both at transcriptional and catalytic activity level. Similarly, time response study with PHF (100 mg/kg/day) exhibited that 1 week pretreatment was sufficient to produce the alteration in CYPs at transcriptional and catalytic activity level, and no further modulation was observed with increased treatment duration. In addition, no dose and time dependency was observed (except CYP2E1, upregulated after 3 weeks of treatment) that suggests low dose and 1 week treatment was sufficient for absorption of PHF to concentration level and that too up to saturation level to put forth its effect. However, upregulation of CYP2E1 could be attributed to time taken by responsible PHF components to accumulate up to the level at which they can exert their effect. Even at high concentration pretreatment for 1 week, level that could alter the CYP2E1 was not achieved to exert its effect on CYP2E1. These alterations in the catalytic activity of various CYP enzymes with PHF administration may affect their own metabolism or drugs that are metabolized through these CYPâ€™s [ <a href="#ref28">28</a>]. </p> <p>Similarly, a dose-dependent study with Phase-II conjugation activities revealed that PHF administration increased the hepatic and intestinal UDPGT and GST activity. No alteration was observed in intestinal SULT activity with various PHF doses and time-dependent durations. However, hepatic SULT activities were increased (1.8 fold) at higher doses (200 mg/kg/day). Conjugation enzymes (UDPGT and SULT) play a major role in drug metabolism. Therefore, an increase in activity of these enzymes might result in increased efficacy toward their role such as decreasing the risk of carcinogenicity and toxicity of many drugs, and their metabolites. Nevertheless, increased activity of the Phase-II DMEs (conjugation enzymes) might also affect the efficacy of many substrate drugs, e.g., Acetaminophen (UDPGT) 2-naphthol (SULT) [ <a href="#ref27">27</a>]. </p> <p>We performed a recovery experiment to assess whether the altered level of DMEâ€™s with PHF pretreatment recovered back to normal level or not after the discontinuation of PHF treatment. Although no considerable difference at mRNA and catalytic activity level of all CYP isoforms (hepatic) was observed in between control group and 1 week recovery group, the hepatic CYP1A1-dependent and hepatic CYP2D-dependent enzymatic activities were recovered back to control level after 2 weeks of PHF discontinuation. This late recovery could be attributed to increased amount of CYP1A1 and CYP2D protein that must be degraded to attain normal level. Similarly, to evaluate the effect of discontinuation of PHF after 1 week pre-treatment on Phase-II metabolizing enzymes, we observed a fast recovery of UDPGT, GST and SULT to control level with a recovery period of 7 days. Such fast recovery from induced to control level ruled out the possibilities of Phase-II enzyme mediated herb-drug interaction following the PHF treatment. However, further investigation in human microsomes, human hepatocytes are required to validate their effect to clinical implementation. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
CONCLUSIONS</div> <p>Findings from the present study suggest that the PHF formulation has both inductive and inhibitory effect on DMEs when orally administered. PHF are likely to induce DMEs except CYP3A but less likely to produce significant drug interactions. Certain major factors of metabolism such as competition between co-administered drugs, unspecific interactions with proteins and enzyme induction due to chronic intake are not addressed <i>in vitro</i> assay. However, data presented in this study clearly demonstrate that PHF might have the potential to inhibit or induce the metabolism of certain co-administered antidiabetic drugs which are metabolized by CYPs and Phase-II conjugated enzymes. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
