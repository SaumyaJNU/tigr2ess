    "The aim of this study was to perform green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from the leaf extract of Desmostachya bipinnata (Dharba), a medicinally important herb which is widely used across India. Synthesized AgNPs were analyzed by UV-Visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). The results have confirmed that green synthesis of AgNPs leads to the fabrication of sphere-shaped particles with a diameter of 53 nm. Furthermore, these AgNPs were subjected to antioxidant and antimicrobial studies against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, where AgNPs at a concentration of 20 mg/mL showed highest zone of inhibition. Synthesized AgNPs were evaluated for their antioxidant activity by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH), H2O2, and superoxide inhibiting assays; increasing concentration has showed increase in scavenging ability. Cell toxicity was assessed on HepG2 cell lines, and synthesized nanoparticles at a concentration of 128 μg/mL produced significant reduction in viability of Hep cells (P < .05). The availability of Dharba throughout the year and the eco-friendly approach in the synthesis of AgNPs coupled with bioactivity has demonstrated its potential as a novel biomaterial which can be used for various biomedical applications."
