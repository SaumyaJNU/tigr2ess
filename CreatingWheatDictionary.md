# Wheat Dictionary

compiled by Vinita

## overview
We are creating 3 crop dictionaries for delegates in the workshop. This one is for Wheat (*Triticum spp.*). This is a model for all crop-based dictionaries.

The dictionary is created from the Wikipedia page on Wheat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat and associated links such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_of_wheat. Every entry in the dictionary should have a link to another Wikipedia page (and hence to a Wikidata page).
