The common name of this plant is &#x02018;Tulsi&#x02019; (or &#x02018;Tulasi&#x02019; or &#x02018;Thulasi&#x02019;) and is considered sacred by Hindus. We present the draft genome of <italic>Ocimum tenuiflurum</italic> L (subtype Krishna Tulsi) in this report. The paired-end and mate-pair sequence libraries were generated for the whole genome sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq 1000, resulting in an assembled genome of 374&#x000a0;Mb, with a genome coverage of 61&#x000a0;% (612&#x000a0;Mb estimated genome size). We have also studied transcriptomes (RNA-Seq) of two subtypes of <italic>O. tenuiflorum,</italic> Krishna and Rama Tulsi and report the relative expression of genes in both the varieties.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The pathways leading to the production of medicinally-important specialized metabolites have been studied in detail, in relation to similar pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and other plants. Expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes in leaf samples of Krishna Tulsi were observed to be relatively high, explaining the purple colouration of Krishna Tulsi leaves. The expression of six important genes identified from genome data were validated by performing q-RT-PCR in different tissues of five different species, which shows the high extent of urosolic acid-producing genes in young leaves of the Rama subtype<italic>.</italic> In addition, the presence of eugenol and ursolic acid, implied as potential drugs in the cure of many diseases including cancer was confirmed using mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The availability of the whole genome of <italic>O.tenuiflorum</italic> and our sequence analysis suggests that small amino acid changes at the functional sites of genes involved in metabolite synthesis pathways confer special medicinal properties to this herb.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-015-0562-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic></kwd><kwd>Basil</kwd><kwd>Thulasi</kwd><kwd>Genome</kwd><kwd>Transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Plants of the genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> belong to the family Lamiaceae (Order Lamiales) and are widely distributed in the tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate regions of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These plants are known to produce essential oils comprising of a number of aromatic compounds and Tulsi is rightly known as the &#x0201c;Queen of Herbs&#x0201d; for this reason. In India, these plants are mostly grown at homes for worship and as offerings in temples. Among plants with medicinal value, those belonging to the genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> are very important aromatic herbs or shrubs.</p><p>The genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> is highly variable and possesses wide genetic diversity at intra and inter-species levels. Nine species of <italic>Ocimum</italic> viz., <italic>O. teniuflorum</italic> L., <italic>O. basilicum</italic> L., <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> L., <italic>O. kilimandscharicum, O. micranthum</italic> L.<italic>, O. campechianum</italic> L., <italic>O. americanum</italic> L., <italic>O. minimum</italic> L., and <italic>O. citriodorum</italic> L., are found in India, three of which (<italic>O. americanum</italic> L., <italic>O. minimum</italic> L., and <italic>O. citriodorum</italic> L.) are exotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is difficult to distinguish all these species on the basis of leaf morphology alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The metabolites (essential oils) of genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> have been reported to possess antioxidant and antifungal properties and to cure many diseases including bronchitis in Ayurveda, an Indian system of medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Plants produce specialized metabolites as part of their defense mechanisms and these metabolites have significant medicinal properties that cure several human diseases. They can be isolated from various parts of the plant, including leaves, flowers, roots, bark, seeds and stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pharmacological screening and the systematic study of the chemical constituents of plant metabolites provide a basis for developing new drugs. Some of the important metabolites reported from <italic>Ocimum</italic> species include linalool, linalyl, geraniol, citral, camphor, eugenol, methyleugenol, methyl chavicol, methyl cinnamate, thymol, safrol, taxol, urosolic acid etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These metabolites are of immense value in the pharmaceutical, perfume and cosmetic industries. Metabolites derived from <italic>Ocimum</italic> species have been found to contain many medicinally relevant properties including anti-cancer, antioxidant, antifungal and anti-inflammatory virtues, and are also recommended for the treatment of malaria, bronchitis, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Essential oils produced as specialized metabolites found in leaves, seeds, flowers and roots of <italic>Ocimum</italic> species are used in pharmaceutics and many systems of traditional Indian medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Genome and transcriptome sequencing of medicinal plants serve as a robust tool for gene discovery and downstream biochemical pathway discovery of medicinally important metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently, an abundance of transcripts for biosynthesis of terpenoids in <italic>O. sanctum</italic> and of phenylpropanoids in <italic>O. basilicum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] was reported during an attempt to compare transcriptomes of the two species of <italic>Ocimum</italic>. Despite its important role in traditional Indian medicine and its impressive arsenal of bioactive compounds, our understanding of Krishna Tulsi biology is limited. In this paper, we present the draft genome sequence of the non-model plant <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> (subtype Krishna), along with transcriptomes of two subtypes, Krishna and Rama Tulsi from leaf samples. We have identified a large set of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites of medicinal interest such as apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid pathway, eugenol, and ursolic acid.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Plant and leaf morphology of five <italic>Ocimum</italic> species prevalent in India viz., <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna, <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Rama, <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>, <italic>O. sacharicum</italic>, <italic>O. kilmand.</italic> Leaf morphologies are quite different for the five species</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12870_2015_562_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Genome sequencing and assembly of the non-model plant <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna</title><p>The paired-end (PE; 2x100-bp) and mate-paired (MP; 2x50-bp) DNA libraries were generated for Krishna Tulsi subtype using Illumina protocols. In total we obtained 373 million reads of PE and 166 million reads of MP data for Krishna Tulsi. Low quality (LQ) sequence reads were trimmed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) and reads with quality scores of less than Q30 were removed. The good quality reads were used for de-novo genome assembly. Median insert size of PE data was 335 (with a median absolute deviation of 21), whereas median insert size of MP data was 2473 (with a median absolute deviation of 704). K-mer 43 was opted as the best assembly from the statistical analysis of different k-mers. We obtained a maximum scaffold length of 184.7 Kb (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with an N50 length of 27.1 Kb. This assembly gives rise to a total of 78,224 scaffolds including equal to or more than 100&#x000a0;bp. The current draft assembly of Krishna Tulsi genome is 374.8&#x000a0;Mb in length. The genomic content of Krishna Tulsi is 0.72&#x000a0;pg/2C which is equivalent to 704.6&#x000a0;Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but the estimated genome size by k-mer method is 612&#x000a0;Mb and 61&#x000a0;% of the estimated genome size was assembled. The genome size reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], may be of a different cultivar. This lower genome coverage may be due to limited sequencing data (only two libraries were used in sequencing) or due to a high percentage of repeats (42.9&#x000a0;%). In terms of depth of sequencing, we sequenced 59&#x000d7; of the genome with paired-end (100&#x000a0;bp) and mate-pair (50&#x000a0;bp) libraries (since one lane can produce approximately 30Gb of data, even assuming that reads cover the entire 612&#x000a0;Mb of the estimated genome size). <italic>Ocimum</italic> species are characterized by the different basic chromosome numbers x&#x02009;=&#x02009;8, 10, 12, or 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In case of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> individuals with 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;32, 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;36, and 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;76 have been recorded and the chromosome number of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> is observed to be 2n&#x02009;=&#x02009;36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genome assembly results of Krishna Tulsi</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Assembly</th><th>Status<sup>a</sup>

On an average, 74&#x000a0;% of reads were mapped back to the assembled genome. Almost 83.3&#x000a0;% of the RNA-seq reads were mapped to the assembled genome. The completeness of <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembly and annotations were also checked with two other approaches i.e., by using CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping approach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and DEG (Database of Essential Genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] (please see Methods for details). First, we searched for essential eukaryotic genes in the <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> assembly. This resulted in the mapping of 85.1&#x000a0;% of complete core proteins (CEGMA) and more than 95&#x000a0;% including partial genes against our genome assembly (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S3). Secondly, we searched for the predicted genes from the final assembly of essential genes recorded in the DEG database. We observed that about 89&#x000a0;% of essential genes were included within the assembly. These genes were also validated using Pfam domain annotation and were of comparable domain lengths as the classical members of that family (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4). Phylogenetic trees for highly conserved essential genes like glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S5), cytochrome P450 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S6) and actin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S7) from Krishna Tulsi and their respective homologues were analyzed and compared with other plant species. Krishna Tulsi genes were found to cluster with genes belonging to related species namely, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum, Cucumis sativus</italic> and even with distantly related <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> indicating that highly conserved genes, essential to plant growth and functioning, have been detected in <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> assemblies. These trends further support the quality of the genome assembly.</p><p>Regarding the repeat content of the genome, we identified 78224 repeat regions, with a GC content of 36.1&#x000a0;%, adding to 160889218&#x000a0;bp (160&#x000a0;Mb), which constituted 42.9&#x000a0;% of assembled genome which is 374806882&#x000a0;bp (374&#x000a0;Mb) long (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S5). Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are found in large numbers in plant genomes (Schmidt T<bold>,</bold> 1999) and a similar trend is also found in the type of repeats identified in the Tulsi genome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Genome annotation</title><p>We identified 36768 putative gene models in the initial genome draft (version 1.2) of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> genome.

The synthesis of ursolic acid from squalene is a three-step process starting from squalene (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). &#x003b1;-Amyrin is formed by concerted cyclization of squalene epoxide, while ursolic acid is eventually synthesized by the catalytic activity of multifunctional cytochrome P450. The enzymes involved are, therefore, squalene epoxidase, alpha-amyrin synthase and alpha-amyrin 2, 8 monoxygenase. Sequence search algorithms were employed to search for the three enzymes of this pathway in the Tulsi genome, starting from protein sequences for each of these enzymes from PlantCyc database as queries. The search for squalene epoxidase in Tulsi, using the sequence of this enzyme in <italic>Oryza sativa japonica</italic> (LOC_Os02g04710.2) as a query, gave rise to a hit (C3776143), with 50&#x000a0;% sequence identity covering 80&#x000a0;% of the query length (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>: Figure S13). Using Amyrin synthase LUP2 from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Q8RWT0) and 13 other well-accepted alpha/beta amyrin synthases as a query, four hits were identified in the Tulsi genome (scaffold16333, scaffold20801, scaffold12312 and maker-C3776143). In classical amyrin synthases, a QW structural motif repeats six times in the entire sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while there are two functional motifs, <italic>viz</italic>., a well conserved SDTAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] motif which is believed to form the catalytic pocket and the MWCYCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] motif that is shown to play a crucial role in catalysis. These motifs are observed in the four hits in Tulsi genome (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM24" ref-type="media">24</xref>: Text D). Further, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 16 query sequences and these four hits (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). One of the Tulsi hits, (scaffold 16333_mrnal) clusters with a well-characterized alpha amyrin synthase from <italic>C. roseus</italic> (H2ER439) suggesting that this particular scaffold might indeed retain an alpha amyrin synthase.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>The synthesis of ursolic acid from squalene is a three-step process starting from squalene.

Squalene epoxidase and alpha amyrin synthase, along with alpha amyrin 28 mono-oxygenase, uvol dehydrogenase and ursolic aldehyde 28 mono-oxygenase, play important role in synthesis of ursolic acid.

Similarly, genes involved in the synthesis of 16 other specialized metabolites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM25" ref-type="media">25</xref>: Table S11), are also equally interesting. However, this requires detailed understanding of the mechanism of synthesis and enzymes involved in the pathways. We analysed RNA-Seq data of two leaf samples in order to compare the genes related to important metabolite pathways and the peculiar phenotype of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna with subtype Rama Tulsi. There were 104 transcripts, whose fold change in expression was observed to be eight times more in Krishna Tulsi than in Rama Tulsi. Likewise, there were 229 transcripts whose fold change expression was eight times more in Rama Tulsi as compared to Krishna Tulsi. These are available for download at- (caps.ncbs.res.in/download/tdat_data/Supplementary_tables/Supplementary Table 8.txt).</p><p>In the case of the multifunctional Cytochome P450 (which catalyses the last three steps in the synthesis of urosolic acid, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), a predicted gene from scaffold2032 was obtained as a hit, when a reviewed UniProt entry F1T282 from <italic>V. vinifera</italic> was considered as query and searched in the Tulsi genome assembly using BLAST. This hit retains 61&#x000a0;% sequence identity and the alignment covers 90&#x000a0;% of the length of the query (alignments are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM23" ref-type="media">23</xref>: Figure S13). This scaffold contains a total of three predicted genes viz., Ote100020320011, Ote100020320001 (similar to UHRF1-binding protein) and Ote100020320031 (gene of interest).</p><p>From the available transcriptome assembly, these genes, identified as involved in the synthesis of urosolic acid, were analysed for their levels of expression. The RPKM values were also high for these three genes (please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM21" ref-type="media">21</xref>: Table S9). To further validate the levels of expression of these genes, q-RT-PCR was performed using sequence-specific primers. The presence of these three enzymes is generally high in all the mature leaf samples and highest in Rama subtype (using Krishna subtype as control). Alpha-amyrin synthase is more abundant in mature leaf samples of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>O. sacharicum</italic> species. However, interestingly, the three enzymes are found to be more abundant in the young leaf samples of Rama subtype; in contrast, atleast one of the three genes is less in the Krishna leaf sample and in all root samples. The expression of the three genes implicated in urosolic acid synthesis is uniformly low in samples of <italic>O. kilmund.</italic></p><p>Next, to correlate gene expression and to quantify the presence of ursolic acid and eugenol, chemical profiling was performed using LC-Mass spectrometry from different tissues and samples. Eugenol and ursolic acid were observed in the highest quantities in mature leaf sample of Rama subtype and in relatively low quantities in <italic>O. kilmund</italic>. The amount of eugenol in the leaf sample of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Rama (2235&#x000a0;ng/mg) is considerably high followed by <italic>O. kilmund</italic> (1472&#x000a0;ng/mg), <italic>O. sacharicum</italic> (651&#x000a0;ng/mg) and lowest in <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> (73&#x000a0;ng/mg). In all stem samples, the amount of eugenol is consistently low with the highest in <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Rama (24&#x000a0;ng/mg), <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna (17&#x000a0;ng/mg), <italic>O. kilmund</italic> (15&#x000a0;ng/mg) and below limits of quantification in <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> and <italic>O. sacharicum</italic>. The presence of oleanolic acid is also severely reduced in stem samples of Rama subtype (2869&#x000a0;ng/mg) and in Krishna subtype (1088&#x000a0;ng/mg) in comparison to the mature leaf samples (7556&#x000a0;ng/mg for Rama and 4630&#x000a0;ng/mg for Krishna). The presence of urosolic acid is 50&#x000a0;% less in stem samples of Rama subtype (2883&#x000a0;ng/mg) when compared to the mature leaf samples (4597), whereas it is much lower in the stem samples of other species as compared to the leaf sample. The amount of ursolic acid in the stem samples of Krishna subtype (746&#x000a0;ng/mg) is 4.6 times less than that of the mature leaf samples (3471&#x000a0;ng/mg) (please see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Estimation results of Eugenol and Ursolic acid in different samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>S.

We have performed genome sequencing of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna of the paired-end (PE; 2x100-bp) and mate-paired (MP; 2x50-bp) DNA libraries by Illumina Hiseq 1000. The best <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was obtained at k-mer 43 by SOAPdenovo2, an eukaryotic <italic>de novo</italic> genome assembler. Repeats were identified and masked, and gene prediction and annotation was carried out using the MAKER annotation pipeline by using genomic, transcriptomics and EST data. The nearest species whose genome has been sequenced is the monkey flower (<italic>M. guttatus</italic>), which shares its order Lamiales with <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> (Ote) but falls in a different family (Phrymaceae). Orthology search of Ote Krishna Tulsi genes in four genomes viz. <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Ath), <italic>M. guttatus</italic> (Mgu), <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> (Sly) and <italic>O. sativa</italic> (Osa) also confirmed the close relationship between Krishna Tulsi and <italic>M. guttatus</italic> (Mgu), in terms of the number of common gene families i.e., 578 out of 2488 total genes. When we considered all the 36,768 predicted genes from the Krishna Tulsi genome, we found that 1282 ortholog groups have <italic>Ocimum-</italic>only genes. These 1282 groups contain 13,306 <italic>Ocimum</italic> genes and hence they are referred to as paralogs by OrthoMCL. Of the remaining Ote genes, 17,584 genes were found to be orthologous to any of the other four species studied in this case. We performed an analysis of the genes involved in the metabolite production in <italic>Ote</italic> and the genomes of a few other related plant species. Based on the direct evidence or homology a total of 458 genes were identified in Ote genome, which are involved in coding of enzymes implied in the synthesis of specialized metabolites. Comparative analysis of transciptomes of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna and Rama was performed to detect potential differentially-regulated genes and their involvement in metabolite synthesis. On comparing both the transcriptomes, differentially expressed genes were observed with a substantial number of genes more abundant and others less abundant in either subtypes. Gamma-cadinene synthase is more abundant in Krishna sample (RPKM value 577.047) as compared to Rama sample (RPKM value 31.73). To confirm some of the more abundant genes along with Gamma-cadinene synthase, we performed q-RT-PCR in different tissue samples i.e., stem and leaves and also in five species viz. <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> subtype Krishna and Rama, <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>, <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, and <italic>O. kilmand.</italic> Expression of Gamma-cadinene synthase is found more in Krishna samples as compared to Rama by q-RT-PCR also. Likewise, Chalcone synthase (CHS) is an anthocyanin-producing gene, which is observed to be more abundant in young leaf samples of Krishna and mature leaf samples in transcriptome data. Subsequently, this has been confirmed by q-RT-PCR and from mass spectrometry readings of ursolic acid and eugenol from different tissue samples and from different species.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present a draft genome of <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> Krishna Tulsi subtype Krishna Tulsi.
