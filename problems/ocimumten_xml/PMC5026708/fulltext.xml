Hence, there arise the demands of heavy metal tolerant plant growth promoting bacterial strains for specific metal contaminated agricultural sites restoration. In this study, 36 bacterial isolates were screened out from the rhizospheric soil of <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>. Among these, two bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 were selected based on their higher Cr(VI) tolerance (1200 and 1100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, respectively) and the maximum production of plant growth promoting substances. In the molecular characterization study, both the bacterial strains showed 99% homology with <italic>Cellulosimicrobium funkei</italic> KM032184. In greenhouse experiments, the exposure of Cr(VI) to <italic>P.vulgaris</italic> inhibited the growth and photosynthetic pigments and increased the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant expressions. However, rhizosphere bacterial inoculations alleviated the negative effect of Cr(VI) and enhanced the seed germination rate (89.54%), shoot (74.50%),root length (60%), total biomass (52.53%), chlorophyll a (15.91%), chlorophyll b (17.97%), total chlorophyll (16.58%) and carotenoid content (3.59%). Moreover, bacterial inoculations stabilized and modulated the antioxidant system of <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> by reducing the accumulation of Cr in plant tissues.

Maintenance of soil quality is important for sustainable agriculture. The soil may become contaminated with metals from a variety of industrial and anthropogenic sources. More than 12% of agricultural lands are polluted by heavy metals globally <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Chromium (Cr) is one of the predominant toxic heavy metals discharged by tanneries, textile, metallurgical, paint and other metal processing industries and anthropogenic activities. Approximately 2000&#x02013;32,000&#x000a0;tons/year of elemental Cr are discharged into the environment from the tanning industries of India. Effluent contaminated water irrigation has severely affected crop productivity. About 35,000&#x000a0;ha of agricultural land has become unfit for cultivation due to tanneries in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India, which subsequently decreased the yield of paddy (75%), coconuts (52%) and sugarcane (48%) <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Chromium exists in nine valence states from &#x02212;II to +VI. Among these, trivalent chromium (Cr III) and hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) are the predominant oxidation states of Cr that exist in the environment. Chromium(III) is an essential micronutrient for many organisms and also thousand times less toxic than Cr(VI). Chromium(VI) is the most toxic form due to its high solubility in water and rapid permeability through plasma membranes that can potentially interact with gene transcription, translation and protein expression <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. High concentrations of Cr(VI) cause series of harmful effects to plants. These effects consist of plant growth inhibition, nutrient imbalance, leaf chlorosis with loss of plasma membrane integrity, alteration in bio-membranes permeability, impairment of photosynthesis and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Chromium induced oxidative stress results in the overproduction of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. These free radical species are extremely harmful to plant cell growth and cause senescence <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Plant growth promoting rhizosphere (PGPR) bacteria have the ability to enhance the plant growth and yield through phosphate solubilization, synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA), antimicrobial compounds and siderophores when applied on seeds or to soils <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently, the role of PGPR in metal stress attenuation of plants growing in metal contaminated soils has been recognized <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Improved nutritional status and altered metal uptake are among the most related benefits of PGPR association to host plants under metal stress <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Moreover, these PGPR also affect the availability of heavy metal by various metal tolerance mechanisms, including immobilization, chelation, exclusion, active removal, biosorption and bioaccumulation in external and intracellular spaces <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, these PGPR act as metal sink, reducing local concentrations in soil and creating a more suitable stress free environment to plant in metal contaminated soils <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, such organisms endowed with Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promoting activities are of practically important for both the remediation of metal contaminated environment and plant growth promotion.</p><p>There has been little or no reports on Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promoting ability of <italic>Cellulosimicrobium funkei</italic> strain. However, reports related to the effect of PGPR on plant growth, physiological and biochemical aspects under the Cr(VI) stress are rare. With the impetus given for the year 2016 as the international year of pulses by Global Pulse Confederation (GPC), the study deems scientifically important in managing the agronomic gaps. In the present study, rhizosphere bacterial strains were isolated from <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> rhizosphere and screened for their Cr(VI) tolerance. The most effective strains were identified and investigated for their plant growth promoting traits to understand how they could confer plant growth and alleviation of Cr(VI) toxicity using a native <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> as a model plant. The mechanism for Cr(VI) stress alleviation in the host plant was evaluated by determining non-enzymatic (proline and melonoldehyde content) and enzymatic (catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) antioxidant expression in the rhizosphere bacterial strains inoculated and uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>The analytical chemicals were purchased from HiMedia, Mumbai, India.

In this study, increased accumulation of MDA content (1.74&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/g FW) was observed in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants. This result suggested that the cell membrane was damaged due to Cr(VI) induced oxidative stress in <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> plants. An increased level of lipid peroxidation may be attributed to the enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes to reduce free radical generation levels in Cr(VI) treated plants. Therefore, the cell membrane damage could be minimized <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, higher MDA content was not observed in bacterial inoculated plants, which was decreased significantly. The maximum decrease was observed in AR8 inoculated plant (40.22%) and results are shown in <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. These results represented the amelioration of inoculation to oxidative stress that is related to the reduced Cr contents in root and shoot of these plants. This reduction in Cr content due to inoculation of rhizosphere bacterial strains resulted in reduced oxidative damage and ultimately promotes in growth. The most plausible explanation for such an effect is that the toxicity of the Cr is decreased due to exclusion and immobilization of Cr by inoculated rhizosphere bacterial strains.

Moreover, very few research works have been carried out on <italic>C. funkei</italic> strain. This is the first research report, which elucidates the Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promotion ability of <italic>C. funkei</italic> strain under the Cr(VI) stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0175"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, rhizosphere bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 isolated from rhizosphere of <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, exhibited high tolerance to Cr(VI) and produced plant growth promoting substances under control and Cr(VI) stress, demonstrating their potential to contribute to beneficial plant&#x02013;microbe interactions in the metal contaminated soil. This study provides clear evidence about the response of rhizosphere bacterial strains to Cr(VI) and enhanced <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> growth and antioxidant system under Cr(VI) stress. Therefore, inoculation of these rhizosphere bacterial strains may act as a sustainable factor for Cr phytostabilization and control Cr entry into the food chain.</p></sec><sec
