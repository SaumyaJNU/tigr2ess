Abstract</div> <p>Contamination of agriculture land by heavy metals is a worldwide risk that has sped up noticeably since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Hence, there arise the demands of heavy metal tolerant plant growth promoting bacterial strains for specific metal contaminated agricultural sites restoration. In this study, 36 bacterial isolates were screened out from the rhizospheric soil of <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>. Among these, two bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 were selected based on their higher Cr(VI) tolerance (1200 and 1100 μg/mL, respectively) and the maximum production of plant growth promoting substances. In the molecular characterization study, both the bacterial strains showed 99% homology with <i>Cellulosimicrobium funkei</i> KM032184. In greenhouse experiments, the exposure of Cr(VI) to <i>P.vulgaris</i> inhibited the growth and photosynthetic pigments and increased the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant expressions. However, rhizosphere bacterial inoculations alleviated the negative effect of Cr(VI) and enhanced the seed germination rate (89.54%), shoot (74.50%),root length (60%), total biomass (52.53%), chlorophyll a (15.91%), chlorophyll b (17.97%), total chlorophyll (16.58%) and carotenoid content (3.59%). Moreover, bacterial inoculations stabilized and modulated the antioxidant system of <i>P. vulgaris</i> by reducing the accumulation of Cr in plant tissues. The present finding shows the Cr(VI) tolerance and plant growth promoting properties of the rhizosphere bacterial strains which might make them eligible as biofertilizer of metal-contaminated soils. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Heavy metal contamination is a serious environmental problem, limiting soil fertility and plant productivity and threatening human health. Maintenance of soil quality is important for sustainable agriculture. The soil may become contaminated with metals from a variety of industrial and anthropogenic sources. More than 12% of agricultural lands are polluted by heavy metals globally <a href="#b0005">[1]</a>. Chromium (Cr) is one of the predominant toxic heavy metals discharged by tanneries, textile, metallurgical, paint and other metal processing industries and anthropogenic activities. Approximately 2000–32,000 tons/year of elemental Cr are discharged into the environment from the tanning industries of India. Effluent contaminated water irrigation has severely affected crop productivity. About 35,000 ha of agricultural land has become unfit for cultivation due to tanneries in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India, which subsequently decreased the yield of paddy (75%), coconuts (52%) and sugarcane (48%) <a href="#b0010">[2]</a>. </p> <p>Chromium exists in nine valence states from −II to +VI. Among these, trivalent chromium (Cr III) and hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) are the predominant oxidation states of Cr that exist in the environment. Chromium(III) is an essential micronutrient for many organisms and also thousand times less toxic than Cr(VI). Chromium(VI) is the most toxic form due to its high solubility in water and rapid permeability through plasma membranes that can potentially interact with gene transcription, translation and protein expression <a href="#b0015">[3]</a>. High concentrations of Cr(VI) cause series of harmful effects to plants. These effects consist of plant growth inhibition, nutrient imbalance, leaf chlorosis with loss of plasma membrane integrity, alteration in bio-membranes permeability, impairment of photosynthesis and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Chromium induced oxidative stress results in the overproduction of ROS such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. These free radical species are extremely harmful to plant cell growth and cause senescence <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. </p> <p>Plant growth promoting rhizosphere (PGPR) bacteria have the ability to enhance the plant growth and yield through phosphate solubilization, synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA), antimicrobial compounds and siderophores when applied on seeds or to soils <a href="#b0025">[5]</a>. Recently, the role of PGPR in metal stress attenuation of plants growing in metal contaminated soils has been recognized <a href="#b0030">[6]</a>. Improved nutritional status and altered metal uptake are among the most related benefits of PGPR association to host plants under metal stress <a href="#b0005">[1]</a>. Moreover, these PGPR also affect the availability of heavy metal by various metal tolerance mechanisms, including immobilization, chelation, exclusion, active removal, biosorption and bioaccumulation in external and intracellular spaces <a href="#b0035">[7]</a>. Thus, these PGPR act as metal sink, reducing local concentrations in soil and creating a more suitable stress free environment to plant in metal contaminated soils <a href="#b0030">[6]</a>. Therefore, such organisms endowed with Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promoting activities are of practically important for both the remediation of metal contaminated environment and plant growth promotion. </p> <p>There has been little or no reports on Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promoting ability of <i>Cellulosimicrobium funkei</i> strain. However, reports related to the effect of PGPR on plant growth, physiological and biochemical aspects under the Cr(VI) stress are rare. With the impetus given for the year 2016 as the international year of pulses by Global Pulse Confederation (GPC), the study deems scientifically important in managing the agronomic gaps. In the present study, rhizosphere bacterial strains were isolated from <i>P. vulgaris</i> rhizosphere and screened for their Cr(VI) tolerance. The most effective strains were identified and investigated for their plant growth promoting traits to understand how they could confer plant growth and alleviation of Cr(VI) toxicity using a native <i>P. vulgaris</i> as a model plant. The mechanism for Cr(VI) stress alleviation in the host plant was evaluated by determining non-enzymatic (proline and melonoldehyde content) and enzymatic (catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) antioxidant expression in the rhizosphere bacterial strains inoculated and uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants. </p> </div> <div class="materialandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The surface sterilized seeds were coated with rhizosphere bacterial culture by soaking the sterilized seeds in liquid culture media (10 <sup>8</sup> cells/mL) for 2 h on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. The uninoculated sterilized seeds were soaked in sterile distilled water, which served as control. The inoculated and uninoculated seeds (10 seeds per bags) were sown in polythene bags (25 cm high, 20 cm internal diameter) using different experimental conditions. These were: (1) <i>P. vulgaris</i> (control) (2) <i>P. vulgaris</i> + 50 mg/kg Cr(VI), (3) <i>P. vulgaris</i> + 50 mg/kg Cr(VI) with AR6 inoculum and (4) <i>P. vulgaris</i> + 50 mg/kg Cr(VI) with AR8 inoculum. The concentration of Cr(VI) (50 mg/kg) used in this study was higher than those found in leather industrial effluent contaminated soil, to study efficient plant growth promoting activity of the strains at the higher concentration of Cr(VI) from the lower prevailing concentration. All the treatments were set up in a fully randomized layout of greenhouse polythene bags with three replicates of each experiment. The plants were maintained in greenhouse at 28–36 °C (day time) and 20–28 °C (night time) with 16 h/8 h light/dark (photosynthetically active radiation of 400–700 nm). All the treated plants were watered every two days to maintain the soil moisture level (70–80%). Seed germination percentage was recorded every 24 h for 7 days. Three plants were maintained in each bag 1 week after emergence. To determine the <i>P. vulgaris</i> growth, the length of the longest root and shoot of each plant were recorded after 15 days of treatment. The total biomass of the plants was measured immediately after harvesting by electronic balance. To confirm the viability of the inoculated bacterial strains, rhizospheric soil sample was collected and serially diluted rhizospheric soil suspensions were plated on LB agar plate. </p> </div> <div class="estimationofphotosyntheticpigments" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Physicochemical properties of the contaminated and non-contaminated control soil sample were analyzed and are shown in <a href="#t0005">Table 1</a>. The soil pH, calcium carbonate and electro conductivity nature of the effluent contaminated soil were higher than those of control soil sample. However, parameters such as soil moisture, N, P and K were higher in the control soil than in the contaminated soil. Effluent contaminated soil contained higher concentrations of heavy metals such as Cr (43.04 mg/kg soil), Pb (6.01 mg/kg soil), Cu (0.21 mg/kg soil) and Mn (1.62 mg/kg soil) where metals such as Cr and Pb were observed above the permissible limits of the World Health Organization (WHO) in contaminated soil.

Rhizosphere bacterial isolation and evaluation of Cr(VI) tolerance</div> <p>In the present study, 36 bacterial isolates were screened from rhizosphere of <i>P. vulgaris</i>, grown in leather industrial effluent contaminated soil. Among them, bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 displayed the maximum tolerance (1200 and 1100 μg/mL, respectively) to Cr(VI) and hence were selected for further studies. Such variations in the metal tolerance levels of microbial populations under <i>in vitro</i> conditions are probably due to the differences in genetic makeup and biochemical composition of bacteria and also due to the differences in media and growth conditions employed. Generally, microorganisms protect themselves against metal toxicity by restricting the entry of metal ions into cells or reducing the free ions in the cytosol. However, the reports on the effect of Cr(VI) on PGPR are conflicting. For instance, <i>Pseudomonas</i> strain CRB5, a gram-negative bacterium, tolerated chromium up to a concentration of 550 μg/mL <a href="#b0130">[26]</a>, whereas Cr(VI) reducing strains of <i>Bacillus</i> isolated from rhizospheric soils of mustard and tomato showed tolerance levels of 400–550 μg/mL <a href="#b0135">[27]</a>. </p> </div> <div class="molecularidentificationofrhizospherebacterialstrains" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Furthermore, the effect of Cr(VI) on IAA synthesis was quantitatively assayed and is represented in <a href="#t0010">Table 2</a>. Indole acetic acid producing ability of the bacterial strains under Cr(VI) stress did not differ significantly. Similar production of IAA by Cr(VI) tolerant bacteria has been reported by Wani et al. <a href="#b0135">[27]</a>. The IAA synthesized by bacterial strains can act as a signaling molecule during the plant growth and it enhances the physiological growth of plant such as root initiation, cell division, cell elongation, seed germination and root elongation <a href="#b0140">[28]</a>. In phosphate solubilization study, both the bacterial strains showed positive results in the presence and absence of Cr(VI) and results are represented in <a href="#t0010">Table 2</a>. From these results, it was concluded that the 50 μg/mL of Cr(VI) did not affect the phosphate solubilization ability of the strains.

Exopolysaccharide and ammonia production</div> <p>The influence of Cr(VI) on EPS production of the bacterial strains was investigated and the results are presented in <a href="#t0010">Table 2</a>. In Cr(VI) free control condition, bacterial strains secreted lower amount of EPS, which increased significantly to 14.79 and 5.89% in 50 μg/mL of Cr(VI) treated AR6 and AR8 strains, respectively. Oves et al. <a href="#b0015">[3]</a> reported that the EPS producing ability of the bacterial strains is strongly correlated with Cr(VI) concentrations in the production medium. The excess secretions of EPS produced a protective layer on bacterial cells, which could protect from the toxic heavy metals and pathogenic attack by masking the effects of pollutants and pathogens and hence, the bacteria can survive in the polymeric network of EPS <a href="#b0150">[30]</a>. Interestingly, EPS produced from PGPR could enhance the plant growth by direct and/or indirect mechanisms. For instance, the produced EPS directly stimulated the plant growth by altering the physiological processes of plants such as infection thread formation, bacteroid and nodule development during biological nitrogen fixation and invasion process. While in indirect mechanism, it enhanced the plant growth by increasing microbial activity in the rhizosphere and enhancing the soil organic content and thereby providing stability to soil aggregate with plant roots <a href="#b0155">[31]</a>. </p> <p>When the bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 were inoculated in Cr(VI) unamended medium, a maximum production of ammonia was observed by strain AR6 (60.40 μg/mL) after 48 h incubation and results are summarized in <a href="#t0010">Table 2</a>. In contrast to EPS production, ammonia production was reduced significantly at 50 μg/mL concentration of Cr(VI). Previous reports denoted that, the ammonia produced by bacteria acts as nitrogen source to the host plant and promotes root and shoot elongation, consequently increasing plant biomass <a href="#b0015">[3]</a>. Similar production of ammonia by Cr(VI) tolerant bacterial has also been reported by Wani et al. <a href="#b0005">[1]</a>, <a href="#b0135">[27]</a>. </p> </div> <div class="catalaseandbiosurfactantproduction" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Both the bacterial strains exhibited positive results for catalase production. However, strain AR6 showed negative result for biosurfactant production, both in the presence and absence of Cr(VI). It denoted the potency of the bacterial strain for the survival even in a stressed environment. The catalase production is associated with the resistance ability of the strains against oxidative, environmental, mechanical and chemical stress <a href="#b0160">[32]</a>.

Effect of bacterial inoculation on Plant growth</div> <p>The seed germination rate of <i>P. vulgaris</i> was severely affected in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated seeds with 59.12%. Heavy metals interference changed the permeability of cell membranes, which decreased absorption and transport of metal and water as well as reduced the stress tolerance potential during germination. Additionally, heavy metals inhibited the expression of specific enzymes for germination, which are involved in the seed coat breakdown <a href="#b0170">[34]</a>. Similar to results reported in this study, Gao et al. <a href="#b0175">[35]</a> also reported decrease in seed germination and growth rate in plant grown under heavy metal stress. However, the seed germination rate was increased significantly in bacterial inoculated seeds, as displayed in <a href="#t0015">Table 3</a>. The maximum increase of the seed germination rate was observed in AR6 inoculated seeds (89.54%) followed by AR8 (85.94%). The inoculation of Cr(VI) tolerant rhizosphere bacterial strains increased the seed germination rate by providing a sufficient amount of IAA as phytohormones, which would have stimulated the activity of germination specific hydrolytic enzymes such as α-amylase and protease <a href="#b0140">[28]</a>, <a href="#b0180">[36]</a>. </p> <p>When uninoculated <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants were exposed to Cr(VI), growth parameters such as root and shoot length and biomass were decreased considerably. Chromium(VI) toxicity exerted severe effects on root growth and function, resulting in root damage, reduction in fresh weight, cell division, root elongation and reduced the uptake level of water and nutrients <a href="#b0025">[5]</a>. Moreover, accumulation of heavy metals in plant tissues may trigger water deficit, resulting in reduced growth and development of plants <a href="#b0175">[35]</a>. However, when seeds were inoculated with rhizosphere bacterial strains, the growth parameters of <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants were increased significantly. The maximum increase in shoot length (74.50%), root length (60%) and total biomass (52.53%) was observed in Cr(VI) treated AR6 inoculated plants when compared to uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants, as displayed in <a href="#t0015">Table 3</a>. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria can increase the growth and development of the plants either indirectly by reducing the toxic effects of metals or directly by producing the phytohormones and growth factors <a href="#b0025">[5]</a>. This study showed that rhizosphere bacterial strains possess Cr(VI) tolerant ability, which protected the <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants against the toxic effects of Cr(VI). Another reason for the growth, development and protection of the plants against metals could be the production of phytohormone and uptake of soil minerals by the host plant. Wani et al. <a href="#b0185">[37]</a> also reported similar results in <i>Bacillus</i> sp. PSB10 inoculated chickpea plants. </p> </div> <div class="effectsofbacterialinoculationsonphotosyntheticpigments" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Effects of bacterial inoculations on photosynthetic pigments</div> <p>The chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll contents were noticeably decreased in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants. This may be due to the inhibition of the enzymes responsible for the chlorophyll biosynthesis under the Cr(VI) stress. Heavy metals have a potency to alter the rate of photosynthesis by disturbing the structure of chloroplast leading to the changes in the fatty acid composition, inhibiting photosynthetic pigments and enzymes of the Calvin cycle <a href="#b0190">[38]</a>. Such biochemical alterations in chloroplast due to Cr(VI) stress are expected to prevent light harvesting and cause impairment of photosynthesis. Similar evidence of decreased photosynthetic pigment was reported in Cr(VI) treated <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> plant by Rai et al. <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. Nevertheless, the bacterial inoculations significantly increase in the photosynthetic pigments of <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants and results are depicted in <a href="#t0015">Table 3</a>. The maximum increase of chlorophyll a (15.91%), chlorophyll b (17.97%), total chlorophyll (16.58%) and carotenoids (3.59%) was observed in Cr(VI) treated AR6 inoculated plants when compared with uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants. Different studies have found that plant inoculation with rhizosphere bacterial isolates under metal stress may improve chlorophyll synthesis <a href="#b0005">[1]</a>, <a href="#b0015">[3]</a>. Moreover, the rhizosphere bacterial inoculation under stress might increase the chlorophyll by improving chlorophyll synthesis or slowing the process of chlorophyll degradation. </p> </div> <div class="effectofdifferentbacterialinoculationonstarchaccumulation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The increased level of starch is responsible to maintain the environmental stress, which can function as osmolytes to maintain cell turgor and have the ability to protect membranes and proteins from stress damage <a href="#b0195">[39]</a>. However, rhizosphere bacterial inoculated plants had lower starch accumulation even in the presence of Cr(VI). These results demonstrated that rhizosphere bacterial inoculation decreased the Cr(VI) toxicity and stabilized the plant metabolism under the Cr(VI) stress environment. </p> </div> <div class="effectofbacterialinoculantsonprolineandmdaaccumulation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Effect of bacterial inoculants on proline and MDA accumulation</div> <p>Chromium(VI) toxicity influenced the accumulation of proline in plant tissues. Among the treatments, a maximum proline accumulation was observed in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plant leaves (7.45 mg/g FW). Accumulation of a large quantity of free cellular proline is an adaptive response of plants to various biotic and abiotic stresses <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. Proline seems to have a multifunctional protective role under osmotic stress condition, such as stabilization of protein, membranes and subcellular structures and stabilizing the cellular mechanisms by scavenging ROS <a href="#b0200">[40]</a>. In other studies, Zengin and Munzuroglu <a href="#b0205">[41]</a> also observed a similar result in various heavy metal treated <i>P. vulgaris</i> seedlings. However, <a href="#t0020">Table 4</a> shows the reduced proline accumulation in Cr(VI) treated bacterial inoculated plant. Lower proline accumulated was observed in AR6 inoculated plants (84.56%). These results highlighted that inoculated plants were not affected by Cr(VI) toxicity, when grown in Cr(VI) amended soil. It indicated a positive correlation between proline accumulation and plant adaptation to stress <a href="#b0170">[34]</a>. This could be due to the bioreducing effect of the inoculants on Cr accumulation inside the plant tissues. </p> <p>The plant cell damages occurred due to oxidative stress by ROS generation in the <i>P. vulgaris</i> plant. The ROS generation was measured in terms of increase or decrease in endogenous levels of MDA contents <a href="#b0020">[4]</a>. In this study, increased accumulation of MDA content (1.74 μmol/g FW) was observed in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plants. This result suggested that the cell membrane was damaged due to Cr(VI) induced oxidative stress in <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants. An increased level of lipid peroxidation may be attributed to the enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes to reduce free radical generation levels in Cr(VI) treated plants. Therefore, the cell membrane damage could be minimized <a href="#b0170">[34]</a>. Nevertheless, higher MDA content was not observed in bacterial inoculated plants, which was decreased significantly. The maximum decrease was observed in AR8 inoculated plant (40.22%) and results are shown in <a href="#t0020">Table 4</a>. These results represented the amelioration of inoculation to oxidative stress that is related to the reduced Cr contents in root and shoot of these plants. This reduction in Cr content due to inoculation of rhizosphere bacterial strains resulted in reduced oxidative damage and ultimately promotes in growth. The most plausible explanation for such an effect is that the toxicity of the Cr is decreased due to exclusion and immobilization of Cr by inoculated rhizosphere bacterial strains. It indirectly removed the inhibitory effect of Cr induced oxidative stress on growth and enzymatic activities in <i>P. vulgaris</i>. </p> </div> <div class="effectofbacterialinoculationsonantioxidantenzymesexpression" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Effect of bacterial inoculations on antioxidant enzymes expression</div> <p>The uninoculated Cr(VI) treated plant showed a noticeable increase in CAT (6.94 μmol/min/mg protein), POX (91.51 μmol/min/mg protein) and PPO (9.62 μmol/min/mg protein) expression. Antioxidant enzyme expressions are directly correlated with Cr(VI) stress. Chromium(VI) toxicity leads to trigger some key enzymes of the antioxidant defense system as a result of the overall balance between ROS production and enzyme level in <i>P. vulgaris</i> plant <a href="#b0175">[35]</a>. Similar increases in antioxidant enzyme expression have also been reported by Zhang et al. <a href="#b0170">[34]</a> and Socha et al. <a href="#b0210">[42]</a>, whereas, above mentioned higher antioxidant enzyme activities were not observed in bacterial inoculated plants. <a href="#t0020">Table 4</a> highlights the neutralization effect of rhizosphere bacterial inoculations on enzymatic antioxidant system of <i>P. vulgaris</i>. Lower CAT expression (82.32%) was observed in AR6 inoculated plants. On the other hand, lower POX (30.43%) and PPO (37.14%) expressions were documented in AR8 inoculated plants, when compared with uninoculated Cr(VI) treated <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants. These antioxidant enzyme expressions provided a clear idea about positive interaction between plant and microbes under the Cr(VI) stress. It is interesting to note that though a significant interaction between Cr(VI) stress and antioxidant enzyme activity was found, treatment with rhizosphere bacterial strains tends to reduce the toxic effect of Cr(VI) on expression of antioxidant enzymes. </p> </div> <div class="effectsofrhizospherebacterialinoculationsoncraccumulation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Effects of rhizosphere bacterial inoculations on Cr accumulation</div> <p>The maximum Cr accumulation was observed in uninoculated Cr(VI) treated root (7.92 μg/g) and shoot (4.28 μg/g) of <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants and the results are summarized in <a href="#t0020">Table 4</a>. In contrast, bacterial inoculated plant showed significantly lower Cr accumulation in AR6 inoculated root (71.08%) and shoot (66.12%) tissues when compared with uninoculated Cr(VI) treated <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants. The reduction of Cr accumulation in <i>P. vulgaris</i> tissues, thus exhibited the ability of inoculated rhizosphere bacterial strains to protect <i>P. vulgaris</i> against the inhibitory effect of Cr(VI). The lower accumulation of Cr in plant tissues may be due to the immobilization of Cr by bacterial inoculation. The rhizosphere bacterial strains may immobilize Cr in several ways, including adsorption, accumulation, secretion of cell surface associated polysaccharides and proteins. Similarly, Oves et al. <a href="#b0015">[3]</a> reported a lower accumulation of Cr in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> inoculated chickpea plant. Wani et al. <a href="#b0185">[37]</a> documented similar observable effects in <i>Bacillus</i> sp. inoculated <i>Cicer arietinum</i> plants when grown in chromium-amended soil. Moreover, the root tissues accumulated more Cr than shoots in both inoculated and uninoculated plants. The increased concentrations of Cr in the root could be due to the poor translocation of Cr from the root to upper plant parts. </p> <p>The present findings suggested that rhizosphere bacterial strain AR6 was more effective than AR8 with respect to alleviating the negative effect of Cr(VI) on <i>P. vulgaris</i>. Moreover, very few research works have been carried out on <i>C. funkei</i> strain. This is the first research report, which elucidates the Cr(VI) tolerant and plant growth promotion ability of <i>C. funkei</i> strain under the Cr(VI) stress. </p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>In this study, rhizosphere bacterial strains AR6 and AR8 isolated from rhizosphere of <i>P. vulgaris</i>, exhibited high tolerance to Cr(VI) and produced plant growth promoting substances under control and Cr(VI) stress, demonstrating their potential to contribute to beneficial plant–microbe interactions in the metal contaminated soil. This study provides clear evidence about the response of rhizosphere bacterial strains to Cr(VI) and enhanced <i>P. vulgaris</i> growth and antioxidant system under Cr(VI) stress. Therefore, inoculation of these rhizosphere bacterial strains may act as a sustainable factor for Cr phytostabilization and control Cr entry into the food chain. </p> </div> <div class="conflictofinterest" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
