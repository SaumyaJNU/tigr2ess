Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>] has been widely used for its biological and antimicrobial ability, to dissolve organic tissues, and the capacity to inactivate bacterial endotox-ins. The effectiveness of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>-based pastes depends on diffusion of hydroxyl ions [OH<sup>-</sup>] in concentrations to reach adequate pH levels.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The success of calcium hydroxide paste as a root canal dressing is related to its dissociation into calcium and hydroxyl ions.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Hydroxyl ions [OH<sup>-</sup>] are highly reactive free radicals that show extreme reactivity with several biomolecules. This reactivity is indiscriminate, so this free radical rarely diffuses away from the sites of generation. The lethal effects of hydroxyl ions in bacterial cells are due to the damage of bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, protein denaturation, and damage to the bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> powder for root canal dressing has been used with different vehicles, such as distilled water, camphorated monochlorophenol, normal saline, cresatin, glycerine, and propylene glycol (PG). The dissociation of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> into OH<sup>-</sup> and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ depends on the vehicle used to prepare the paste, and it should allow gradual and efficient dissociation of hydroxyl ions for better action of calcium hydroxide.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Studies have demonstrated that the vehicle can exert a great influence on the release of ions.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Thus, several associations have been investigated to determine the effectiveness of calcium hydroxide pastes. Besides allowing dissociation of the calcium hydroxide, the vehicle also should enhance the antimicrobial capacity of the paste. According to Gomes et al,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> chlorhexidine may be used as a vehicle in an attempt to increase the antimicrobial capacity of calcium hydroxide pastes, as it is effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms, yeasts, and viruses. Based on these aspects, this study evaluated the ability of calcium hydroxide mixed with different vehicles to diffuse through dentin.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Considering the antimicrobial potential of a herbal-calcium hydroxide association, it becomes important to determine how well such pastes can promote the diffusion of ions through dentinal tubules, an attribute essential to the therapeutic effect of any calcium hydroxide paste.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was carried out in the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Hitkarini Dental College and Hospital, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India, and was approved by the institutional ethical committee.</p><p>The study was done on 36 extracted single-rooted premolar teeth with the following criteria:</p><sec><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Single-rooted premolar teeth</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth with no gross caries or fracture</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth having patent canals</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth with full length of root intact.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p> Teeth with gross deviation in their normal anatomy</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth with internal resorption and external resorption</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth having fractured roots</p></list-item><list-item><p> Teeth with obstruction or calcification within the canal system were excluded from this study.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Specimen Preparation<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></title><p>A total of 36 extracted human single-rooted premolar teeth were collected, stored, and disinfected (10% formaldehyde) and handled as per the recommendation and guidelines laid down by the Centers for Disease Control. The crowns were transversely sectioned with a carborundum disk (Ukam, USA), at the cementoenamel junction level. Root canal length was measured by inserting a #15 K-file (Dentsply, Petropolis, Brazil) with a rubber stop. When the file tip reached the apical foramen, the stop was leveled to the cervical edge of the root, and the canal length was recorded. The working length was established by subtracting 1 mm from the total root canal length. Apical preparation was performed up to this limit, up to file #40. The root canals were irrigated with distilled water throughout the instrumentation procedure with a 2-mL disposable syringe. After instrumentation, a #40 file was inserted to the total working length for apical cleaning, and the root canal was filled with an ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid solution (Healix Medico, Mumbai) for 3 minutes. After this period, the root canals were rinsed with saline solution and dried with absorbent paper points (Dentsply, Petropolis, Brazil).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size and Distribution</title><p>The teeth were randomly divided into six groups according to the following calcium hydroxide pastes used as an intracanal medicament:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>

After the complete filling of the root canals, their openings were sealed with temporary cement (Cavit, 3M ESPE&#x02122;). The apical foramen and root canal apex (over the temporary cement) were sealed with epoxy resin (RelyX, 3M ESPE&#x02122;, India).

Twelve measurements were performed for each group/period. For each measurement, the electrode of the pH meter was carefully rinsed with deionized water and dried with absorbent paper to eliminate any residues that could interfere with the measurements.

The success of calcium hydroxide as a root canal dressing lies in its dissociation into ionic forms, i.e., calcium and hydroxyl ions. These hydroxyl ions alkalinize the environment and thus help in activating the alkaline phosphatase enzyme, which induces mineralized tissue formation and thus is helpful in the repair process.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>To be effective, the hydroxyl ions should be able to diffuse in dentin and remain in pulp tissues at a sufficient concentration to produce the pH level required to destruct bacteria inside the root canal and dentinal tubules. The action of these ions on tissues and bacteria explains the biological and antimicrobial properties of calcium hydroxide.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Calcium hydroxide is used as paste, and the vehicle required to make the paste of calcium hydroxide may well increase the suitability of calcium hydroxide as a filling.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The studies have proved that aqueous and viscous vehicles have more effectiveness as compared with the oily vehicles.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Similarly, it has been shown that nonalcoholic preparations of PG and bee propolis as vehicles showed good diffusion through dentin.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The present study was aimed to identify some more preparations to be used as a vehicle for calcium hydroxide paste to improve the diffusion capabilities of calcium hydroxide. Aqueous vehicles were used in the present study, which was in accordance with the studies conducted previously.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Herbal preparations are always welcome in present-day science due to the multitude of benefits due to the phytochemicals present in herbs. Withaferin A and 3-b-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-withanolide F isolated from Ashwagandha <italic>(Withania somnifera)</italic> show promising antibacterial, antitumor, immunomodulating, and anti-inflammatory properties.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Such herbal preparations, if used smartly, can provide additional benefits. In the present study, Ashwagandha and the papaya latex showed the diffusion of ions through the dentinal tubules in a sustained manner (up to 168 hours) in comparison with normal saline. All the herbal pastes in the present study, which diffused through the dentinal tubules, presented a better ability to alkalize external root surface after 72 hours when compared with saline.</p><p>Coconut water has a much better composition of minerals like calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium, and zinc compared with other fruits.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The better diffusion ability and marked antimicrobial activity make them the best materials, which can be used as vehicles. The use of papaya latex extract and Ashwagandha with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal medicament may thus be suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ashwagandha and papaya latex extracts as vehicles for calcium hydroxide are suggested as an intracanal medicament. Further studies are required to confirm the present data.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Source of support</bold>: Nil</p><p><bold>Conflict of
