Current study aims at identifying anti-diabetic candidate compounds from <italic>Ocimum</italic> species. Major metabolites in <italic>O</italic>. <italic>kilimandscharicum</italic>, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tenuiflorum</italic>, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>gratissimum</italic> were purified, characterized and evaluated for anti-glycation activity. <italic>In vitro</italic> inhibition of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by eugenol was found to be highest. Preliminary biophysical analysis and blind docking studies to understand eugenol-albumin interaction indicated eugenol to possess strong binding affinity for surface exposed lysines. However, binding of eugenol to bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not result in significant change in secondary structure of protein. <italic>In vivo</italic> diabetic mice model studies with eugenol showed reduction in blood glucose levels by 38% likely due to inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase while insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels remain unchanged. Western blotting using anti-AGE antibody and mass spectrometry detected notably fewer AGE modified peptides upon eugenol treatment both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Histopathological examination revealed comparatively lesser lesions in eugenol-treated mice. Thus, we propose eugenol has dual mode of action in combating diabetes; it lowers blood glucose by inhibiting &#x003b1;-glucosidase and prevents AGE formation by binding to &#x003b5;-amine group on lysine, protecting it from glycation, offering potential use in diabetic management.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder of multiple etiologies characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. Pharmacological treatment of diabetes includes the use of oral anti-diabetic agents that aid in controlling hyperglycemia. These drugs either promote insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity; decrease the hepatic glucose output or aid in absorption of glucose. An important class of drug molecules, effective in management of diabetes is &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors. These regulate blood glucose level by inhibiting digestion of oligosaccharides/carbohydrates like maltose, maltotriose, dextrins, sucrose etc. into glucose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Examples of &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors includes acarbose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, miglitol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, voglibose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> etc.</p><p>Apart from these drugs, inhibition of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is considered as a useful therapeutic strategy in management of diabetes. AGEs are formed by a series of non-enzymatic reactions between reducing sugars and amine group of proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Upon glycation, proteins tend to lose their structure and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. AGEs bind to receptor for AGEs (RAGE), spawn reactive oxygen species, and downstream signaling contributes basically in elicitation of pro-inflammatory response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>AGEs and AGE-RAGE axis has been implicated in various disease pathophysiologies including vascular and diabetic complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.Growing evidences on involvement of AGEs in disease has made them attractive therapeutic targets. Thus molecule(s) that inhibit the formation of AGEs are effective in management of diabetes. Consequently extensive research effort has been devoted to develop anti-AGE therapeutics. These includes (i) preventing the formation of AGEs, example, ascorbic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, aspirin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, metformin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, etc. (ii) de-glycation of Schiff bases/Amadori products involving transglycation approach using drugs like hydralazine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, (iii) reversal of AGE induced modifications like cross links, example, phenacylthiazolium bromide (PTB)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and (iv) preventing the body from ill effects of AGE formation, example, resveratrol and curcumin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Combination of oral drugs, and oral drugs with insulin has been used for better control of diabetes and diabetic vascular complications. For example, combination therapy with repaglinide and rosiglitazone has been verified to be safe and effective in diabetes treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Similarly, combination of voglibiose with glibenclamide or gliclazide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; or miglitol with metformin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> offer better glycemic control.</p><p>Therapeutically important genus <italic>Ocimum</italic>, comprising herbaceous members belonging to family Lamiaceae, is considered a boon for medicinal chemists<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Leaf extracts of several species have a long and successful history of being used in ancient folk medicine; having antioxidant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, antistress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, anticancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, radiation protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, antifungal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, insecticidal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and several other bioactivities. The key to this medicinal potential of genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> might lie in the vast array of secondary metabolites and phytochemicals including terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds etc. present in various plant parts. <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> (former <italic>O. sanctum</italic>) leaf extracts have been shown to have hypoglycemic effects by induction of insulin secretion from perfused pancreas, isolated islets and clonal pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>; however, the principle compound and its mechanism of action are poorly understood. In view of this, we demonstrate the anti-diabetic activity of eugenol from <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches. Here we have shown, eugenol isolated from <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> to have a potential dual effector role in diabetes control; it acts as an effective &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor as well as a glycation inhibitor, mimicking the effect of combination therapy. Although both synthetic and natural anti-diabetic therapeutics are available, latter seems to be the obvious choice owing to its low toxicity and lesser side effects. Thus, identifying anti-AGE lead molecules of natural origin would provide a significant thrust to diabetes research in future.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chemical profiling unravels terpene and phenylpropanoid abundance in <italic>Ocimum</italic> species</title><p>GC-MS based chemical profiling of leaf tissue of three <italic>Ocimum spp.</italic> revealed that each species was rich in a specific set of compounds representing a distinct metabolic fingerprint. Results indicated predominance of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and phenylpropanoids. Hydrocarbons including dodecane, dodecene, heptene, octane derivatives etc. were detected in minor quantities. The entire list of compounds identified is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> online. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> provides a selected subset of major metabolites screened for antiglycation activity using BSA-AGE assay.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> inhibition of AGEs by metabolites from <italic>Ocimum</italic> species</title><p>Leaf and inflorescence extracts from three <italic>Ocimum</italic> species and major metabolites therein including camphor, eucalyptol, eugenol, eugenol methyl ether (EME), ocimene, &#x003b1;-pinene, terpinolene, &#x003b2;-caryophyllene and farnesene were evaluated for their <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-glycation activity using BSA-AGE fluorescence assay. Maximum inhibition of glycation was observed with <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> extract, which is rich in eugenol. Inflorescence and leaf extracts of <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> inhibited the formation of AGEs by 74% and 72%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>O. tenuiflorum</italic> leaf extracts rich in EME showed least (10%) inhibition of glycation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>O. kilimandscharicum</italic> leaf and inflorescence extracts, rich in camphor and eucalyptol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) displayed significant inhibition of AGE formation, 46% and 42%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Of all the metabolites assessed, eugenol displayed highest, 58% inhibition of glycation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Other metabolites did not inhibit AGE formation significantly. Based on these studies, eugenol, the major metabolite present in <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> was considered for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 50% AGE formation (IC<sub>50</sub>) for eugenol was 10&#x02009;mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) while for aminoguanidine hydrochloride was 1&#x02009;mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p>Since anti-glycation activity of extracts was significantly higher than that of individual metabolites, it was hypothesized that either of the following possibilities might exist: (i) anti-glycation activity of tissue extracts maybe due to synergistic action of a group of metabolites rather than a single metabolite or (ii) the metabolites present <italic>in planta</italic> are structurally modified, imparting them enhanced anti-glycation potential. To test this hypothesis, major metabolites (eugenol, EME and camphor) were purified and characterized by NMR analysis. Results indicated that there were no structural difference between metabolites present <italic>in planta</italic>, in comparison with standard compounds procured from Sigma-Aldrich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Since these metabolites present <italic>in planta</italic> were not structurally modified, it can be suggested that the increased antiglycation activity of <italic>Ocimum</italic> tissue extracts is probably due to synergistic effect of a group of metabolites. However, further investigation is required to acertain the hypothesis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Eugenol shows increased binding affinity for surface lysine residues on mouse serum albumin but does not alter the protein secondary structure</title><p>Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> BSA-AGE assay, eugenol was observed to be a potent inhibitor of AGEs compared to EME. Structurally, the difference between eugenol and EME is that, in eugenol a hydroxyl group is present at the para position (4&#x02032;-OH); however, in EME this group is masked by the presence of a methyl group. We speculate the anti-glycation activity of eugenol might be due to the presence of free 4&#x02032;-OH group. Previous studies support the fact that, presence and position of hydroxyl group determines the activity of flavonoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We imply that masking of active hydroxyl group in EME is responsible for decline in antiglycation activity of the compound. To gain more insight into eugenol-protein interaction, blind docking study of eugenol with mouse serum albumin (MSA) was performed. Out of many surface-exposed lysine, blind docking results indicate that eugenol preferentially binds to Lys-236 and Lys-375. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, surface exposed lysine residues have been marked in red, and binding of multiple eugenol molecules to single MSA molecule is depicted. Eugenol shows stronger binding (average binding energy, 6&#x02009;Kcal/mol) with surface exposed lysines as compared to aminoguanidine hydrochloride (average binding energy, 4.3&#x02009;Kcal/mol). EME also showed strong binding affinity for MSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), however, it did not display good inhibition of glycation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, preliminary evidence suggests that the 4&#x02032; -OH group of eugenol is potentially capable of binding to the amine group of lysine residues on protein molecule and competitively inhibiting the binding of sugar.</p><p>Intrinsic fluorescence assay and circular dichorism (CD) were performed to understand the nature of interaction between eugenol and BSA. In the intrinsic fluorescence assay, it was evident that eugenol binds to BSA in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). As the concentration of eugenol was increased, a consistent decrease in intrinsic fluorescence intensity was documented. CD of BSA incubated with eugenol was performed to understand the effect of binding of eugenol on the secondary structure of BSA. However, the secondary structure of BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) remained unchanged (84.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9%, &#x003b1;-helix; 4.85&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2%, &#x003b2;-sheet; 4.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9%, &#x003b2;-turn; 7.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2% unordered). The interaction did not induce any transition from &#x003b1;-helix to &#x003b2;-sheet or <italic>vice versa</italic>. in the structure of protein. Hence we conclude that eugenol binds to BSA but the binding does not cause any significant change in the secondary structure of BSA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Eugenol administration affects blood biochemical parameters</title><p>The effect of administration of eugenol on blood glucose, HbA1c and insulin was investigated. Since hyperglycemia is known to be the foremost cause of diabetic complications, molecule(s) that lower blood glucose are frontrunners for management of diabetes. Mice belonging to Group I (STZ control) and group II (vehicle control) did not show any significant decrease in blood glucose (396&#x02009;mg/dL and 353&#x02009;mg/dL, respectively). Mice belonging to Group III (eugenol- treated mice) exhibited a 38% decrease in blood glucose, with levels dropping from 420&#x02009;mg/dL to 262&#x02009;mg/dL, on an average (two-tailed <italic>p-value</italic>, 0.0042). Lowering blood glucose level helps subsequently in lowering formation of AGEs. Administration of eugenol showed significant decrease in blood glucose level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Although the blood glucose levels decreased, it did not lead to a severe hypoglycemic condition. Decrease in blood glucose may be attributed to the inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), as discussed in subsequent section. Furthermore, the blood glucose levels increased when the treatment was withdrawn.</p><p>HbA1c essentially serves as a marker for monitoring glycemic status over a period of three months. We did not notice any significant change in HbA1c levels between different groups of mice: Group I (9.9), Group II (10.7), Group III (8.9), values in the parenthesis represent average for each group of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The possible reason behind no significant change in HbA1c level may be due to the short duration of study (45 days). HbA1c levels are known to changes over a period of 3 to 4 months. Since our study was restricted to a short period of 45 days, no drastic changes in HbA1c levels were observed. No significant change in the insulin level was evident between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>) suggesting that eugenol lowers the blood glucose by inhibiting glucosidase activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mixed inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase by eugenol might lead to decrease in blood glucose</title><p>We speculate that, the decrease in blood glucose may be due to inhibition of intestinal &#x003b1;-glucosidase. &#x003b1;-Glucosidase is localized in brush border epithelium of small intestine and catalyzes the conversion of oligosaccharides/carbohydrates like maltose, maltotriose, dextrins, sucrose etc. into glucose. &#x003b1;-Glucosidase inhibitors are known to lower blood glucose level by slowing carbohydrate metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Eugenol inhibited yeast &#x003b1;-glucosidase in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) with IC<sub>50</sub> value around 5&#x02009;mM. Lineweaver-Burke plot analysis revealed mixed type of inhibition; thus, eugenol can bind to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows a schematic representation of inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase by eugenol. Therefore, eugenol as an &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor can be a potential candidate in the treatment and management of diabetes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Eugenol treated mice display significantly less histopathological lesions</title><p>Histopathology was performed to understand the gross and microscopic effect of eugenol on different tissues (spleen, liver, heart, lungs, kidney, pancreas and brain). Spleen, heart and lung tissues of mice belonging to all three groups did not show significant abnormal lesions. However, brain, pancreas, kidney and liver tissue displayed moderate to severe histopathological lesions depending upon the treatment administered. Mice belonging to Group I revealed most severe lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>) followed by those belonging to Group II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). In both these groups, brain tissue revealed mononuclear cell proliferation and focal hemorrhages. Pancreas exhibited focal destruction of acinar cells, hemorrhages and mononuclear cell infiltration. Kidney sectioning exposed necrosis of tubular epithelial cells, focal hemorrhages and mononuclear cell infiltration. Liver reflected severe hemorrhages and focal necrosis of hepatic cells. Occurrence of these severe lesions may be due to oxidative stress related cell injury caused by hyperglycemia in these groups. Occurrence of aforementioned lesions was significantly less in mice belonging to Group III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>), however, mild degeneration was observed in hepatocytes. The results indicate that eugenol treated mice displayed healthier histopathology than diabetic mice emphasizing therapeutic effect of eugenol against hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Western blot analysis shows <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of AGEs by eugenol</title><p>Western blot analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> BSA-AGE assay samples and <italic>in vivo</italic> plasma samples showed significant differences in eugenol-treated and un-treated glycated BSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a,c</xref>) as well as eugenol-treated and un-treated STZ mice plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b,d</xref>) following statistical analysis of blot density data.

Further, eugenol can also inhibit the formation of AGEs by competitively inhibiting the binding of sugar to proteins both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro,</italic> as discussed previously. Thus, both these factors result in overall lesser accumulation of AGEs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>LC-MS analysis reveals lesser extent of AGE modification on peptides upon eugenol treatment</title><p>LC-MS analysis was performed to understand the sites of AGE modification for both <italic>in vitro</italic> BSA-AGE assay and <italic>in vivo</italic> plasma protein especially mouse serum albumin (MSA). Heatmap analysis showing extent of AGE modification on glycated peptides, including glycation sensitive amino acid residues (GSAR) containing peptides of MSA is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9f</xref>. It was noticed that AGE modified peptides were found to decrease in response to eugenol treatment and were found to be highest in plasma of STZ treated diabetic mice. The MS/MS spectra of AGE modified peptides are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemetary Fig. S2</xref>.

The fact that extent of AGE-modification is less on peptides containing GSAR residues, makes eugenol a convincing candidate for early inhibition of glycation. Similarly, eugenol showed significantly lesser AGE modification in <italic>in vitro</italic> glycated BSA sites K36, K88, K160, K184, K263, K438 and K548 in comparison with glycated BSA and positive control AMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>).

It might inhibit intestinal &#x003b1;-glucosidase and block the conversion of complex carbohydrates to glucose, resulting in lower blood glucose level and subsequent reduction in AGE formation.
