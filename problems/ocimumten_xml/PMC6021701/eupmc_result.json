    "Internet search engines and online recipe repositories have become increasingly popular resources among households for recipes and meal planning. Meanwhile, fish sauce's distinct flavor makes it a popular condiment in Southeast Asian countries. Although fish sauce is used as a condiment for traditional cuisine in Japan, it is not popular for general household use. To understand the consumption behavior regarding fish sauce in Japanese households, we analyzed search trends for the words nampla (Thai fish sauce), nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce), and shottsuru (Japanese fish sauce) using Google's search engine and the Japanese online recipe site Cookpad. The results clearly indicate nampla's rising popularity due to the rapid spread of Thai cuisine and an annually increasing traditional consumption of Japanese fish sauce. These results provide insights into the household demand for fish sauce."
