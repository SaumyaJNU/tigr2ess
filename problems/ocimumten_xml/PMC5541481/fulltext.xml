For the CE, the analytical response was also intensified with the increase of the aliquot, being chosen 1 mL of HCl. Low acid concentrations may result in incomplete hydrolysis. At this stage, sugars should be released for identification and quantification of aglycones. Therefore, the amount of HCl must provide complete breakage of the glycosidic bonds and at the same time must avoid the degradation of the aglycones.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Wavelength selection</title><p>The wavelengths for the quantitative analyses were determinate from the maximums absorptions observed in the UV-spectrums. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the UV-spectrums for the samples after complexation with AlCl<sub>3</sub> (5.0%).
