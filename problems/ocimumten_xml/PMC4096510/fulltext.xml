However, little was known about CADs in melon. Five CAD-like genes were identified in the genome of melons, namely <italic>CmCAD1</italic> to <italic>CmCAD5</italic>. The signal peptides analysis and CAD proteins prediction showed no typical signal peptides were found in all <italic>CmCADs</italic> and <italic>CmCAD</italic> proteins may locate in the cytoplasm. Multiple alignments implied that some motifs may be responsible for the high specificity of these CAD proteins, and may be one of the key residues in the catalytic mechanism. The phylogenetic tree revealed seven groups of CAD and melon CAD genes fell into four main groups. <italic>CmCAD1</italic> and <italic>CmCAD2</italic> belonged to <italic>the bona fide</italic> CAD group, in which these CAD genes, as representative from angiosperms, were involved in lignin synthesis. Other <italic>CmCADs</italic> were distributed in group II, V and VII, respectively. Semi-quantitative PCR and real time qPCR revealed differential expression of <italic>CmCADs</italic>, and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> was expressed in different vegetative tissues except mature leaves, with the highest expression in flower, while <italic>CmCAD2</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> were strongly expressed in flesh during development. Promoter analysis revealed several motifs of CAD genes involved in the gene expression modulated by various hormones. Treatment of abscisic acid (ABA) elevated the expression of <italic>CmCADs</italic> in flesh, whereas the transcript levels of <italic>CmCAD1</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> were induced by auxin (IAA); Ethylene induced the expression of <italic>CmCADs</italic>, while 1-MCP repressed the effect, apart from <italic>CmCAD4</italic>. Taken together, these data suggested that <italic>CmCAD4</italic> may be a pseudogene and that all other <italic>CmCADs</italic> may be involved in the lignin biosynthesis induced by both abiotic and biotic stresses and in tissue-specific developmental lignification through a CAD genes family network, and <italic>CmCAD2</italic> may be the main CAD enzymes for lignification of melon flesh and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> may also function in flower development.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31272154).

Lignification is a complex process, which involves many intermediates and enzymes <xref rid="pone.0101730-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyses the final step of the lignin biosynthesis, the conversion of cinnamyl aldehydes to alcohols, using NADPH as a cofactor <xref rid="pone.0101730-Sattler1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Recent phylogenetic analysis suggested that the emergence of real lignin in the vascular plant lineage was associated with the origin of <italic>the bona fide</italic> CAD genes <xref rid="pone.0101730-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The primary genes involved in lignin biosynthesis,such as <italic>AtCAD4</italic> and <italic>AtCAD5</italic>(<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0101730-Tronchet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <italic>EgCAD2</italic> (eucalyptus) <xref rid="pone.0101730-Goffner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and <italic>OsCAD2</italic> (rice) <xref rid="pone.0101730-Hirano1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> have been characterized, which have a dominant role in normal tissue lignification. Furthermore, Other CADs could serve in other functions in different plant tissues. These function could range from a role in redundant (non-xylem) tissue lignification (example as a response to stress) <xref rid="pone.0101730-Saidi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Barakat2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101730-Saathoff1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Bhuiyan1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Latreche1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and in biochemical processes unrelated to lignification <xref rid="pone.0101730-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Interestingly, there are differences in function between members of CAD genes family in angiosperm species; However, comprehensive analyses of lignified tissues of various <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> knockout mutants (for <italic>AtCAD5, 6</italic>, and <italic>9</italic>) at different stages of growth/development indicated the presence of functionally redundant CAD metabolic networks <xref rid="pone.0101730-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Hirano1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Tronchet1" ref-type="bibr">[29,]</xref>. The biochemical roles of CAD genes still need to be elucidated, particularly being differences in the lignin composition of tissues/plant species result from the different activities of several CAD isoenzymes, each with a different specificity. However, even though CADs have been investigated from a number of plant species, there are currently no reports on CAD in melons.</p><p>In this study we identified five CAD-like genes from the melons genome, and compared CAD sequences from a wide variety of plants, making full use of the available plant genome sequences (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Oryza, Sorghum, Wheat, Populus, Medicago, et al.) as well as expressed sequence databases for species of basal angiosperms and gymnosperms. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the CAD gene family with related CAD proteins from other species indicated that five <italic>CmCADs</italic> were classified into four groups separately. We analyzed the structure and the promoter of melon CAD genes, and also investigated this CAD genes transcript in response to various fruit development stages and monitored tissue-specific expression. The effect of various plant hormones on <italic>CmCADs</italic> was also examined. We reported here the results of these analyses, suggesting that the <italic>CmCADs</italic> may be involved in melon fruit lignification induced by various hormones and during development and ripening and in tissue-specific developmental lignification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials and treatments</title><p>All the experiments were carried out with &#x02018;CaiHong7&#x02019;, oriental sweet melons (<italic>Cucumis melo</italic> var. <italic>makuwa</italic> Makino).

Freshly opened female flowers were sprayed with growth regulator &#x02018;Fengchanji 2&#x02019; (a hormone complex, which mainly contains 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid to increase the rate of fruit set; Shenyang Agricultural University) and tagged on the day of bloom to identify fruit of known age. Plants were trained as single stem, and two or three fruits per vine. Physiological maturity of this sweet melon is about thirty-six days after anthesis. Melons were harvested after 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45 and 48 days after anthesis. Mature leaf, developing leaf, pistillate flower, staminate flower, young stems and root tissues were collected from plants grown in a greenhouse for expression analysis.</p><p>Mature unripe oriental sweet melons were harvested at 30 days after anthesis (pre-climacteric stage) with the same node of the plant at a mature green stage, before the onset of ripening, and ripening was initiated by exposing the fruits to exogenous ethylene (100 &#x000b5;L/L) for 24 h in a closed 33 L chamber and then allowed to ripen for 12 days at 23&#x000b0;C in air only. Fruits that were allowed to undergo post-harvest ripening in air for 12 days without any exogenous ethylene treatment were treated as control.

Three replicates were prepared for each treatment, and each replicate consisted of 15 fruit unless indicated otherwise. Fresh tissue was sampled every 48 h, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further use. For abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin (IAA) treatment, the fruit discs were dipped in a solution containing 100 &#x000b5;M ABA or IAA in 0.2% teepol (detergent) and vacuum infiltrated for 2 h. Infiltrated with 0.2% teepol were used as control fruits. All plant materials were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

These findings suggested that there seems to be the question of their functional redundancy in the CADs genes network. Therefore, we speculated that <italic>CmCADs</italic> might be involved in both lignin synthesis and pathogen defense. These results also suggested that plant CAD genes might also participate in other unknown functions or have evolved individual functions <xref rid="pone.0101730-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. There is much to learn about CADs in dicotyledon.</p><p>Apart from lignin biosynthesis, biotic and abiotic stresses, plant CAD genes were also implicated in fruit tissue development and were closely related to tissue ageing. For example, loquat flesh tissue undergone lignification during ripening, which resulted to the increase in firmness, and CAD transcripts particularly accumulated during storage, modified by ethylene <xref rid="pone.0101730-Shan1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

Hence, we speculated that both <italic>CmCAD2</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> could be involved in fruit development. While <italic>CmCAD2</italic> only belonged to group I as <italic>bona fide</italic> CADs, and may be likely main candidate gene for lignin biosynthesis in melon. However, little information is available on the role of CAD in relation to the lignification of melon flesh tissue during fruit development and ripening. These findings implied that melon CAD genes might also be involved in the lignification of flesh tissue, and there were difference in function among family members.</p><p>There were significant expression differences between <italic>CmCAD4</italic> and other <italic>CmCADs</italic> in different tissues and during development and ripening. These observed differences could partly be explained by the amino acids differences at position 58&#x02013;59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101730-g003">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>CmCAD4</italic> had a KL motif, whereas other <italic>CmCADs</italic> had an either EW or DL/EL motif. Furthermore, based on our analysis of <italic>CmCADs</italic>, <italic>CmCAD4</italic> had little key residues, and had a Ser123 instead of Asp123 which was suggested to be involved in determining the activity of all <italic>bona fide</italic> lignifying CADs; One mutation, D123S, resulted in a essentially inactive protein <xref rid="pone.0101730-Saathoff2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Purportedly, ABA-mediated plant responses to drought stress may be related to the regulation of relevant genes by the MYB transcription factor <xref rid="pone.0101730-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, to the best of our information, there were no reports on effect of ABA or IAA on ripening specific CADs. Promoter analysis of the five melon CADs suggested the presence of ABA responsive ABRE motif <xref rid="pone.0101730-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> in the promoter of <italic>CmCAD1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, 3 and <italic>5</italic>, and the promoter of <italic>CmCAD1</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> contains response elements (TGA) to IAA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101730.s008">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, the ABA-induced these <italic>CmCADs</italic> expression observed in present study may be related to the upstream MYB response elements. However this speculation has to be demonstrated by further cloning and function analyses of the promoter of <italic>CmCADs</italic>. Auxin (IAA) also plays a role in fruit development and ripening. Trainotti et al. <xref rid="pone.0101730-Trainotti1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showed that there was an active crosstalk between IAA and ethylene that was important for the regulation of ripening. However, in case of melon, there were not reports about the inducing of ripening in mature fruit by IAA as done by ethylene. Of these, <italic>CmCAD1</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> expression were induced under IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101730-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101730.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and other CAD genes were expressed at basal level but did not appear to be significantly regulated by IAA.</p><p>The promoter analysis of the five CAD genes revealed the presence ethylene responsive ERE motifs in <italic>CmCAD3</italic> and <italic>CmCAD5</italic> which have been shown to be responsive to ethylene treatment <xref rid="pone.0101730-Tesniere1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101730-Verries1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101730.s008">Table S1</xref>).

Induced <italic>GbCAD1</italic> expression by ethylene may be related to enhancing PAL activity and subsequent product accumulation<xref rid="pone.0101730-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It is known to all that the biosynthesis of lignin in higher plants originates in the phenylalanine metabolic pathway. Therefore, the regulation of lignification and <italic>CmCADs</italic> expression of melon fruit tissue by ethylene during ripening may be related to the control in upstream of the phenylalanine metabolic pathway.</p><p>Additionally, we also identified several hormone-responsive cis-regulatory elements in the <italic>CmCADs</italic> promoter region, such as GARE, TATC-box, P-box (gibberellin), TCA-element (Salicylic acid), CCAAT-box, TGACG-motif and CGTCA-motif (MeJA)<xref rid="pone.0101730-Barakat1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0101730.s008">Table S1</xref>). A complex interplay of hormones is known to affect fruit development and ripening with auxin and GA being important during fruit expansion and ABA and ethylene for ripening <xref rid="pone.0101730-Srivastava1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In oriental sweet melon <italic>(Cucumis melo</italic> var. <italic>makuwa</italic> Makino), there are different ripening patterns within the fruit. The ripening of oriental sweet melon is initiated from the flesh and moves gradually towards the fruit cavity and the peel, and is earlier near the bottom and later at the carpopodium. The regulation pattern of ripening by hormones may selectively affect the expression of one or the other CADs. It also needs to be work out whether the regulation of hormones on different CAD gene members help in maintaining the net levels of CAD in fruit during ripening. These findings implied a complex hormonal regulation of the genes during fruit development and ripening and under stress conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, we identified five <italic>CmCADs</italic> in melon, phylogenetic analysis indicated that they belonged to four different groups, and <italic>CmCAD</italic> genes may function in process of fruit tissue lignification and in lignin biosynthesis in xylem and under different stress conditions through a CAD genes network.
