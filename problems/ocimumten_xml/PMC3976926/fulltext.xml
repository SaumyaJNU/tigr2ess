Introduction</title><p>Excessive levels of heavy metals in agricultural lands constitute an increasingly serious threat not only for intact plant growth and yield but also for the environment and human health [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The toxicity of plants due to heavy metals, particularly on agricultural economic crops, presents a challenge to plant scientists concerned with yield and quality in crop production [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These metals retard farming efficiency and destroy the health of the plants and animals [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some heavy metals such as chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd), especially in large amounts, could affect growth and productivity of plants [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They are usually accumulated due to unplanned municipal waste disposal, mining, use of extensive pesticides, and chemical fertilizers [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays, contamination of the environment by Cr has become a major concern and its toxicity to plants depends on its valence state with Cr(VI) being highly toxic and mobile than Cr(III) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cr(III) occurs naturally in the environment and is an essential nutrient, whereas Cr(VI) is generally produced by industrial processes [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is found in all parts of the environment including air, water, rocks, and soil [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The anthropogenic sources of Cr input are electroplating, mining processing, wood preservation, iron and steel production, pigment manufacture, power station industry, leather tanning, textile preservation, textile printing, paint and porcelain manufacturing, and during combustion of coal and petroleum [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Significant quantities of Cr are also added to soil by the disposal of fly ash as well as phosphatic fertilizer application [10].</p><p>There are a number of factors which influence plant growth, among them nitrogen is one of the most essential elements and its availability in soil is one of the key factors for determining plant growth and productivity [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nitrogen is considered to be a vital macronutrient for plants and has a role in metabolism [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is incorporated in plant tissues as nucleotides, nucleic acids, coenzymes, vitamins, pigments, alkaloids, amines, and other compounds [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is structural component of wide array of vital biomolecules, such as amino acids, proteins, nucleotides, porphyrins, several coenzymes, chlorophylls, vitamins, and glycosides. On average, proteins and nucleic acids contain about 15% and 13% nitrogen, respectively [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, the maintenance of proper N-metabolism of plant can lead to proper growth and development of plant. The nitrogen metabolism and enzymology are related to the selection of high yielding crops. It has been shown that enzymes of nitrogen metabolism are severely affected by different metals and thus reduced crop yields. The nitrogen metabolism is of central importance under stressful conditions [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>According to Dixit et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Cr is toxic to plants and interferes with several metabolic processes as exhibited by reduced seed germination or early seedling development, induced chlorosis in young leaves, reduced pigment content, damaged root cells, impaired photosynthesis, altered enzymatic function, stunted growth, and plant death [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In India, Cr(VI) contamination is a major problem around various industries using Cr compounds, which causes considerable negative impact on crop production [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Clusterbean (<italic>Cyamopsis tetragonoloba </italic>L.) has been grown in India since ancient times for vegetables and fodder purposes. It is an important<italic> kharif</italic> legume commonly known as guar and is cultivated throughout India for its edible pods. Its green pods are used as vegetable, seeds as source of industrial gum, and green plants as fodder and for soil manuring purposes. It has recently assumed great industrial importance due to the presence of gum, that is, galactomannan, in its endosperm which constitutes 25&#x02013;35% of whole seeds and is highly mucilaginous. Gum is used extensively in paper, mining, explosive, food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, textiles, and oil industries [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In Haryana (a major guar producing state), Sonepat, Panipat, Dharuhera, Gurgaon, Yamunanagar, Faridabad, and Shahabad are the main industrial areas, where poor plant growth of field crops has been observed. Contamination of soils by heavy metals as a result of human, agricultural, and industrial activities is a major cause of poor plant growth [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, not much work has been reported on the effect of Cr(VI) on guar. Considering the above facts and the importance of nitrogen in plant growth, the present study was carried out to explore the effect of Cr(VI) on nitrogen metabolism in clusterbean which will be beneficial to the understanding of Cr(VI) induced changes in plant nitrogen metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

In control as well as Cr treated plants, SNA increased abruptly from day 30 onwards to evince maximum value at day 50 and after that declined at 65 DAS. According to Balestrasse et al. [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], high cadmium concentration or salt stress resulted in oxidative stress with increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content and decreased leghemoglobin level and, consequently, decreased SNA. Decreased SNA may also be due to the effect of heavy metal ions on O<sub>2</sub> uptake by bacteroid which could result in inhibition of acetylene reduction activity. Bacteroid respiration provides the energy and reducing power that nitrogenase needs for efficient nitrogen fixation [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Under a high concentration of metals, the decreased SNA might also be due to decreased nodule number and their biomass [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], induced nodule senescence [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], altered nodule ultrastructure [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and/or altered plant growth-promoting activities of microorganisms [34].</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Nitrate Reductase</title><p>NR is the first enzyme in the process of nitrate reduction and plays an important role in nitrogen assimilation by catalyzing the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Nitrate is the common source of nitrogen available to plants. Once nitrate is being absorbed by plants it may be reduced in roots, stored in the vacuoles, or transferred to the shoots before being processed. The conversion of nitrate into ammonia is brought about by successive and regulated action of NR and NiR [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is affected by plant development stages and plant parts such as roots and tops and environmental conditions [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cr application in soil was found to have negative effect on the NR specific activity (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of nitrite produced h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein). The specific activity was decreased by 70.1, 71.9, and 74.9% in leaves, 57.6, 55.9, and 59.2% in stem, and 63.4, 57.3, and 65.0% in root of 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil treated plants over control at 30, 50, and 65 DAS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In each treatment, NR specific activity in various plant parts increased with plant age, attaining the maximum value at 50 DAS, and decreased thereafter at 65 DAS. Root had higher specific activity followed by stem and leaves.</p><p>Cr-induced toxicity resulting in reduced activity of NR was also reported in sorghum and Indian mustard [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Study on wheat and Indian mustard revealed that lower doses of Cr had stimulatory effects, while higher doses had inhibitory effects on NR activity [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A significant increase in NR activity was observed corresponding to Cr concentration in<italic> Brassica juncea </italic>[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, in the present study, no stimulatory effect of low Cr(VI) concentration was observed. The results are in conformity with the observation of Kumar and Joshi [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], where NR specific activity decreased with increase in Cr(VI) concentration. It is suggested that a negative influence of Cr on NR specific activity might be due to a reduced supply of NADH which might result from disorganization of chloroplasts, reduced rate of photosynthesis, respiration, NADH oxidation, or reduction in NO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> supply to the site of the enzyme as a consequence of water stress induced by the metal and direct effect of heavy metals on protein synthesis [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similar results have been observed by Rai et al. [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], where Cr toxicity resulted in the reduction of nitrate reductase activity through impaired substrate utilization in<italic> Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Nitrite Reductase</title><p>NiR catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to ammonium in the second step of the nitrate assimilation pathway. A decrease in NiR specific activity (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of nitrite reduced h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein) was observed in leaves, stem, and roots of clusterbean plant treated with Cr(VI) in comparison to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to nitrate reductase, specific activity of nitrite reductase also decreased with increasing level of Cr(VI) at different stages of growth. The maximum decrease in NiR specific activity as compared to control was 56.0, 57.6, and 54.0% in leaves, 56.7, 53.6, and 56.6% in stem, and 64.1, 61.3, and 55.7% in root with 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil treated plants at 30, 50, and 65 DAS, respectively.

The observed decrease in NiR activity may be due to either of reduced carbon fixation, NO<sub>3</sub>

<sup>&#x02212;</sup> reduction. Moreover, it has been shown that the accumulation of NH<sub>4</sub>

Therefore, under 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil treatment, the increase in NH<sub>4</sub>

The observed decrease in NiR activity may either be due to reduced carbon fixation or low nitrate translocation in the xylem and, subsequently, low nitrate availability in shoot or reduced uptake of nitrate by roots or limitation in reducing power [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. Glutamine Synthetase</title><p>Ammonia is primarily assimilated through glutamine synthetase via GS/GOGAT pathway. Inorganic nitrogen could be assimilated by plants into the forms of glutamine and glutamic acid. GS is a key enzyme for nitrogen assimilation, which regulates nitrogen metabolism [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is involved in the assimilation of ammonia derived either from nitrate reduction, N<sub>2</sub> fixation, photo respiration, or asparagine breakdown. In the present study, the specific activity of GS was progressively decreased in leaves, stem, and root of clusterbean plants treated with increasing dosages of Cr(VI). The gradual decrease in GS specific activity (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of&#x02009;&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>-GMH formed h<sup><italic>&#x02012;</italic>1&#x02009;</sup>mg<sup><italic>&#x02012;</italic>1</sup> protein) was observed at all stages of growth. Maximum decline in enzyme specific activity was recorded at 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil at all stages of growth. Compared to control, a 59.6, 56.7, and 65.7% decrease in its specific activity was observed at 50 DAS in leaves, stem, and root of plants treated with 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil, respectively. The enzyme specific activity increased from vegetative to flowering stage and then declined in different plant parts at the grain filling stage (i.e., 65 DAS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of GS activity has also been described in barley seedlings [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The decreased availability of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, which act as cofactors in various metabolic processes, may be the possible reason for the observed decrease in GS activity. Moreover, decreased activity in GS may also be responsible for increased NH<sub>4</sub>

Glutamate Synthase</title><p>The key enzyme involved in the<italic> de novo</italic> synthesis of glutamate is glutamate synthase, also known as glutamine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. The acidic amino acid is formed by the action of glutamate synthase, utilizing glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate. The reaction is a reductant-driven transfer of the amide amino group of glutamine to 2-oxoglutarate to yield two molecules of glutamate [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The specific activity of GOGAT (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M NADH oxidized h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein) in various plant parts decreased significantly with increasing concentration of Cr(VI) at all stages of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Amongst the Cr(VI) levels, 2.0&#x02009;mg&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil had a maximum adverse effect on its specific activity.

The specific activity increased continuously in leaves, stem, and root up to 50 DAS and decreased thereafter at 65 DAS in each individual treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is suggested that Cr may also induce premature senescence of plants through an increased level of NH<sub>4</sub>

Glutamate Dehydrogenase</title><p>In addition to GS and GOGAT, another enzyme potentially involved in ammonia metabolism is GDH. It can catalyze the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate and the reverse catabolic reaction of oxidative deamination of glutamate. It is located in the mitochondrial matrix where it is mainly responsible for glutamate catabolism under carbon and N-limiting conditions [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Glutamate dehydrogenase is present in the leaves, roots, and nodules in abundance [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Robinson et al. [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] have suggested that GDH activity is altered in response to shifts in carbon rather than nitrogen metabolism. Increasing the concentration of Cr(VI) from 0.0 to 2.0&#x02009;mg Cr(VI)&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> soil resulted in a decrease in GDH specific activity (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M NAD<sup>+</sup> formed h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein) at different stages of growth in different plant parts.

Burzy&#x00144;ski and Buczek [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] studied the influence of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> at various pH conditions (5.0, 6.0, and 7.0) on the uptake and assimilation of ammonia by cucumber seedlings and found that GS and NADH-GDH were also inhibited after 1&#x02009;h of plant exposure to these metals. Joshi et al. [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported that the activity of GDH was increased in different plant parts of cowpea with Cr(VI) concentration up to 1&#x02009;ppm and then decreased with further increase in it till 6&#x02009;ppm. During the present study, GDH activity also decreased under Cr(VI) treatments. Heavy metals like Ni and Al treatments also impaired the nitrate assimilation process in rice seedlings by inhibiting the activities of key nitrogen assimilatory enzymes, that is, NR, GS, and GDH [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Evidence showed that GDH is not involved in ammonia assimilation, which occurs solely via the GS/GOGAT cycle. It was hypothesized that the primary role of GDH is the catabolism of glutamate to provide carbon skeletons for the TCA cycle function under conditions of carbon limitation, and consequently, this enzyme fulfills an important anapleurotic function linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism in higher plants [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that Cr(VI) application adversely affected nitrogen metabolism by inhibiting the activity of these enzymes and growth of clusterbean plants, possibly as a result of its interference with photosynthetic pigments and key enzymes of nitrogen metabolism. The increased accumulation of Cr in plant parts negatively affected nitrogen metabolism. It may have further implications in designing and conducting similar studies as well as understanding the detailed mechanism of this toxicity and its removal thereafter.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the Head, Department of Biochemistry and Director Research, CCSHAU, Hisar for providing the necessary infrastructural facility.
