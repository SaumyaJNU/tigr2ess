    "The rewards of using plants and plant metabolites over other biological methods for nanoparticle synthesis have fascinated researchers to investigate mechanisms of metal ions uptake and bio-reduction by plants. Here, green chemistry were employed for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using leaf extracts of Ocimum Sanctum (Tulsi) and its derivative quercetin (flavonoid present in Tulsi) separately as precursors to investigate the role of biomolecules present in Tulsi in the formation of AgNPs from cationic silver under different physicochemical conditions such as pH, temperature, reaction time and reactants concentration. The size, shape, morphology, and stability of resultant AgNPs were investigated by optical spectroscopy (absorption, photoluminescence (PL), PL-lifetime and Fourier transform infrared), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The enhanced antibacterial activity of AgNPs against E-Coli gram-negative bacterial strains was analyzed based on the zone of inhibition and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) indices. The results of different characterization techniques showed that AgNPs synthesized using both leaf extract and neat quercetin separately followed the same optical, morphological, and antibacterial characteristics, demonstrating that biomolecules (quercetin) present in Tulsi are mainly responsible for the reduction of metal ions to metal nanoparticles."
