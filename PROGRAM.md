# ContentMine workshop for TIGR2ESS

A full day work shop to introduce TIGR2ESS delegates to the principles and practice of ContentMining (aka Text and Data Mining, TDM) for plant science 
research.

## Overview

### background
The scientific/medical literature generates thousands of articles per day, and is continuing to increase. This workshop uses a subset, 
the Open Access subset in Europe PubMedCentral (EPMC) which though not comprehensive is up-to-date. It is well suited for rapid overviews 
of subjects, concepts and entities. TDM of the whole literature is messy and difficult but The NIH/NLM has required Open articles to be 
converted to JATS/XML which is easy to download, search and analyse. Although the NIH concentrates on medical literature, they index
enough plant science to find very valuable new insights and summaries.

All the techniques in this workshop are generally valuable in all scientific fields. The major limitation is the availability of open, 
semantic fulltext but the development of preprints and Open Access should imprive this rapidly.

### goals
Delegates will learn how to:
 * search EPMC for plant science articles
 * download and organize them in Content Mine projects (CProjects)
 * understand the power of Wikidata for plant sciences and run searches.
 * create small dictionaries of relevance to TIGR2ESS. 
 * use dictionaries to search downloaded data for terms (entities) of special interest (typically genes, plant species, plant parts, phytochemicals, human diseases,
   countries, funding agencies).
 * analyze the frequency of entities (showing what the "literature" is most interested in).
 * plot the co-occurrence of terms (e.g. plants associated with disease).

### setup
All work is on delgates' laptops. They will need to:
 * install the ContentMine software ("getpapers" and "AMI")
 * verify it works on tests
 * run the specific exercises in the tutorial
 * be able to use a JSON editor for editing dictionaries
 
 Ideally the technology for this should be varified before the full-day workshop
 
 ## Exercises 
This lists the formal exercises that we will carry out. All exercises will be verified beforehand to ensure that they:
 * work on major operating systems and hardware. 
 * can be edited in case of variable download speeds or unexpected drop-outs.
 
 The following order of exercises may change.

 ### getpapers
 Download a subset of the *Ocimum* papers in EPMC using <tt>getpapers<tt>.
