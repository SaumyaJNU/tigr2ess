#Getting Started

The two essential ContentMine tools are:
* `getpapers` (to search EuropePMC) and download hundreds/thousands of articles. [getpapers](getpapers.md). This page contains queries and results for "Holy basil" (Suggested by Ambarish Kumar).
* `ami` to analyze the downloaded papers in detail.  [ami](ami.md)

These tools have their own installation instructions. They rely on the user downloading and installing standard software and then the two programs.
