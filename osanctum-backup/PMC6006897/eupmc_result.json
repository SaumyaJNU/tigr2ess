    "Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is widely used endodontic irrigant with its array of advantages and disadvantages. Addition of herbal agents to NaOCl might help in enhancing its efficacy.NaOCl was prepared using chlorinated lime, anhydrous sodium carbonate, and distilled water to obtain 6% fresh solution. Then, this solution was evaluated for its pH and chlorine content. The fresh herbal extract of Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass), Mentha piperita (peppermint), and Ocimum sanctum (tulsi) was prepared from plant leaves. After which, various permutation and combinations were made, and it was found that 9:1 ratio was the most effective combination. The pH and percentage of free chlorine were evaluated and analyzed.No statistical significant difference was found in pH content. However, significant difference was found between the groups for chlorine content (P < 0.05) of herbal NaOCl.The current study presents a simplified method for preparation of herbal irrigating solution."
