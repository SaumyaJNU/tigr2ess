    "Ocimum kilimandscharicum is unique in possessing terpenoids whereas other Ocimum species are renowned for phenylpropanoids as major constituents of essential oil. The key enzyme of MVA/terpenoid metabolic pathway viz 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co-A reductase (OkHMGR) of 1.7-Kb ORF encoding ~60-kDa protein was cloned from O. kilimandscharicum and its kinetic characteristics revealed the availability of HMG-CoA as a control point of MVA-pathway. Transcript profiling of the OkHMGR elucidated tissue-specific functions of the gene in flower and leaf tissues in accumulation of terpenoidal essential oil. OkHMGR was differentially regulated in response to exposure to methyl-jasmonate, salicylic-acid, and stress conditions such-as salt and temperature stress, demonstrating its key role in managing signaling and stress-responses. To elucidate its functional role, OkHMGR was transiently over-expressed in homologous and heterologous plants such as O. sanctum, O. basilicum, O. gratissimum, Withania somnifera and Artemisia annua. The over-expression and inhibition dual strategy revealed that the additional OkHMGR in-planta could afford endogenous flow of isoprenoid units towards synthesis of terpenoids. The present study provides in-depth insight of OkHMGR in regulation of biosynthesis of non-plastidal isoprenoids. This is first report on any gene of MVA/isoprenoid pathway from under-explored Camphor Tulsi belonging to genus Ocimum. Studies also suggested that OkHMGR could be a potential tool for attempting metabolic engineering for enhancing medicinally important terpenoidal metabolites in plants."
