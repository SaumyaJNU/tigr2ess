    "Herbal drugs, on which 80% of the world's population rely, are relatively safe over conventional drugs. Conventional drugs are costly, have serious side effects and hence over the past few decades researchers have focused on drug discovery from herbal medicines or botanical sources. The majority of new herbal drugs have been generated from secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds) of plant metabolism. Till date, only a small fraction of the vast diversity of plant metabolism has been explored for the production of new medicines and other products. The emergence of new herbal genomics research, medicinal plant genomics consortium, together with advances in other omics information may help for the speedy discovery of previously unknown metabolic pathways and enzymes. This review highlights the importance of genomics research in the discovery of some previously unknown enzymes/pathways which may make significant contributions in plant metabolic biology and may be used for the future discovery of many new pharmaceutical agents."
