It is the 7<sup>th</sup> foremost cause of death in the world. Approximately, 1.5 million deaths occurred in 2014 due to the Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a more common in developing countries. There were 366 million people suffering with Type 2 diabetes in 2011; these numbers will rise to 552 million by 2030 [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is one of the intractable diseases identified by Indian council of medical research for which an alternative medicine is need for the treatment herbal remedies are safe and fascinating move toward alternative medicine for diabetes complementary medicine because their benefits are well documented from a historical viewpoint in the population of diabetes [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most of the diabetics in India rely on the use of conventional medicines for the major health care needs [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the consumption of herbal preparation has been reported for their induction and inhibition potential on p-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pgp is an ATP-dependent multidrug efflux transporter and an absorption barrier by transporting some drug from intestinal cells from the lumen [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pgp is considered as one of the major barriers for bioavailability of orally administered drugs. Therefore, any alteration in expression and activity of Pgp will eventually result in increase or decrease in plasma concentration of Pgp substrate drug. Such herb-drug interaction may be hazardous if Pgp substrate drug levels reaching above toxicity thresholds or may change drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. Among various transporter proteins, Pgp is a major efflux protein that actively efflux the Pgp substrate in intestinal lumen.</p><p>Several compounds derived from the natural product and plant extracts have been reported to inhibit Pgp activity [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, <italic>Allium sativum</italic> L., <italic>Eugenia</italic>
<italic>jambolana</italic> Lam., <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> L., <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> Linn., and <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> L., which have been commonly used for the treatment of diabetes or consumed daily in Indian population [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], were monitored for their synergistic effect on intestinal Pgp efflux transporter. All these plants were used in the polyherbal formulation (PHF). The PHF has shown a significant antidiabetic effect on streptozotocin in induced diabetic rats (data are not shown in the manuscript). Here, we have estimated the effect of PHF on altering intestinal Pgp expression and its function. Alteration in Pgp expression was done using western blotting while modulation in the activity of Pgp was evaluated using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) transport study. To achieve these aims, we studied the effect of PHF administration on transcriptional level of Pgp and its functional activity in dose and time dependent manner.</p><p>The previous studies are only based on a single herbal active constituent. However, in Ayurvedic system of medicine practice, a combination of polyherbal preparations are prescribed but no such studies are documented in literature. Moreover, these formulations are also not told to prescribing physician by the patients. This may due to the ignorance of patients because these polyherbal preparations are not considered as a part of active medication. Prolong usage of these formulations may alter the expression of efflux transporters that finally leads to altered the bioavailability of antidiabetic or other Pgp substrate drugs that have narrow therapeutic index.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Reagents and Chemicals</title><p>Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), Rh123, bovine serum albumin (BSA), protease inhibitor cocktail, Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline (PBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium pentobarbital, Triton-X, TEMED, acryl and bis-acrylamide, ammonium persulfate and Evans blue were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).

Briefly, at the end of pre-treatment of PHF, rats were sacrificed, and ileum was excised out, then washed with normal saline, and everted using a glass rode. Small intestine was segmented into 4-5 cm long segments that were tied at one end. The Rh123 solution (25 &#x000b5;M in TC199) was filled in the serosal side and tightly ligated to make a gut sac. Immediately, this intestinal everted sac was placed in 30 ml of TC 199 medium. The solution was gassed by 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C during the experiment. Transport of the Rh123 across the serosal to the mucosal side was calculated by sampling 1 ml of the external medium every 10 min up to 80 min. The rate of Rh123 transport was expressed as &#x000b5;M or percentage secreted per minute in the mucosal compartment. In some experiments, Pgp inhibitor (verapamil 100 &#x000b5;M) was added in the mucosal and the serosal sides at the same concentration.

Any alteration in level and/or activity of this protein would ultimately result in the altered pharmacokinetics of substrate drug. Among various factors, consumption of herbal preparation is a major factor that can modulate the expression and/or activity of Pgp. Various herbal preparations have been reported to alter the expression and activity level of this protein, e.g., St. John Wort consumption increased the expression of Pgp that eventually decreased the bioavailability of cyclosporin resulting in rejection of tissue implant in the patient. Other clinical drug-drug and herb-drug interactions were reported in the literature between digoxin (Pgp substrate) and other Pgp substrates such as quinidine verapamil, talinolol, clarithromycin, traconazole, erythromycin, and propafenone [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Herbs in PHF that has been used from ancient times to improve glycemic control. However, no reports are available regarding the synergistic effect of this type formulation on Pgp. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated <italic>in-vivo</italic> effect of PHF administration in dose and time dependent manner in male SD rats. One possible method of estimating the induction/inhibitory potency of any compound to protein is measuring mRNA and protein levels. However, the relationship between mRNA and protein levels has not been established yet, and using mRNA and protein levels alone may misleading to the contribution of Pgp on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Assessing functional activity for induction/inhibition potential of any compound is supposed to be best because it is only the functional activity that comes to play the following treatment. However, in this study, we used all three methods to analyze the induction/inhibition potential of PHF. In our data, we obtained a decrease in mRNA and protein level of Pgp in intestine of rats with PHF treatment. The reason behind this phenomenon might be attributed to the overall exposure of intestine, which is more exposed to oral components compared to liver, kidney, and other parts of the body. Therefore, intestinal Pgp is considered a more important in determining the oral bioavailability of Pgp substrate drugs.</p><p>There is a not true measure of functional activity of Pgp either increase or decrease in mRNA and protein; we measure the functional activity both <italic>in-vivo</italic> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> following the PHF pretreatment using Rh123, as a typical Pgp substrate. The fluorescent dye Rh123 has been extensively used as index of Pgp-mediated transport in rodents and various tissue culture models [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Tian <italic>et al</italic>. (2002) reported that the measurements of Rh123 using a spectrofluorometer were as same as those using HPLC method in a transport study using the rat everted-sac method [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the use of spectrofluorometer in our study as a convenient tool can be rationalized.</p><p>Rh123 has been reported to be metabolized by intestinal esterase and some of its metabolite also has fluorescence intensities [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, it has been considered that intestinal esterase during the study had lesser effect on the fluorescence intensity of Rh123 in everted gut sac method because intestine was washed several times with normal saline before use and everted sac is in direct contact with only Rh123. Similarly, <italic>in-situ</italic> perfusion method also has much less effect on intestinal esterase activity because intestinal lumen was constantly perfused with buffer solution and samples were immediately analyzed.</p><p>In our study, Pgp mediated transport of Rh123 was significantly decreased with everted gut sac prepared from PHF pretreated rats (1-week pretreatment) compared to those prepared from vehicle treated rats. However, this transport inhibition due to the presence of PHF components in intestine was denied because the experiment was conducted after the 24 h of last PHF dose with fasting of rats for 8-12 h. This duration is sufficient for normal washout of intestinal contents. Therefore, a decrease in Pgp mediated transport of Rh123 was attributed to decrease in intestinal Pgp expression. This decrease in Pgp mediated transport was in agreement with decreased protein expression measured with mRNA level and protein level with western blot. However, we found that protein as well as mRNA levels were decreased. There are some studies that reported decrease in Pgp protein expression due to post-transcriptional modification. These post-transcriptional modifications can alter the expression of Pgp by two ways: One at glycosylation level and other at the trafficking of membrane protein. In the first scenario, the synthesized Pgp needs to be glycosylated to reach plasma membrane. An alteration at the glycosylation level would result in increased degradation of native protein that causes a decrease in Pgp expression. In the second case, the reduction of Pgp movement from cytoplasm to plasma membrane would also result in downregulation of Pgp expression. Such kind of regulation that occurred at trafficking level has been reported [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>To validate this hypothesis, we performed <italic>in-vivo</italic> functional activity assay (exsorption of Rh123). The result obtained in this experiment revealed that PHF pretreatment decreased the exsorption of Rh123 into intestinal lumen in comparison to control. These data support our hypothesis that increase in tissue concentration of Pgp substrates was due to downregulation in expression and activity of intestinal Pgp. In addition, Rh123 is not a CYP3A substrate, therefore, the modulation in distribution of Rh123 was attributed to decrease in Pgp expression only. These <italic>in-vivo</italic> results were in good agreement with the results, we obtained in western blot and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> everted gut sac. Therefore, the results obtained could be significantly attributed to downregulation of intestinal Pgp. Alteration in the expression and activity of Pgp with herbal constituents could also be a useful strategy to increase the oral bioavailability of Pgp substrate, in particular, to develop the oral formulations of antidiabetic drugs such as sitagliptin, glibenclamide, rosiglitazone and troglitazone, transported by Pgp transporter [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, further investigations to estimate quantitatively Pgp in human cell line like Caco-2, intestinal epithelial as well as pharmacokinetic studies with Pgp substrates are required to validate their effect to clinical implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study demonstrates that PHF pretreatment downregulated the expression of intestinal Pgp, and this downregulated intestinal Pgp would result in decreased functional activity. Based on these results, PHF inhibits the efflux activity of Pgp transporter which could play a key role in modulating the systemic availability of Pgp substrate drugs <italic>in vivo</italic>. It has been reported in literature that regular consumption of herbal preparation could alter the expression of Pgp in intestine and other tissues. In addition, this downregulated Pgp expression might affect the bioavailability of antidiabetic Pgp substrate drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Authors gratefully acknowledge the Department of Pharmacology, King George&#x02019;s Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, where the study was carried out.
