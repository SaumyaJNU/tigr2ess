Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a major cause of iatrogenic diseases, accounting for one in 600 to one in 3500 of all hospital admissions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Traditional medicine is the sum total of knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health as well as to prevent, diagnose, improve or treat physical and mental illnesses. Herbal treatments are the most popular form of traditional medicine. Herbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished herbal products that contain parts of plants or other plant materials as active ingredients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] However, no scientific data regarding the identity and effectiveness of these herbal products were available, except in the treatise of Ayurveda and Unani medicine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The World Health Organization (WHO) has laid emphasis on promoting the use of traditional medicine for health care.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Hence, we see afocus on research on traditional and herbal medicine, especially in developing countries, with individual as well as collaborative efforts by national research organizations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>There is an acute necessity of reliable hepatoprotective drugs in modern medical practice.</p><p>Plants and natural products have been used traditionally worldwide for the prevention and treatment of liver disease. Scientific research has supported the claims of the medicinal efficacy of several of these herbal compounds, as evidenced from the voluminous work on their hepatoprotective potentials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] More than 700 mono- and polyherbal formulations from over a hundred different plants are available for use.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Sacred or Holy Basil, i.e. Green Tulsi (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>), is a well known medicinal plant, which grows wild as well as in households and temples in India.

In groups C, D and E, the toxic effect of paracetamol was partly reversed in the animals. Compared with the PCM (experimental control) group, the C and E groups showed a significant increase in the albumin:globulin ratio and a significant decrease in the serum ALP, AST and ALT levels. However, no significant difference was observed in the total protein levels in these groups. Group E in comparison with silymarin (standard) showed a significant decrease in the serum AST and ALT alone. Thus, group C showed greater hepatoprotection than group E, considering the results of the LFT alone. Histology of the control group showed normal hepatic architecture [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. The group B animals exhibited areas of hepatic necrosis induced by paracetamol [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. The animals treated with PCM and OSE (group C), PCM and silymarin (group D) and PCM, OSE and silymarin (group E) [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>
&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">e</xref>, respectively] revealed appreciable protection of hepatic tissue from PCM.</p><p>PCM, used as a tool to induce hepatotoxicity in experimental animals, leads to covalent bonding of its toxic metabolite N-acetyl P bezoquinoneimine to sulfydryl groups of proteins. This causes exhaustion of reduced glutathione in the liver, resulting in cell necrosis and lipid peroxidation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] An increase in the level of transaminases and ALP is an indication of cellular leakage and loss of functional integrity of the hepatic cell membranes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>Administration of the alcoholic extract of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> leaves showed significant hepatoprotective activity, as shown previously in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Synergistic hepatoprotective activity was seen with the OSE + SILY group. The OSE group showed better hepatoprotection than the OSE + SILY group. But, the OSE and OSE + SILY combination showed lesser efficacy than SILY alone.</p><p>Eugenol, flavonoid and ursolic acid components, present in <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> leaves, have free radical scavenging and anti-lipoperoxidative effects. Therefore, the hepatoprotective effect of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> leaves may be due to the antioxidant properties of its constituents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] The membrane stabilizing property of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> is responsible for its hepatoprotective action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, the fixed oil of <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> contains linoleic acid, which is responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Hence, linoleic acid may also be responsible for reversing the inflammatory features associated with hepatic injury thus adding to the hepatoprotective effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Thus, the leaves of Tulsi (<italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic>) have highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) hepatoprotective activity.
