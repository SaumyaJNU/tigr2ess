For a diverse of reasons, patients prefer naturally occurring dietary substances over synthetic agents to prevent cancer. Vicenin-2 is largely available in a medicinal plant <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> and is an apigenin form, 6,8-di-C-glucoside, which has been reported to have a range of pharmacological values which includes antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer.

The data also indicated that Vicenin-2 can enhance the anticancer effects at lower concentration, which in turn decreases the side effects associated with Vicenin-2 on normal cells. It was well accepted that most conventional chemotherapeutic agents target rapidly dividing tumor cells and therefore have minor effects on the slow dividing and quiescent CRCs.<xref rid="b21-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Furthermore, the cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis induction in tumor cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents is the main efficient strategy to prevent the uncontrolled cell proliferation of cancer cells. The flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle results further support that a high percentage of HT-29 cancer cells was arrested in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase due to treatment with Vicenin-2, which is consistent with the results of other anticancer drugs.<xref rid="b23-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It has been reported that Vicenin-2 induces G<sub>2</sub>/M phase accumulation due to the enhanced level of cyclin B and decreased level of cyclin D1.<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CRC, and drugs that target the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway potentially reduce the tumor growth.<xref rid="b26-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Accumulation of free &#x003b2;-catenin in the cytosol due to activation of GSK-3&#x003b2; eventually translocates into the nucleus, thus trans-activating several target genes associated in tumorigenesis.<xref rid="b29-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Especially, the plant products effectively inhibit the &#x003b2;-catenin expression and inhibit the tumor formation. Emodin is a type of anthraquinone active substance that inhibits CRC cell invasion and migration by suppressing epithelial mesenchymal transition via the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway.<xref rid="b30-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Curcumin is known as yellow gold, and it suppresses the CRC proliferation by inhibiting Wnt/&#x003b2;-Catenin pathways via miR-130a (Dou et al<xref rid="b31-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). <italic>Telectadium dongnaiense</italic> and its constituents inhibit the CRC cell proliferation by inhibiting the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway. Consistent with the previous findings, treatment with Vicenin-2 downregulated the non-p-&#x003b2;-catenin along with a decrease in phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; (Kim et al<xref rid="b32-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, the effect of Vicenin-2 on TCF/LEF reporter assay revealed that Vicenin-2 reduced the binding of non-p-&#x003b2;-catenin to TCF/LEF promoter. These results are also favorable to suggest Vicenin-2 as a potential therapeutic candidate for reversing multidrug resistance of cancer cells due to its ability to inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.<xref rid="b30-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that Vicenin-2 inhibited cell viability, induced apoptosis, and led to cell-cycle arrest in HT-29 cells. Vicenin-2 inhibits the &#x003b2;-catenin expression and nuclear accumulation. In addition, this effect was mediated through the suppression of p-GSK-3&#x003b2;. Additionally, the expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins Bax, Cytochrome C, and caspase-3 were increased, whereas that of Bcl-2 was decreased following treatment with Vicenin-2. It was already reported that Vicenin-2 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through the activation of caspase-3.<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-1303" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway signaling axis might be a potent target for the novel treatment strategies of CRC. This study indicated that Vicenin-2 could play a beneficial role in the comprehensive clinical treatment of CRC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
