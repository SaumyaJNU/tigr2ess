It affects a large population of the society, especially middle-aged people. Arthritis involves the inflammation of joints (affecting one or more joints), causing pain and stiffness in the joints. It causes destruction of cartilage, bone and affects synovial joints which lead to deformity, destruction and disability of joints. This is growing clinical health problem throughout the world. There are different types of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, pseudo-gout, osteoarthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease and very commonly found among people. Arthritis might lead to poor physical function due to severe joint pain, hence it may adversely disturb the quality of life. The prevalence statistics of the arthritis reveal that Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects approximately 1% of the world population. Arthritis is widely prevalent in the American population and a leading cause of disability. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on arthritis in the United States; it has been reported that 54.4 million U.S. adults (approximately 25% of the total adult population) are suffering from arthritis. These figures of arthritis in adults are expected to increase up to 67 million by 2030. The total figures of doctor-diagnosed arthritis is projected to reach up to 78.4 million adults (25.9% of all adults) and the arthritis-attributable activity limitation in adults is expected to increase to 34.6 million (11.4% of all adults) by 2040 [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These data indicated that arthritis is a serious disorder which might be more prevalent than other known diseases like diabetes, cancer and AIDS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these growing problems of arthritis. Recent studies report that the occurrence of RA in Saudi Arabia is approximately found to be 2.2 per thousand people. Further, it is reported to be found more commonly in females in comparison to males, and prevalence of this disease increases with age. If RA patients remain untreated, it may lead to high morbidity and mortality. It is also said that RA has also resulted from cardiovascular diseases. In another recently conducted study in Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in patients suffering from RA and its relationship with C-reactive protein level was investigated. It is reported that hyperlipidemia is frequently found among patients suffering from RA and significantly linked to the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and disease activity. There are continuous efforts by the medical community and researchers to remove all obstacles in the management of RA around the world, particularly in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mechanism underlying the inflammatory progression of arthritis involved the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joints, which causes the proliferation of synoviocytes and damage to the bone and cartilage. Certain pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g., TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) are considered as the primary mediators which have a vital role in the pathophysiology of RA. These pro-inflammatory cytokines promote inflammation by tissue destruction, angiogenesis, and leukocyte linkage in RA. Some new drugs have been used to target these primary mediators for the management of RA [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although arthritis is considered as a disease of the joints, but abnormal immune responses may end up causing various articular manifestations. Furthermore, in certain cases, rheumatoid factor (RF) may also cause extra-articular findings. Various allopathic medications are employed in the management of arthritis. The corticosteroids (GCs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Commonly referred as NSAIDs) are used as first line drugs of choice for the treatment of arthritis. NSAIDs are most frequently used drugs as compared with corticosteroids. The mechanism of action of NSAIDs involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes both COX-1 and COX-2. GCs are steroid hormones, which act by binding to the glucocorticoid receptors. GCs plays vital role in the treatment of variety of diseases like asthma, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and sepsis etc. GCs have various pleiotropic actions with several potentially harmful side effects. Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory agents which can inhibit all stages of the inflammatory reactions. GCs are frequently used to treat a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Long term use of GCs use might lead to serious adverse effects like immune-suppression, fluid shifts, psychological changes and brain changes. Mechanism of corticosteroids action also involves the inhibition to the induction of COX enzyme. In addition to this, the corticosteroids also reduce the macrophage phagocytosis and interleukin-1 (IL-1) secretion in order to inhibit the release of lysosomal enzymes and collagenase [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The allopathic medications suffer from certain untoward effects. For instance sulfasalazine causes gastrointestinal disturbances, malaise and headache. Use of gold compounds is associated with skin rashes, mouth ulcers and blood dyscrasias and methotrexate may cause pulmonary fibrosis. Common side effects of NSAIDs include nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, skin reactions [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Herbal medications on the other hand, are devoid of such untoward effects. Natural products in the form of the conventional dosage forms have been used for a long time. Use of nanotechnology in drug delivery technique is relatively new to pharmaceutical technology. The size range of nanoparticles is &#x0003c;250 nm. Because of their very small size they are benefitted with various properties that could be used in drug delivery techniques. Various nanoformulations have been prepared for herbal components and their rich extracts. They have been proven to provide additional benefit over the conventional dosage forms. For example, paclitaxel provides enhanced anti-tumor activity in the form of nano-particles as compared to its conventional dosage form. <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extract, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract, curcumin and many more phytoconstituents have been modified into nano-type so as to provide additional benefit to the users, thereby increasing patient compliance [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In the present investigation a well-known Ayurvedic herbal drug <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> L was chosen for the undertaken research study. <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> is an important aromatic plant (Family Lamiaceae). It is commonly called as tulsi or holy basil. It is also known as <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> and is frequently used by many in the treatment of variety of disorders/diseases throughout the world. It is inhabitant to the Indian subcontinent and is abundantly found in India. It is a very popular herb in Ayurvedic system of medicine and holds the highest regard for both its medicinal properties and religious beliefs. It is said to be an &#x0201c;elixir of life&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Tulsi is known as &#x0201c;The Queen of Herbs,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Mother Medicine of Nature&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In India, tulsi has been accepted in many religious customs and lifestyle practice for various health benefits. Daily use of tulsi is believed to promote general health, wellbeing and prevent various diseases and illness. In addition to this, several <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> scientific studies have been published throughout the world that provide the scientific basis of the medicinal properties of tulsi. Tulsi possess a wide range of pharmacological actions and used in the treatment for the variety of disorders/diseases like arthritis, asthma, anxiety, back pain, cardiac disorders, cough, dysentery, diarrhea, eye diseases, fever, genitourinary disorders, indigestion, gastric disorders, malaria, skin diseases, vomiting, ringworm, insect, scorpion, and snake bites. Tulsi is considered as a potent adaptogen which helps to improve the adaptation to stress and offer great support to maintain homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The leaves have been reported to contain 0.7% volatile oil, comparing of eugenol (71%) and methyl eugenol (20%) and other constituents [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is reported in the literature that leaves extract contains a higher concentration of ursolic acid [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ursolic acid (UA) forms an indispensable part of Indian traditional system of medicine. Chemically speaking, UA is a triterpinoid and form an important constituent of Tulsi [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, it is also an important component of several herbal medicines marketed worldwide. UA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193451.g001">Fig 1</xref>) is known to possess analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-epileptic, hepato-protective, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-fertility, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-tuberculosis and anti-HIV activities [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0193451.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0193451.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Ursolic acid (3&#x003b2;-hydroxy-urs- 12-en-28-oic acid).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0193451.g001"/></fig><p>The preparation of crude extract is comparatively simple, easy, cheap and consume lesser time as compared with the manufacturing procedure of pure compounds. In addition to this, a crude extract contains natural active ingredients. The crude extracts also have potent pharmacological actions as compared to pure compound due to the synergistic outcome of the other compounds present in the extracts. Thus, in the current study, Ocimum leaf extract (OLE) was used instead of pure ursolic acid (UA). Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are lipid nano-particles of the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation. These lipid nanoparticles were prepared after the first generation; solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. NLCs are distinct from SLNs with respect to their solid matrix composition. SLNs contains solid lipids only, on the other hand, NLCs consist of the mixture of liquid and solid lipids. NLCs exhibit more advantages as compared with than SLNs since NLCs present a smaller amount of lipid matrix which might offer extended loading capacity and NLCs also overcome a number of possible problems encountered with SLNs like expulsion of the drug for the period of the storage, lower drug loading and higher water content of SLNs distribution [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

IL-1 and TNF- &#x003b1; collectively responsible to engage the leukocytes into the inflammatory joint in arthritis. TNF-&#x003b1; is a pleiotropic cytokine, mainly secreted by activated macrophages and monocytes. TNF-&#x003b1; regulates the immune cells and plays a vital role in both chronic and acute inflammation. TNF promotes the inflammatory response which causes autoimmune disorders like ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, etc. TNF-&#x003b1; is reported to be found in the serum and synovial fluid of arthritic patients and it has been linked with clinical symptoms as well as a laboratory marker of RA. The main approach to inhibit the progress of the RA by blocking the TNF-&#x003b1; signal by two ways. Firstly, to decrease the severity of inflammatory reactions and secondly by decreasing the damage to the bone in CFA induced arthritis in rats. IL-1 is an important inflammatory mediator which destroyed the synovial cells by promoting the prostaglandin (PGE2) synthesis and by production of fibroblast in the synovial fluid [<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193451.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

The gelling agent known as carbopol-934 was suitably utilized to convert the optimized NLCs formulation into gel. In the present study, it was found that OLE-loaded NLC provides enhanced transdermal flux value across rat skin. The in vivo data revealed that the analgesic effect of OLE-NLC gel was comparable to that of standard gel. Rat paw volume showed a depriving effect with enhanced RBC count and decreased WBC count. The results obtained in COX-1 and COX-2 study indicated that developed formulation has inhibitory effects against these enzymes, and also reduced the IL-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels. The above observations make it evident our in-house OLE- NLC gel was effective in arthritis management. Further, corroboration was done by radio-graphical analysis, which depicted a good recovery phase in the group treated with developed formulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, under grant no.
