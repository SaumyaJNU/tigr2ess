The presence of an UV active chromophore due to the phenyl ring provides great support to flavonoid identification and analysis. The typical feature not only makes flavonoids easy to detect but also provides important structural information that can distinguish the oxidation pattern and type of polyphenol. All flavonoid aglycones contain at least two aromatic rings and consequently, efficiently absorb UV light. The flavonoids in methanolic solutions typically yield two UV absorption peaks: The first maximum, which is found in the 240&#x02013;285 nm range (Band I), is due to the A-ring benzoyl system - and the second maximum, which is in the 300&#x02013;400 nm range (Band II), to the substitution pattern and conjugation of the B-ring cinnamoyl system. Band A lies in the 310&#x02013;350 nm and 350&#x02013;385 nm range for flavones and flavonols respectively. While, Band B, remains same in the 250&#x02013;290 nm range for both of all flavones and flavonols subgroup of flavonoid. In flavanones and dihydroflavonols, band A is often reduced to little more than a shoulder at 300&#x02013;330 nm and Band B, in the 277&#x02013;295 nm range, is the main peak. Consequently, these two subgroups cannot be distinguished by simple UV-Visible analysis. Flavanols show &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> at nonspecific wavelengths between 270 nm and 290 nm, at which many phenolics absorb, thus not allowing their selective detection. UV spectral data of major eight peaks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] showed two absorptions at &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> the range of 238&#x02013;240 nm of Band II and another at the range of 307&#x02013;354 nm of Band I indicated that these compounds tentatively belongs to 3-substituted flavonol or flavones. UV-Visible spectra of each peak used as an indicative tool for the characterization of C-ring, whereas the MS spectra provided additional significant information.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Despite considerable progress in the treatment of diseases and disorders using modern therapeutic agents, search for newer drugs continues because the existing synthetic drugs have several limitations. Long-term administration of NSAIDs for the treatment of inflammation, pain and fever may cause severe complications includes gastric ulcer, renal damage, bronchospasm and cardiac abnormalities.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, new anti-inflammatory, analgesic drugs having lesser effects are being searched all over the world as alternatives to NSAIDs.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Medicinal and Aromatic Plants are recognized for their ability to produce a wealth of secondary metabolites and are being used in human health from several generations. The majority of plant-derived leads showed potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Roots of OS are waste biomass after the harvesting of herb. Hence, suitable methods should be adopted to minimize the pollution of environment by converting waste materials to value added products. The present study was carried out to determine the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic profile of OS root extracts using small laboratory animals.</p><p>Carrageenan induced inflammation in rat paw is a suitable model for evaluating anti-inflammatory agents acting by inhibiting the mediators of acute inflammation.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] OS root extracts coded as STE, STB, STW, STC, STH exhibited significant reduction in paw edema volume. STE showed paw edema inhibition in dose dependent manner. Anti-inflammatory activity of STE might be attributed due to the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory mediators of acute inflammation such as histamine and prostaglandin.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] STE, a most active extract was further explored for analgesic and antipyretic activity in small animal model.</p><p>Analgesic profile of STE was studied using chemical and thermal induced pain model. These include the acetic acid induced writhing test and formalin induced paw licking test as chemical-induced pain model, whereas hot plate latency test and tail immersion test as thermal-induced pain model. STE exhibited significant inhibition of acetic acid induced writing and formalin induced paw licking in dose-dependent manner. Intra-peritoneal injection of acetic acid caused writhing by increasing the level of prostaglandins in peritoneal fluids.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Prostaglandins activate peripheral nociceptors to induce abdominal constrictions.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Hence, it is necessary to inhibit the COX enzyme for reducing the writhing. The paw licking induced by subcutaneous injection of formalin as a peripheral noxious stimulus involving two phases of biphasic nociceptive responses. The first phase (neurogenic pain) is occur by direct chemical stimulation of nociceptive afferent fibers (predominantly C fibers), which can be inhibit by opiates like morphine.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The second phase (inflammatory phase) is due to release of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, serotonin, histamine and bradykinin in peripheral tissues.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Acetic acid-induced writhing test does not confirm whether STE acts centrally or peripherally. To find out the centrally acting analgesic role of STE, hot plate latency and tail immersion test was performed. Latency period in hot plate and tail immersion test was significantly increased in STE administered mice as compared to the vehicle administered control mice in dose dependent manner. This finding showed that STE also have centrally acting analgesic role. Thermal induced pain model produced response by different grades of centrally acting noxious stimuli. The tail immersion shows spinal reflexes to nociceptive stimuli and the hot plate produced analgesic activity supraspinally.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>STE reduce the Brewer's yeast induced rectal temperature and exhibit antipyretic activity in a dose dependent manner. Subcutaneous injection of Brewer's yeast causes pyrexia by enhances the production of prostaglandin which ultimately increase the body temperature. This production can be prevented by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Acute toxicity study showed that a single oral administration of STE (2000 mg/kg) did not produce any mortality, behavioural changes (gait, posture, fur, depression, panting) as well as no significant changes were recorded in serum biochemical (SGOT, SGPT, ALKP, creatinine Cholestrol, Triglyceride) and haematology parameters (RBCs, WBCs and Haemoglobin) in the mice as compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>It is believed that the therapeutic effects of any herbal product are because of collective response of multiple chemical constituents. Therefore, it is necessary to define as many phytochemicals as possible in order to recognize and explain the bioactivity. It is essential to develop a highly structured and well defined chemical profile or fingerprint of the active fraction. RP-HPLC coupled with diode array detection provides an efficient method for rapid identification of chemical profiles of the compounds with chromophoric groups like, flavonoids. Preliminary phytochemical screening of the STE shows the presence of flavonoids. Flavonoids act as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting the chemical mediators of the inflammatory response in the same way as the NSAIDs, that is, by inhibiting the enzymes that cause the synthesis of prostaglandins.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study revealed that ethyl acetate extract of OS roots (STE) exhibits the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic activity. Further investigations are needed in order to isolate the active ingredients in the ethyl acetate extract of OS roots that is responsible for pharmacological activities and to elucidate the mechanism of action of these active ingredients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors are highly grateful to the Director CSIR-CIMAP for Providing necessary facilities and
